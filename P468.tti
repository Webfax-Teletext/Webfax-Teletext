OL,10,F"You don't see as many muslims as you
OL,11,Fwant within the football industry. So
OL,12,FI think it's really good to help build
OL,13,Fthat. I wouldn't like to be that guy
OL,14,Fbut someone could possibly be an
OL,15,Finspiration to some of the youth and
OL,16,Finspire them to go into football."
OL,18,FSome of footballers have faced
OL,19,Fincidents of racial abuse in recent
OL,20,Fyears, however Bashir says he hasn't
OL,21,Ffaced prejudice in football.
