OL,6,FIt is undoubtedly a topic many find
OL,7,Fhard to discuss but one which affects
OL,8,Fthousands of families across Wales.
OL,10,FPregnancy or baby loss can have a
OL,11,Fprofound impact on people and often
OL,12,Fleaves families feeling isolated and
OL,13,Flonely.
OL,15,FHowever, a quarter of people in Wales
OL,16,Fwho had been personally affected said
OL,17,Fthey felt like they or their baby
OL,18,Fdidn't matter, after no-one asked them
OL,19,Fabout what had happened.
