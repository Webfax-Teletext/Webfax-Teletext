OL,6,FA Newport hospice says it may have to
OL,7,Fclose its doors due to rising costs
OL,8,Fand a "funding crisis."
OL,10,FSt David's Hospice Care is one of 15
OL,11,Fcharitable hospices in Wales. While it
OL,12,Freceives some funding from the Welsh
OL,13,FGovernment, it must independently
OL,14,Fraise approximately 70% of its running
OL,15,Fcosts.
OL,17,FHospices support around 13,000 people
OL,18,Fin Wales each year, but financial
OL,19,Fpressures mean the future is uncertain.
