OL,6,FThere are calls for the Welsh
OL,7,FGovernment to step up its support for
OL,8,Fkinship carers and the roughly 9,500
OL,9,FWelsh children who rely on them.
OL,11,FKinship is an alternative to foster
OL,12,Fcare which sees looked after children
OL,13,Fremain with friends or a family
OL,14,Fmember, rather than being taken into
OL,15,Fthe care system.
OL,17,FIt means children who cannot live with
OL,18,Ftheir parents for whatever reason are
OL,19,Fstill able to retain a connection with
OL,20,Ftheir families and limit further
OL,21,Fdisruption in their lives.

OL,13,FIt also found that 14% of carers were
