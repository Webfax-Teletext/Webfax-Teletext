OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV Cymru Wales, Dr
OL,7,FShakeel Ahmad, lead stroke clinician
OL,8,Ffor Wales, said when a patient has an
OL,9,Fartery blocked, it needs to be
OL,10,Funblocked as soon as possible by
OL,11,Fthrombolysis or thrombectomy. However,
OL,12,Fthis has to be done very quickly in
OL,13,Forder for it to work.
OL,15,FTypically, a potential stroke patient
OL,16,Fwould be taken to have a scan and it
OL,17,Fwould then go for reporting with the
OL,18,Fdoctor simultaneously looking after
OL,19,Fseveral other patients.

OL,6,FThis standard pathway can see it take
OL,7,Fup to 30-60 minutes to analyse the
OL,8,Fscan, whereas if the new AI technology
OL,9,Fdetects a potential blockage, it sends
OL,10,Fa ping to a consultant immediately who
OL,11,Fcan then look at the images on their
OL,12,Fphone. This speeds up the process as
OL,13,Fthey are able to make a decision on
OL,14,Ftreatment there and then.
OL,16,FHowever, the treatments aren't
OL,17,Fsuitable for every stroke patient,
OL,18,Fwith around one in five eligible for
