OL,6,FPolice have launched a new appeal to
OL,7,Ffind out who attacked a man on a
OL,8,FCardiff street over two decades ago.
OL,10,FLeon Adams survived a brutal attack
OL,11,Foutside Grangetown Railway Station,
OL,12,Fbut he required 24-hour care for the
OL,13,Frest of his life.
OL,15,FHe died on Boxing Day 2024 aged 47. An
OL,16,Finquest found that the brain injury
OL,17,Fsustained in the 2002 assault, when he
OL,18,Fwas 24, contributed to his death.
