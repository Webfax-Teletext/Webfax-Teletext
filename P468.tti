OL,7,Fusing his experience of being
OL,8,Fdiagnosed with cancer to help teach
OL,9,Fdental students how to spot the signs
OL,10,Fof the disease.
OL,12,FFour years before he was due to
OL,13,Fretire, Bryan Webber was diagnosed
OL,14,Fwith tonsil cancer.
OL,16,F"In December 2019, I felt a lump in my
OL,17,Fneck so I had a look in my mouth and
OL,18,Fthings didn't look particularly good",
OL,19,Fsaid Bryan.

OL,6,FPEARL differs from tradition
OL,7,Fradiotherapy, which targets a tumour
OL,8,Fand the surrounding area for the full

OL,10,Fthat's exposed doesn't get any
