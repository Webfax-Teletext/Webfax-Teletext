OL,13,Fabout being late on stage because she
OL,14,Fcould only do 20mph - a dig at the
OL,15,FLabour Welsh Government's
OL,16,Fcontroversial speed policy.
OL,18,FShe told members she'd use her

OL,6,F"If you ask people in Wales they do

OL,11,F"We have some migrant hotels and
OL,12,Fpeople are worried about the safety of

OL,16,FShe also defended claims that some of
