OL,9,Ffinding a solution more than a year
OL,10,Fafter it first appeared.
OL,12,FCwmfelin Social Club closed its doors
OL,13,Fin August 2023 after a sinkhole
OL,14,Fappeared in the club's car park,
OL,15,Fforcing 600 members and 20 employees
OL,16,Fto leave the building.
OL,18,FA culvert 10 meters under the club and
OL,19,Fa disused tramline are believed to be
OL,20,Fthe reasons for the vast cavity.
