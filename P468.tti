OL,6,FThe Welsh Rugby Union says it intends
OL,7,Fto apologise to its women's team
OL,8,Fplayers following contractual
OL,9,Fdiscussions which descended into chaos
OL,10,Fearlier this year.
OL,12,FIn September, the governing body
OL,13,Fannounced that 37 of its elite female
OL,14,Fplayers had signed fresh professional
OL,15,Fcontracts, stating the deal was one of
OL,16,Fthe most lucrative in the women's game.
OL,18,FBut the manner in which the
OL,19,Fnegotiations was conducted has now
OL,20,Fbeen the subject of the WRU's latest
OL,21,Freview.
