OL,13,FShe said, "The point is to highlight

OL,6,FAlex Harrison, Disability Wales'
OL,7,FDisability Equality Officer, says
OL,8,Fdisabled people often have to go
OL,9,Fwithout luxury on their wedding day,
OL,10,Fbut encounter many hurdles as a result.
OL,12,F"We see it constantly. Organising a

OL,14,Fall these extra barriers to work
OL,15,Fthrough. I think there needs to be
OL,16,Fmore understanding and I think

OL,19,Fpeople like to get married too."
