OL,6,FThe Welsh Government says the spike in
OL,7,Fheritage crime has left ancient sites
OL,8,Fdamaged, conservation work delayed,
OL,9,Fand public access restricted.
OL,11,FCulture Minister Jack Sargeant
OL,12,Fdescribed the growing problem as an
OL,13,F'assault on national identity'.
OL,15,FHe said: "Heritage crime is more than
OL,16,Fvandalism ` it's a loss of our
OL,17,Fhistory. But reporting it can help
OL,18,Fprotect Wales's past for future
OL,19,Fgenerations so I would urge the public
OL,20,Fto be watchful."
