OL,7,F- who is a retired Swansea University

OL,9,Fafter winning at the Blaenau Gwent and
OL,10,FValleys National Eisteddfod in 2010.
OL,12,FHowever despite his win, Mr Hallam
OL,13,Fsaid that he was initially unsure

OL,16,Finitial treatment to manage the cancer
OL,17,Fhad been unsuccessful.

OL,6,FHe said: "I was in two minds as to
OL,7,Fwhether to present the poem because I
OL,8,Fdidn't know at that time if I'd be
OL,9,Fhere in August, I wasn't sure how much
OL,10,Ftime I had.
OL,12,F"I had the diagnosis in August (2024)
OL,13,Fand for some reason I wasn't able to
OL,14,Fwrite anything in Welsh, in my mother
OL,15,Ftongue And then in January I had the
OL,16,Fsad news that the treatment that was
OL,17,Fsupposed to buy me some time had not
OL,18,Fworked at all and in that anguish I
OL,19,Fsuddenly began to write, and the poem
OL,20,Fjust flowed out of me."
