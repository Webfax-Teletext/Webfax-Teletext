OL,6,FA Conwy dad-of-three was shocked to
OL,7,Fsee a baby gecko drop from a bag of
OL,8,Fchillies he bought from a supermarket,
OL,9,Fand fall onto his kitchen work
OL,10,Fsurface.JKevin Cuthbert purchased the
OL,11,Fred-hot Scotch bonnet chillies from an
OL,12,FAsda Superstore in Llandudno a week
OL,13,Fearlier.
OL,15,FHe said: "When I found the gecko, it
OL,16,Fwas missing its tail - it must have
OL,17,Fshed it when it was being packed.
OL,19,F"After a couple of days, I noticed it
OL,20,Fwas growing back, so I thought there
OL,21,Fwas a chance it might survive."

OL,6,FThe family were determined to keep the

OL,10,Falways asking for a pet ` a dog or
OL,11,Fsomething ` and I've always said no.
OL,12,FThen all of a sudden, one drops onto

OL,14,FInquiries at the Welsh Mountain Zoo,

OL,16,Fto be a Crocodile Gecko, also known as
OL,17,Fa Moorish Gecko.

OL,12,Fsaid: "The tub with Scotty is still in
