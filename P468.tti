OL,8,Fin photography was first ignited when
OL,9,Fhe was in the Army.
OL,11,F"I saw a picture in a magazine called
OL,12,FPicture Post, which was a Russian army
OL,13,Fofficer buying his wife a hat in a
OL,14,Fdepartment store in Moscow," he said.
OL,16,F"It made me cry, because my father had
OL,17,Fbeen away during the Second World War,
OL,18,Fand the first thing he did when he
OL,19,Freturned to the UK was take my mother
