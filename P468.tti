OL,3,CCopper could be mined on Anglesey again
OL,5,FHe said the new application was aimed
OL,6,Fat reassuring local people that any
OL,7,Fnew mining would be carried out with
OL,8,Fminimal impact on the environment.
OL,10,FHowever, it would involve significant
OL,11,Fsurface works, including a processing
OL,12,Fplant to extract metals from the rock,
OL,13,Fventilation shafts and storage areas
OL,14,Ffor the tailings and other waste.
OL,16,FMr Marsden added: "Copper, zinc,
OL,17,Fsilver and lead are essential metals
OL,18,Ffor the UK's energy transition towards
OL,19,Felectricity and away from fossil
