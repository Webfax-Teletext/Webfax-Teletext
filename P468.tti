OL,7,FScaling a drainpipe with sandbags in

OL,9,Fcaused by an incendiary bomb. Despite

OL,11,Fwent officially unrecognised
OL,13,FNow, on his 100th birthday, Mr
OL,14,FBrignall has received overdue
OL,15,Frecognition. The Lord Mayor of
OL,16,FCardiff, Cllr Bablin Molik, personally
OL,17,Fpresented him with a special
OL,18,Fcertificate, acknowledging his valour
OL,19,Fand preserving the events of that

OL,7,FReflecting on his actions, Mr Brignall
OL,8,Frecalled his motivation to protect
OL,9,FCity Hall, stating: "I was only a
OL,10,Fteenager, and I didn't have any fear.
OL,11,FI just wanted to make sure the bomb
OL,12,Fdidn't do any damage."
OL,14,FDriven to contribute further to the
OL,15,Fwar effort, Mr Brignall served as an
OL,16,Fofficial fire-watcher and later joined
OL,17,Fthe RAF, participating in crucial
OL,18,Foperations like Operation Varsity in
OL,19,F1945.

OL,7,FDespite his remarkable courage, Mr
OL,8,FBrignall's only concern at the time
OL,9,Fwas a sore jaw and a ruined suit from
OL,10,Fcarrying sandbags up the roof.
OL,12,FMr Brignall's son Ian said: "He's
OL,13,Falways been a modest man and rarely
OL,14,Ftalked about his warJrecord. We only
OL,15,Fknew of his heroics in Cardiff on that
OL,16,Fday because he'd kept some newspaper
OL,17,Fcuttings from the time."

OL,8,Fas you'd expect from someone who is

OL,17,Fbut it is no less heartfelt and I
