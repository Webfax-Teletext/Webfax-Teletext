OL,6,FA Gower farmer has "had enough" after
OL,7,Flosing 20 lambs last year due to dog
OL,8,Fattacks on Rhosili cliffs.
OL,10,FNicky Beynon told ITV News he has had
OL,11,Fto move his ewes and lambs over fears
OL,12,Fof irresponsible dog walking which has
OL,13,Flead to the injury or even deaths of
OL,14,Fhis farm animals.
OL,16,FHe said: "Between me and my Uncle
OL,17,FGeoff, we would have had around 300
OL,18,Fsheep lambing on Rhosili Cliffs, and
OL,19,Fthis year there'll be none.

OL,12,FMr Beynon has also had to move his

OL,16,FHe added: "Everyone's answer to the
