OL,13,FIn his first interview since taking on

OL,7,FThe new scheme is designed to make the
OL,8,Findustry greener by requiring farmers
OL,9,Fto plant 10% of their land with trees
OL,10,Fand use another 10% as wildlife
OL,11,Fhabitat to qualify for subsidies.
OL,13,FHowever, many farmers are strongly
OL,14,Fopposed to the policy, arguing it
OL,15,Fcould result in lower food production

OL,18,FFarmers' unhappiness with the plans
