OL,7,FITV Wales spent the morning with
OL,8,FTracy, a nurse who does her rounds on
OL,9,Fthe streets of Bridgend rather than
OL,10,Fthe traditional hospital ward.
OL,12,FShe told ITV Wales: "I just feel this
OL,13,Fpatient group should have the same
OL,14,Fcare as everyone else and I'm not
OL,15,Fsaying that they don't ` but they
OL,16,Fdon't engage, so sometimes it's about

OL,18,Ftake away the stigma and get them to
OL,19,Ftrust us."
