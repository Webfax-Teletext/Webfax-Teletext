OL,11,Fconsidered negligible.

OL,6,FMr Crowson continues: "A document like
OL,7,Fthis really brings home the suffering
OL,8,Fof the Channel Islanders during the
OL,9,FGerman Occupation, some 2,300 of whom
OL,10,Fwere deported to German prison and
OL,11,Finternment camps. By the time of the
OL,12,FLiberation in 1945, many were close to

OL,15,F"The essential role played by the men
OL,16,Fand women involved in Operation
OL,17,FNestegg, and their story of freedom,
OL,18,Fcannot be underestimated. And the fact
OL,19,Fthat the document came to light in the

OL,21,FDay makes it even more special."
