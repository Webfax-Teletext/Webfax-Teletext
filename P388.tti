OL,13,Fscreenings are offered to those aged

OL,17,FThe screening checks the back of the

OL,19,Fretinopathy, which is treatable if

OL,6,FDr Nigel Minihane explained: "The
OL,7,Fcurrent situation is that everyone
OL,8,Freferred to the diabetic service has
OL,9,Fgiven implicit consent to share data,
OL,10,Fso they are being contacted directly,
OL,11,Ffor retinal screening to prevent
OL,12,Fblindness.
OL,14,F"The diabetic service is unaware of
OL,15,Fthose people who are looked after
OL,16,Fsolely in general practice, so we want
OL,17,Fto make that service aware of those
OL,18,Fpatients so they can be contacted for
OL,19,Fscreening."
