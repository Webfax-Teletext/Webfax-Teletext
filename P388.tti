OL,6,FJersey's Civil Service has made "good
OL,7,Fprogress" on combatting harassment and
OL,8,Fbullying with further space for
OL,9,Fimprovement, according to a new report.
OL,11,FThe review by UK consulting company HR
OL,12,FLounge found that behaviour in the
OL,13,FStates' public bodies had improved,
OL,14,Ffollowing a previously damning
OL,15,Fassessment from 2018.
OL,17,FThat report cited the States had "a
OL,18,Flevel of bullying and harassment
OL,19,Fcomplaints that is significant".
