OL,8,FOfficer, Ruari Hardy, has found he did
OL,9,Fnot provide false information to
OL,10,Fmislead the Royal Court.
OL,12,FIt comes after a complaint was made in
OL,13,FDecember 2023, alleging that Hardy
OL,14,Fknowingly provided false information
OL,15,Funder oath in an attempt to mislead
OL,16,Fthe Guernsey Royal Court.
OL,18,FThis was during an appeal against
