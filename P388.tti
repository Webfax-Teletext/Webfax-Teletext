OL,6,FBrittany Ferries has submitted its

OL,14,Fshould their bid be successful.

OL,6,FWhat was previously meant to be a
OL,7,Fjoint tender process from both
OL,8,FBailiwicks broke apart as Guernsey

OL,11,Fwhile Jersey struggled to reach a

OL,14,FBrittany Ferries says they resubmitted
OL,15,Ftheir bid following "reassuring
OL,16,Fcomments" from Jersey Ministers that
OL,17,Findependent assessors would examine

OL,6,FThe company also reiterated that it

OL,11,FChristophe Mathieu, CEO of Condor and
OL,12,FBrittany Ferries, says: "There will be
OL,13,Fno volte-face on things like minimum
OL,14,Fservice levels or pricing, should an

OL,17,FHe also explains that while previous
