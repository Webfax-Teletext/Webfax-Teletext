OL,6,FIn the review's introduction, AECOM
OL,7,Fexplain: "The States of Guernsey are
OL,8,Ffacing increasing challenges around
OL,9,Fthe prevention, education and
OL,10,Fenforcement of road traffic and driver
OL,11,Foffences across the islands and are
OL,12,Flooking for recommendations."
OL,14,FThere are a total of 11 suggestions
OL,15,Ffor change - some are already in force
OL,16,For being implemented: data assessment,
OL,17,Fnoisy vehicles legislation, new
OL,18,Fmeasures for minimum standards, and
OL,19,Fdashcams in police vehicles.

OL,11,FOne of the suggestions not yet
