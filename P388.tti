OL,7,Fsuspended from practising law for 12
OL,8,Fmonths after he crashed into an

OL,12,Finvolved in the incident on 16 May
OL,13,F2025, where, instead of stopping after
OL,14,Fthe accident, he left the scene and
OL,15,Fcontinued to drive his vehicle, which
OL,16,Fwas described as "significantly
OL,17,Fdamaged and unroadworthy" by jurats.

OL,6,F"We feel that the appropriate penalty,
OL,7,Fwhich for a professional at his stage
OL,8,Fof career is hard indeed, is a
OL,9,Fsuspension from practice for the
OL,10,Fmaximum period possible, to commence
OL,11,Ffrom the date of his release from
OL,12,Fprison," the judgment reads.
OL,14,FIn their ruling, the jurats and the
OL,15,FCommissioner also took into account a
OL,16,Fprevious offence where Steenson had
OL,17,Fassaulted a taxi driver while drunk.
OL,19,FAt the time, Steenson was suspended
OL,20,Ffrom practising law in the island for
OL,21,Fthree months.

OL,6,F"It is rightly observed that the
