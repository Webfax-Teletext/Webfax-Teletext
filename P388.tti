OL,11,FGrant Hardy says they checked their
OL,12,Fdocuments were valid for their holiday
OL,13,Fto Tenerife, but he was refused travel
OL,14,Fdue to concerns over his passport's
OL,15,Fvalidity.
OL,17,FThey now want compensation for their

OL,6,FGrant explains: "The rules aren't
OL,7,Fdifficult to interpret which makes it
OL,8,Feven more frustrating and they have
OL,9,Fbeen in place for some time, so I
OL,10,Fdon't see how anybody in a position of

OL,13,Fwrong.
OL,15,F"This is likely to affect other

OL,12,FThe confusion may have come from the
