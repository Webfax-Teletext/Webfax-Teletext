OL,6,FThe gender pay gap between men and

OL,8,Fpublic sector since 2022, according to
OL,9,FJersey's Gender Pay Gap Report 2025,
OL,10,Fwhich was released yesterday.
OL,12,FThe report found that last year, women
OL,13,Fearned on average 92.2 pence per hour
OL,14,Ffor every pound than men did.
OL,16,FIt comes as figures show two-thirds of
OL,17,Fthe current workforce are female.
