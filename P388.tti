OL,8,Ffrom 2025.
OL,10,FDeputy Sir Philip Bailhache is looking

OL,12,Fintroduction of French-English
OL,13,Fbilingual lessons in three schools,

OL,16,FHe says the changes would bring

OL,18,Fadvantages, as well as cultural and
OL,19,Fheritage benefits, given the island's
OL,20,Fhistorical ties to France.
