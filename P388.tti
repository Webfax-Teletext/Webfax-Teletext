OL,6,FThe States of Guernsey's top political
OL,7,Fcommittee is pushing to confirm new
OL,8,Fplans to upgrade Alderney's runway
OL,9,Fnext month.
OL,11,FThere has been frustration amongst
OL,12,FAlderney residents and politicians
OL,13,Fover the deteriorating runway that is
OL,14,Fcurrently covered with a patchwork of
OL,15,Ftemporary repairs.
OL,17,FThere have been constant calls for a
OL,18,Ffull refurbishment to be urgently
OL,19,Fprioritised, following concerns over
OL,20,Ftravel links and delays to Guernsey.

OL,11,FThese new proposals - earmarked for a

OL,13,Fsee the runway widened from 18 to 23
