OL,6,FFor the last 20 years, Jersey's La
OL,7,FFolie Inn has remained closed and
OL,8,Fderelict - and there has been much
OL,9,Fspeculation as to what might happen to
OL,10,Fit.
OL,12,FThe idea of 'heritage style' visitor
OL,13,Faccommodation, an 'upmarket
OL,14,Frestaurant', and a 'maritime
OL,15,Fattraction' have all been suggested,
OL,16,Fbut nothing has happened.

OL,12,FChris told ITV: "It was a bit crazy
