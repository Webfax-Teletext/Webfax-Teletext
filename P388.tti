OL,6,FJersey's External Relations Minister,

OL,11,F"We currently have no intention of

OL,6,FThe controversy focuses on the use of
OL,7,Fwhat's called a 'permissive extent
OL,8,Fclause'. These are effectively used as
OL,9,Fa simple mechanism when the Crown
OL,10,FDependencies want a bit of UK
OL,11,Flegislation to apply to them.
OL,13,FBut the key point is that they have to
OL,14,Fbe asked before that happens.
OL,16,FThe Ministry of Justice's own
OL,17,Fdocuments make it very clear that UK
OL,18,Flegislation "should not be extended
OL,19,Fwithout first consulting the Islands'

OL,6,FThat appears not to have happened in

OL,10,FThe reality is it is unlikely to have

OL,14,FThis is in many ways a matter of
