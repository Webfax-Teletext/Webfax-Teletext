OL,6,FJersey's Planning Committee has voted
OL,7,Funanimously against converting the
OL,8,Fformer Nude Dunes restaurant into a
OL,9,Fself-catering accommodation.
OL,11,FIt comes after the new building owner,
OL,12,FNadia Millar asked for the planning
OL,13,Fdepartment's approval to change the
OL,14,Fbuilding's use.
OL,16,FThe planning application stated it
OL,17,Fwanted a "partial change of use from
OL,18,FCafe or Restaurant to a two-bedroom
OL,19,Fself-catering holiday accommodation".

OL,9,FChair of the Committee, Connetable
OL,10,FPhilip Le Sueur, outlined his concerns
OL,11,Fabout the "detrimental impact on the

OL,14,FThe committee also expressed
OL,15,Fapprehensions over the economic
OL,16,Fviability of converting the site's use
OL,17,Fafter Nadia expressed that the
OL,18,Frestaurant was not viable at La

OL,9,Feconomically viable.
OL,11,FThe former restaurant closed on

OL,13,Fwriting on social media: "We have done
