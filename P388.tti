OL,8,Fthat is on the loose in Jersey.
OL,10,FThe ferret-like creature, also known
OL,11,Fas a beech marten, is not native to
OL,12,Fthe island but is commonly seen in
OL,13,Fnearby France.
OL,15,FAlthough it has a partly plant-based
OL,16,Fdiet, particularly in the summer

OL,18,Fkill and eat small mammals such as
OL,19,Fbirds, rabbits and hares.

OL,6,FCris Sellares from Jersey's National
OL,7,FTrust says: "It was seen in a garden
OL,8,Fnear the St Peters Coop early June. A
OL,9,Ffew days later it was found in a
OL,10,Fnearby garden having killed a pet
OL,11,Fguinea pig inside its hutch.
OL,13,F"Given its tameness, it is highly
OL,14,Funlikely that it arrived in Jersey of
OL,15,Fits own accord. It is believed that
OL,16,Fit, or its parents, belong to someone
OL,17,Fand that it has escaped or been
OL,18,Freleased. Efforts have been made to
OL,19,Ftrap it without success."
