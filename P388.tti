OL,10,FThe mammals interact through clicking

OL,15,FJersey marine expert Dr Paul Chambers
OL,16,Fsays the noises that dolphins make in
OL,17,Fthe Channel Islands sound different to
OL,18,Fthose in other parts of the world,
OL,19,Falthough human ears are unlikely to be

OL,6,FHe explains: "One of the funny things
OL,7,Fis that dolphins seem to have regional
OL,8,Faccents.
OL,10,F"The same dolphin species in different
OL,11,Fparts of the world produce clicks
OL,12,Fwhich have different frequencies,
OL,13,Fdurations and gaps. For example,
OL,14,Fbottlenose dolphins in Tenerife, the
OL,15,FAzores, South Wales and Jersey all

OL,17,Feach other.

OL,6,F"Just as regional isolation in humans
OL,7,Fproduces different speech accents, the
OL,8,Fsame is true for dolphins and
OL,9,Fporpoises."
OL,11,FMarine experts use devices called
OL,12,Fhydrophones to detect where dolphins
OL,13,Fare and the noises they make.
OL,15,FDr Chambers says: "The noises are
OL,16,Fproduced by an organ in the head and
OL,17,Fwork in the same way as bat
OL,18,Fecholocation, a click or pulse is
OL,19,Ffired out by the animal, it bounces
OL,20,Foff something and comes back."

OL,6,FMost sounds are beyond the human
OL,7,Fhearing range so technology is needed
OL,8,Fto analyse them.
OL,10,FDolphin populations often live in
OL,11,Fsmall geographical areas so their
OL,12,Fsounds can vary between environments,
OL,13,Fsimilar to how people in different
OL,14,Fareas develop separate accents, even

OL,17,FDr Chambers says bottlenose dolphins
OL,18,Fare the most common species in and

OL,20,Faround 400 to 450 of them living in
