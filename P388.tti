OL,7,FWith the school summer holidays in

OL,10,FWell, the signs are good - August is
OL,11,Ftypically a warm month and tends to be
OL,12,Four hottest time of the year, with an
OL,13,Faverage daily temperature of 18.4C.
OL,15,FThis is because it takes time for the
OL,16,FEarth's surface to fully heat up after
OL,17,Fthe sun is at its strongest in June.
OL,19,FWith shorter nights than days, there
OL,20,Fis more time for the earth to warm
OL,21,Fthan there is for it to cool.
