OL,13,Fconfidence has been knocked and they
OL,14,Foften feel alone.

OL,17,Flosing her hearing and says it is:
OL,18,F"Very very isolating. I couldn't

OL,6,F"I had an app on my iPhone and iPad
OL,7,Fwhich took speech to text and that's

OL,10,Fyou're in a noisy environment. So

OL,6,FShe says: "You know they can save a
OL,7,Flife. There are so many people with
OL,8,Fhearing loss who feel so isolated
OL,9,Fbecause they miss out on so much in
OL,10,Fconversation. I know what it feels
OL,11,Flike but I'm quite an expert lipreader
OL,12,Fbut for someone who lost their hearing
OL,13,Fthat's a different ballgame."
OL,15,FPaul Daniel says: "It's developing a
OL,16,Fskill it's going to take ages but it
OL,17,Fis helping already. It is so hard to
OL,18,Fconcentrate on someone's mouth, we're
OL,19,Fexhausted after these lessons
OL,20,Fhonestly."
