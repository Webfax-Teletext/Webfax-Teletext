OL,6,FBen explains: "We are deaf parents. We
OL,7,Fhave two children who are hearing, My
OL,8,Fson Oliver signs a little bit and they
OL,9,Fneed to learn sign language because
OL,10,Fit's our home language."
OL,12,FWhat does 'dDeaf' mean?
OL,14,F'dDeaf' is a shorthand term for people
OL,15,Fwho are 'deaf' (diagnosed with hearing
OL,16,Fbelow the normal level) as well as
OL,17,Fmedically 'Deaf' (diagnosed with the
OL,18,Fcondition of deafness).

OL,6,FSome organisations that support or
OL,7,Fprovide services for deaf people or
OL,8,Fpeople with hearing issues prefer to
OL,9,Fuse 'dDeaf' to show they support a
OL,10,Fwide range of hearing needs.
OL,12,FKaren adds: "Events like these are
OL,13,Falso worth it for the deaf community.
OL,14,FIt's good for children to learn the
OL,15,Fnumbers and bingo in a community event.
OL,17,F"We want more and more people to come
OL,18,F- especially other deaf people. Next
OL,19,Ftime we will try and invite more
OL,20,Fpeople which would be good for them."
