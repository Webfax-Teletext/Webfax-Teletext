OL,8,Fcoming into bloom - March has arrived.
OL,10,FIt is a transitional month, sandwiched
OL,11,Fbetween winter and spring.
OL,13,FAs such, it can be one of the most
OL,14,Fvaried months for our weather and
OL,15,Fespecially our temperatures.
OL,17,FFor example, the lowest maximum
OL,18,Fdaytime temperature recorded was below
OL,19,Ffreezing at -0.1C on 9 March 1934,
OL,20,Fwhile the highest was 22.9C on 30

OL,6,FThis goes some way to explaining the
OL,7,FMarch weather proverb 'in like a lion,
OL,8,Fout like a lamb': it can begin on a
OL,9,Fwet, windy and cool note, but tends to
OL,10,Fwarm up and become more settled.
OL,12,FSo what trends can we look out for?
OL,14,FAlthough not always the case,
OL,15,Ftemperatures tend to increase
OL,16,Fgradually throughout the month as the
OL,17,Fdays become longer and the sun rises
OL,18,Fhigher in the sky.
