OL,7,Fa fertilised egg grows outside of the
OL,8,Fwomb, usually in the fallopian tubes,
OL,9,Fand can need immediate medical
OL,10,Fintervention.
OL,12,FRecalling her experience, Sarah says
OL,13,Fshe was bleeding and in pain, crying
OL,14,Fout in A&E: "Please don't make me wait
OL,15,Ffor three hours, I think I'm losing my

OL,18,FShe was then made a priority but still
OL,19,Fhad to wait 30 to 45 minutes.

OL,6,FWhen Sarah was seen, she says the care
OL,7,Fshe received was dismissive: "She (the
OL,8,Fdoctor) asked to see my sanitary pad
OL,9,Fbut because there wasn't a lot of

OL,14,FSarah asked to see a gynaecologist but

OL,16,Fand was sent home.
