OL,6,FJersey's Housing Minister believes
OL,7,Fpotentially hundreds of local
OL,8,Flandlords are breaking the law by not
OL,9,Fputting deposits into an approved and
OL,10,Findependent tenancy scheme.
OL,12,FDeputy Sam Mezec wants the rules to be
OL,13,Fenforced as they have been in place
OL,14,Fsince 2015 with fines of up to #10,000
OL,15,Ffor those who do not comply, but it
OL,16,Fdoes not seem like anyone has ever
OL,17,Fbeen prosecuted.
