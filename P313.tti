OL,6,FBritish actor Tom Hollander is often
OL,7,Fmistaken for Spider-Man star Tom
OL,8,FHolland on paper, but rarely would
OL,9,Fsuch a mistake result in a seven-
OL,10,Ffigure sum being deposited into your
OL,11,Fbank account.
OL,13,FBut that is exactly what happened to
OL,14,FThe White Lotus actor Tom Hollander
OL,15,Fwhen the agency representing both
OL,16,Factors mixed the pair up via email.
OL,18,FSpeaking to Late Night host Seth
OL,19,FMeyers, the actor said: "We were with
OL,20,Fthe same agents briefly and people in
OL,21,Fthe accounts department got confused.

OL,10,FThe mistaken bonus payslip was

OL,17,Ffor #30,000 or something which was
OL,18,Fgoing to get me through the next year

OL,10,F"It was an astonishing amount of
