OL,6,FThe storm season is officially

OL,8,Ffirst named storm of the season, which
OL,9,Fwill hit the UK later this week.
OL,11,FStorm Amy is a powerful mid-Atlantic

OL,13,Fremains of Hurricane Humberto and will
OL,14,Fbring wet and windy weather to the

OL,6,FAs it tracks across north-eastwards
OL,7,Ftowards the UK and its subtropical
OL,8,Fwarm air mass passes over the

OL,3,CStorm Amy: Where and when will the

OL,6,FQuite often, we see former hurricanes
OL,7,Fand tropical storms weaken as they
OL,8,Ftravel from the US or Caribbean,
OL,9,Facross the Atlantic, resulting in
OL,10,Fheavy rain and strong, damaging winds
OL,11,F- or we see deep areas of low pressure
OL,12,Fform in the mid-Atlantic and bring
OL,13,Fstormy conditions to our shores.
OL,15,FIn this scenario, we're seeing a
OL,16,Fcombination of the two, which is a
OL,17,Flittle more rare.
