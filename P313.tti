OL,9,Fsmiles and chats with so much charm
OL,10,Fand charisma that you'd never have
OL,11,Fguessed it.
OL,13,FHis leather jacket, glittered cheeks
OL,14,Fand heavily ripped jeans have somehow
OL,15,Fmade me feel both underdressed and
OL,16,Foverdressed at the same time.

OL,12,FReflecting on her support and advice,
OL,13,FFrankie said: "She's been unbelievable
