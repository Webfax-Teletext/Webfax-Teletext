OL,8,FRory McIlroy has worked his whole life
OL,9,Ftowards claiming a career grand slam,
OL,10,Fdescribing it as a "dream come true".
OL,12,FHe had plenty of practice last year,
OL,13,Ftaking on 27 tournaments - but could
OL,14,Fsecuring his fifth major title be down
OL,15,Fto his mental game?
OL,17,FMcIlroy has known his sports
OL,18,Fpsychologist, Bob Rotella, since 2010,
OL,19,Fwith the pair's relationship
OL,20,Fintensifying in the lead-up to his US

OL,9,Fthan "getting too much into results

OL,6,FAdam Nicholls, Professor in Sports

OL,8,Fsaid those repeated losses would have

OL,11,FHe told ITV News: "It can have a

OL,6,F"It can also have a knock-on effect in
OL,7,Fterms of low mood and also their
OL,8,Fmotivation. And that's why a lot of
OL,9,Fathletes don't have the sustained
OL,10,Fcareers that the very best athletes do
OL,11,Fbecause they probably struggle to cope
OL,12,Fwith the setbacks."
OL,14,FProfessor Nicholls added: "This tells

OL,9,FHis losses were made even more painful
OL,10,Fby close finishes, notably in the 2024

OL,6,F"When golfers feel under pressure they
