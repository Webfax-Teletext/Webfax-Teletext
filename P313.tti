OL,8,Fnational income) and a lot more money
OL,9,Ffor health, along with a commitment to
OL,10,Feliminate the NHS waiting list
OL,11,Faltogether - something that has never

OL,14,FThe tax cuts are eye-catching. Reform
OL,15,Fsays it would take 7 million people
OL,16,Fout of paying income tax by raising
OL,17,Fthe threshold to #20,000 a year.
