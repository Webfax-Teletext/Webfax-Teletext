OL,6,FIn the week of Labour's party
OL,7,Fconference, Nigel Farage has once
OL,8,Fagain pulled the spotlight onto
OL,9,Fmigration.
OL,11,FThe Reform UK leader announced that
OL,12,Fhis party would scrap indefinite leave
OL,13,Fto remain (ILR), the legal status that
OL,14,Fallows migrants to settle permanently
OL,15,Fin Britain, if it were to win power at
OL,16,Fthe next general election.
OL,18,FWith an election a long while away and
OL,19,Fwith only a handful of MPs, Reform UK
OL,20,Fare some distance from achieving this
OL,21,Fpitch to the British public.

OL,6,FILR is currently the main route to
OL,7,Fcitizenship, with tens of thousands of
OL,8,Fpeople using it to secure British
OL,9,Fcitizenship. Barring EU citizens with
OL,10,Fsettled status, Reform's plan would
OL,11,Fretroactively apply new rules to those

OL,6,FThen there's the economic
OL,7,Fimplications. Social care, hospitality
OL,8,Fand other lower-paid sectors rely
