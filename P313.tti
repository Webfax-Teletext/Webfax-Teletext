OL,12,Fto set out a 2p cut in National

OL,17,Fstressed his commitment to ending the

OL,6,FThe aspiration to end the double

OL,9,Fpromise by Labour, which pointed out

OL,15,Fit's written on unless accompanied by
OL,16,Fsome sense of how it will be funded".
OL,17,FHowever, Mr Sunak said: "We've cut
OL,18,FNICs by a third in two events over six
OL,19,Fmonths. So that demonstrates we are
OL,20,Fdelivering and we can go further,
OL,21,Fthough it's important that we stick to
OL,22,Fthe plan and then we can make
OL,23,Fsignificant progress towards that goal
