OL,10,FThe cooler temperatures mean that the

OL,12,Fdrier air results in bolder looking
OL,13,Fcolours.
OL,15,FDuring winter, the sun sets on more of

OL,8,Fsaid: "A good amount of mid and high
OL,9,Flevel cloud in the sky, a 40-70%
OL,10,Fcoverage of the sky is a good amount,
OL,11,Fis also required to help capture the

OL,13,Fdeeper colour.
OL,15,F"The clouds to look out for in
OL,16,Fparticular are firstly, cirrus clouds.
OL,17,FThese are high, thick clouds made of
OL,18,Fice crystals. They often form ahead of
OL,19,Fan approaching warm front."
