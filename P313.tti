OL,7,FThe risk of a newly discovered

OL,10,Fhighest-ever impact probability for
OL,11,Fits size.

OL,14,Fchance of colliding with Earth in
OL,15,FDecember 2032, down from 3.1%, the
OL,16,Fagency said.
OL,18,FHowever, the European Space Agency
OL,19,F(ESA) has slightly different odds
OL,20,Fsaying there is a 2.2% likelihood of a
OL,21,Fcollision in seven years' time.
