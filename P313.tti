OL,6,FKate's office will not say what cancer
OL,7,Fshe has and sources indicate that each

OL,9,Fnews and that the Princess has an

OL,12,FThe added complication here is William
OL,13,Fand Kate's three young children, and
OL,14,Fthe couple had to work out when was
OL,15,Fbest to tell them.
OL,17,FIt's understood that the children have

OL,6,FIt also took time for Kate and William
OL,7,Fto come to terms with the diagnosis,
OL,8,Fas well as time for her to recover
OL,9,Ffrom her other operation so she could

OL,6,FThe cancer was not discovered when she
