OL,6,FA former MSP who quit Holyrood for
OL,7,FWestminster has urged the Scottish
OL,8,FParliament to "up its game".
OL,10,FFormer Scottish secretary David
OL,11,FMundell insisted that Holyrood "still
OL,12,Fhas the capacity to be a force for
OL,13,Fgood right across Scotland".
OL,15,FBut he claimed while Holyrood's
OL,16,Fcommittees had previously been
OL,17,F"lauded" for their work, Westminster's
OL,18,Fcommittees were now "more effective",
OL,19,Fsaying this was in part due to their
OL,20,Fsystem of electing committee chairs.
