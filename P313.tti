OL,8,FCollege of Cardinals - the group who

OL,11,FCardinals are senior members of the
OL,12,Fclergy, many of whom are bishops and
OL,13,Farchbishops appointed by the pope.
OL,15,FThe rules of the conclave state that
OL,16,Fthere are 138 electors - and therefore
OL,17,F138 eligible papal candidates - of the
OL,18,F252 cardinals.
OL,20,FOnly those under the age of 80 may
