OL,3,CWhy Tory outrage about the Chagos

OL,6,FThe point is that the transfer was
OL,7,Fbeing negotiated on the recent Tory
OL,8,Fgovernment's watch - including by
OL,9,FCleverly as foreign secretary and then
OL,10,Fby Cameron - and the deadline was set
OL,11,Fby Washington.
OL,13,FThe material fact is that President
OL,14,FBiden wanted the deal done before the
OL,15,FNovember 5 presidential election.
OL,16,FBiden wanted certainty about the
OL,17,Ffuture of the US military base on the
OL,18,FChagossian island of Diego Garcia,
OL,19,Fjust in case Donald Trump were to win

OL,8,FJohnson was the last PM to wholly

OL,13,FIf anyone in the Tory party wants to
OL,14,Fknow the nitty-gritty of all this,
OL,15,Fpossibly they could ask for an
OL,16,Fintroduction from the former minister
