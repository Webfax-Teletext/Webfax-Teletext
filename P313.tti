OL,6,FIn the hours following her son
OL,7,FRobert's death, Dawn Turner found the
OL,8,Fstrength to take to social media and
OL,9,Fpost a cry from the heart: "He was a
OL,10,Fveteran. He served his country and he
OL,11,Fwas failed. Failed while he lived and
OL,12,Fhe is still being failed now in death."
OL,14,FRobert Homans, 35, served ten years in
OL,15,Fthe Royal Horse Artillery and
OL,16,Fcompleted two tours of Afghanistan. He
OL,17,Fwas promoted to Bombardier and
OL,18,Fexcelled at sports, but on leaving the
OL,19,Farmy, he began to struggle. His
OL,20,Fmarriage failed, and he became
