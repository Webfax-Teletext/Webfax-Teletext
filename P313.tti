OL,6,FThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has
OL,7,Fjust told my colleague Joel that if -
OL,8,Fas expected - she increases what
OL,9,Femployers pay to the government in
OL,10,Fnational insurance that would be
OL,11,Fconsistent with the Labour Party's
OL,12,Fmanifesto promise not to "increase
OL,13,Fnational insurance".
OL,15,FRachel Reeves's argument is that the
OL,16,Fparty meant only the national
OL,17,Finsurance paid directly by employees,
OL,18,Fnot the national insurance that
OL,19,Femployers are obliged to pay on behalf
OL,20,Fof their staff.

OL,6,FShe implies that we should all have
OL,7,Fbeen prepared for a possible rise in
OL,8,Femployers' NI because the manifesto
OL,9,Fqualifies its pledge not to increase

OL,14,FIn other words, Reeves is insisting
OL,15,Fthat we should all have known that
OL,16,Fincreasing employers' contributions
OL,17,Fcould be on its way under a Labour
OL,18,Fgovernment because - on her definition
