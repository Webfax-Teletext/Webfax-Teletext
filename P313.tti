OL,6,FScientists have confirmed a cave on
OL,7,Fthe moon, not far from where Neil
OL,8,FArmstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55
OL,9,Fyears ago, and suspect there are
OL,10,Fhundreds more that could house future
OL,11,Fastronauts.
OL,13,FAn Italian-led team reported on Monday
OL,14,Fthat there's evidence for a sizable
OL,15,Fcave accessible from the deepest known
OL,16,Fpit on the moon.
OL,18,FIt's located at the Sea of
OL,19,FTranquility, just 250 miles (400
OL,20,Fkilometers) from Apollo 11's landing
OL,21,Fsite.

OL,6,FThe radar data reveals only the
