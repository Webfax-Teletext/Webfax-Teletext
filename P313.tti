OL,7,FThere are two reasons why teachers'
OL,8,Funions are deeply unhappy at the
OL,9,Fgovernment's recommendation to the
OL,10,Fstatutory review body, and is that
OL,11,Fthis year's pay settlement should be
OL,12,F2.8%.
OL,14,FThe first is that it will probably
OL,15,Fmean teachers' pay lagging private
OL,16,Fsector pay for something like the 15th
OL,17,Fconsecutive year, and will not make
OL,18,Fgood the inflationary erosion of the
