OL,6,FSpeaking to Big Issue, Sir Brian said:
OL,7,F"Freddie is still alive through the

OL,10,F"In a sense, John is still with us in
OL,11,Fthe same way, but now we have so many
OL,12,Fother opportunities. I mean things
OL,13,Fthat are immersive, like The Sphere in
OL,14,FLas Vegas, it will be possible to give
OL,15,Fpeople the experience very closely of
OL,16,Fwhat things were like for us when we
OL,17,Fwere Freddie, John, Brian and Roger,
OL,18,Fand that really appeals to me.
