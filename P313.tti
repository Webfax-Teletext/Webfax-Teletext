OL,12,FWhat is the Taurid meteor shower?
OL,14,FMost meteor showers are formed from
OL,15,Fthe debris of comets. The Taurids are
OL,16,Fmade up of rubble from a comet called
OL,17,FEncke.

OL,7,FWhen the rocks enter Earth's
OL,8,Fatmosphere, they become heated up by
OL,9,Fair resistance which makes them glow
OL,10,Fand gives them a fiery tail,
OL,11,Frecognisable as the end of a shooting
OL,12,Fstar.
OL,14,FThey vary in size from dust particles
OL,15,Fto boulders and are often very bright
OL,16,Ffireballs.
OL,18,FThe space debris from Encke makes up
OL,19,Ftwo separate Taurid meteor showers -
OL,20,Fthe Southern Taurids, and the Northern
OL,21,FTaurids.

OL,12,FThey cross the sky at about 17 miles
OL,13,F(27km) per second, which is slower in
OL,14,Fcomparison to other showers. For
OL,15,Fexample, Perseids meteor move at
OL,16,Fdouble the speed.
