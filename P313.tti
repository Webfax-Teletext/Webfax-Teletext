OL,8,FElon Musk has announced the arrival of
OL,9,FGrok 4, the latest model of his
OL,10,Fartificial intelligence chatbot, which
OL,11,Fhas been marred by controversy since

OL,14,FThe latest instalment was launched in
OL,15,Fthe same week that Grok received
OL,16,Fwidespread criticism for antisemitic
OL,17,Fcomments, posted on Musk's social
OL,18,Fmedia platform X.
