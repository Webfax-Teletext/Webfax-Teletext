OL,3,CLEGO fans divided by new 'smart' bricks
OL,5,FLEGO has launched 'smart' bricks,
OL,6,Fwhich are tech-filled versions of
OL,7,Ftheir normal building blocks, but fans
OL,8,Fare divided as to whether it's a good
OL,9,Fidea.
OL,11,FThere are three parts of the new
OL,12,Fsystem that work together - the smart
OL,13,Fbrick, smart tags which tell the brick
OL,14,Fwhat to do, and smart minifigures,
OL,15,Fwhich react to their environment with
OL,16,Fsounds, moods and reactions.

OL,5,FLEGO has called the new system its
OL,6,F"most revolutionary innovation since
OL,7,Fthe creation of the minifigure in
OL,8,F1978", saying it should "help (LEGO)
OL,9,Fplay back with you".
OL,11,FBut LEGO fans have had mixed responses

OL,5,FLEGO content creator @emmasaurus wrote
OL,6,Fthat the new bricks were "exciting",
OL,7,Fbut creator @digging for bricks was
OL,8,Fcritical of the new bricks.
OL,10,F"This is obviously a play feature," he
OL,11,Fposted on Instagram.
OL,13,F"You know who loves play features,
OL,14,F(that's) kids. Do you know who does
OL,15,Fnot have $150 to spend on a set? Kids.
OL,16,FDo you know who does? Adults. Do you
OL,17,Fknow what adults do with their LEGO?
OL,18,FThey put them on display shelves, and
OL,19,Fthey don't use the play features."

OL,5,FHe also criticised changing something
OL,6,Fthat has typically offered escapism
OL,7,Ffrom technology.
OL,9,F"I am tired of technology being
OL,10,Fintroduced into every single thing in
OL,11,Flife. I build LEGO to take a break
OL,12,Ffrom technology and get away from
OL,13,Ftechnology."
OL,15,FOther comments suggest the new tech
OL,16,Ftakes away some of the element of
OL,17,Fimagination that makes LEGO fun, but
OL,18,Fthe company said that wasn't the case,
OL,19,Fposting: "Still absolutely vital!
OL,20,FImagination will always be key in
OL,21,Fcreating your own stories."
