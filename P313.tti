OL,6,F"A hybrid is a cross between two
OL,7,Fvarieties, and in this case that could
OL,8,Fbe other mandarins, clementines,
OL,9,Fsatsumas, oranges or even grapefruit,"
OL,10,FBennie Smidt, head of agronomy at AMT
OL,11,FFresh said.
OL,13,F"A cross means taking pollen from a
OL,14,Fcertain variety and pollinating a
OL,15,Fflower of a different variety. The
OL,16,Fresulting seeds within the fruits are
OL,17,Fthe hybrids, which will need to be

OL,10,FThe reduced number of satsumas being

OL,12,Ftastes towards clementines, Mr Smidt
OL,13,Fadded.
OL,15,F"As a result of their stronger taste,
