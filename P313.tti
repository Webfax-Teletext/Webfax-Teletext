OL,6,FDonald Trump has said he thinks
OL,7,FVolodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to give
OL,8,Fup Crimea to Russia as part of a
OL,9,Fceasefire deal, despite his Ukrainian
OL,10,Fcounterpart previously saying that
OL,11,Fsurrendering the land has always been
OL,12,Fa red line.
OL,14,FAsked by reporters on Sunday if
OL,15,FZelenskyy was ready to "give up"
OL,16,FCrimea, the US president said: "Oh, I
OL,17,Fthink so."

OL,8,Fceasefire deal to end the war. The
