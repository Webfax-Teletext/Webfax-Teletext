OL,13,FThe first set of prisoners to be

OL,17,FThere are exceptions, however. Those

OL,3,CWhy are thousands of prisoners to be

OL,6,FExperts say a combination of longer
OL,7,Fsentences for crimes, the creation of
OL,8,Fnew offences, record numbers of
OL,9,Freleased prisoners being recalled, and
OL,10,FCovid court backlogs have all
OL,11,Fcontributed.
OL,13,FEven with new prisons being built,
OL,14,Fprojections show that prison
OL,15,Fpopulations will grow faster.
OL,17,FThis new scheme replaces a previous
OL,18,Fplan implemented by the last

OL,20,Frelease some prisoners ten weeks early.
