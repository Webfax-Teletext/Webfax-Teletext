OL,6,FBy James Gray, ITV News Producer
OL,8,FCharities have urged polling stations
OL,9,Faround the United Kingdom to ensure
OL,10,Fthey do everything in their power to
OL,11,Fmake sure voting in the General
OL,12,FElection is "as accessible as
OL,13,Fpossible".
OL,15,FThe disability equality charity Scope
OL,16,Ftold ITV News that disabled voters can
OL,17,Fface a range of challenges when going
OL,18,Fto cast their ballot, including a lack
OL,19,Fof accessible parking or voting booths.

OL,6,FIt comes after the Royal National
OL,7,FInstitute of Blind People (RNIB)
OL,8,Fcalled it a "scandal" that blind and
OL,9,Fpartially sighted people are still

OL,4,Cstations - what must they provide?
OL,6,FThe RNIB, in an open letter to the
OL,7,Fgovernment, said it found only 13% of
OL,8,Fblind voters felt they could vote in
OL,9,Fsecret during the previous General
OL,10,FElection, in 2019.
OL,12,FWhile less than half (44%) of
OL,13,Fpartially sighted voters said the
OL,14,Fexisting system allowed them to cast
OL,15,Ftheir ballots independently.
OL,17,FThe charity is calling on the
OL,18,Fgovernment to make this General
OL,19,FElection the last "where blind people
OL,20,Fhave to share their vote".
