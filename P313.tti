OL,8,Fpopulation that rising temperatures
OL,9,Fcould pose a risk to those who are
OL,10,Fvulnerable.
OL,12,FSome may brand this the 'nanny state'
OL,13,Fbut the data speaks for itself.
OL,15,FAccording to the World Health
OL,16,FOrganisation, there are 176,000 heat-
OL,17,Frelated deaths each year in Europe. As
OL,18,Fa result of climate change they say
OL,19,Fthe number of over 65s dying from heat
OL,20,Fhas increased by 85% this century.

OL,10,FIt was an enlightening - and humbling

OL,13,FAs they cranked up the temperatures,
OL,14,Fto a high of 39 degrees Celsius, even
OL,15,Fmaintaining a brisk walking pace
OL,16,Fbecame a challenge.

OL,6,F"The risk of heat with the body is
OL,7,Fthat the core body temperature gets
OL,8,Ftoo high. Normal core body temperature
OL,9,Fis about 37 degrees. Once we start
OL,10,Fpushing that up above 38 and towards
OL,11,F39 and 40, we start to get into
