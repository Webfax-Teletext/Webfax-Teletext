OL,6,FThe first person has received a brain
OL,7,Fchip by Elon Musk's company Neuralink,
OL,8,Fthe tech billionaire said in a post on
OL,9,FX, formerly known as Twitter.
OL,11,FThe patient "is recovering well" Mr
OL,12,FMusk wrote, adding that initial
OL,13,Fresults of the device - called
OL,14,F"Telepathy" - show "promising neuron
OL,15,Fspike detection".
OL,17,FSo what is the chip, how does it work
OL,18,Fand who will benefit?

OL,6,FThe chip is a tiny implant with more
OL,7,Fthan 3,000 electrodes, attached to
OL,8,Fflexible threads measuring about the
OL,9,Ftenth of the size of a hair, and
OL,10,Fcapable of monitoring around 1,000
OL,11,Fneurons.
OL,13,FMr Musk described the device as "like
