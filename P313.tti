OL,3,CWhen will the Strawberry Moon appear

OL,7,FThe name originates from Native
OL,8,FAmerican tribes, who used the full
OL,9,Fmoon as a seasonal marker.
OL,11,FJune's full moon coincided with the
OL,12,Fstrawberry-picking season in the
OL,13,FUnited States, and so the name was
OL,14,Fcoined to indicate the start of the
OL,15,Fharvest.

OL,7,FSimilar traditions were observed in
OL,8,Fparts of Europe, where the June moon
OL,9,Fwas sometimes referred to as the Rose
OL,10,FMoon or Honey Moon, hinting at both
OL,11,Fthe summer solstice and the
OL,12,Ftraditional season for weddings.
OL,14,FWill the moon be pink?
OL,16,FDespite it's name, the Strawberry Moon
OL,17,Fwon't appear pink, however it may look
OL,18,Fslightly tinted due to a phenomenon
OL,19,Fknown as 'moon illusion'.

OL,3,CWhen will the Strawberry Moon appear

OL,7,FBecause of its lower position in the
OL,8,Fsky during summer months, especially
OL,9,Ffor the Northern Hemisphere, the full
OL,10,Fmoon often appears larger and more
OL,11,Fgolden than usual, when it's close to
OL,12,Fthe horizon.
OL,14,FIt's also a supermoon, meaning the
OL,15,Fmoon is at or near its closest point
OL,16,Fto Earth in its orbit, making it
OL,17,Fappear slightly brighter and bigger
OL,18,Fthan an average full moon.
