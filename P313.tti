OL,9,Flikely to occur in built-up areas or
OL,10,Fbeneath roads, and could happen in

OL,13,FFarrant, Regional Geologist of

OL,15,FSociety.
OL,17,FHe adds that many recent sinkholes
OL,18,Fhave been caused by collapses of old

OL,21,FDecember 2024.

OL,12,F"Sand can be strong when compacted as

OL,18,Fsaid the cause of the Godstone holes

OL,6,FTypical backfill materials for
