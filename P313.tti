OL,6,FResearchers have made a huge
OL,7,Fbreakthrough that could resurrect the
OL,8,Fbefore 2028.
OL,10,FScientists from Colossal Biosciences
OL,11,Fhave successfully created elephant
OL,12,F'pluripotent' stem cells which can
OL,13,Fgrow into any cell in the body.
OL,15,FCo-founder and lead geneticist of
OL,16,FColossal has said the creation of
OL,17,Fthese cells could "open the door" to
OL,18,Fbringing the mammoth back from
OL,19,Fextinction.

OL,11,FBut how would it work? In 2006, a
OL,12,Fscientist named Shinya Yamanaka
OL,13,Fdiscovered that you could use a
OL,14,Fchemical cocktail to trigger cells

OL,15,FThey would then be induced to grow
