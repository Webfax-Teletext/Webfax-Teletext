OL,6,FThe Isle of Man has come one step
OL,7,Fcloser to legalising after the wording
OL,8,Fof the island's Assisted Dying Bill
OL,9,Fwas debated on Tuesday.
OL,11,FDr Alex Allinson, who is behind the

OL,13,Fand evidence taken from expert
OL,14,Fwitnesses, the island's parliament,

OL,16,F"another landmark step in delivering

OL,17,Fstill debated among medical

OL,20,Fbroadly speaking it is the process of
