OL,6,FNow Altaf's grief is bound up in a
OL,7,Fquestion no family should ever have to
OL,8,Fask.
OL,10,FWhen he laid his parents to rest, he
OL,11,Fasked: "Is it our loved ones that we
OL,12,Fburied?"
OL,14,FThis is the question that has troubled

OL,15,FAs we sat down for the interview,
