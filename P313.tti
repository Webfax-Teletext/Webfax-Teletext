OL,6,FI understand Starmer's offer to the
OL,7,Fwelfare rebel MPs is to protect PIP
OL,8,Fpayments for all existing claimants
OL,9,Fforever.
OL,11,FThere would be no detriment from the
OL,12,Freforms for existing claimants.
OL,14,FThis would shave circa #2bn from the
OL,15,Freform savings by 2029. I am unclear
OL,16,Fwhether this would persuade enough
OL,17,Frebels to back the remaining reforms
OL,18,Fin next Tuesday's vote.

OL,6,FThere will also be "grandfathering" of
OL,7,Fthe disability top up universal credit
OL,8,Ffor existing claimants. So again no

OL,16,Fled by Treasury committee chair Meg
