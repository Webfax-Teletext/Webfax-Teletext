OL,6,FThis is our earliest frost for 20

OL,6,FAt least we have some September
OL,7,Fsunshine forecast in the next few days
OL,8,F- albeit with lower temperatures than
OL,9,Fwe would like. Expect some clear,
OL,10,Fcrisp, cold mornings.
OL,12,FThe chilly air is forecast to give way
OL,13,Fthis weekend, with a switch in the
OL,14,Fwind direction, we'll draw in milder
OL,15,Fair from the southwest and mid-
OL,16,FAtlantic and temperatures will recover.
OL,18,FExpect nearer 20-23C early next week -
OL,19,Fit'll feel very pleasant after the
OL,20,Fchilly feel this week.
