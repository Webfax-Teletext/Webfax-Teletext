OL,7,FOne. Radio Times: "Live coverage of an
OL,8,Fattempt by four climbers on the most
OL,9,Ffamous chunk of rock in Britain. It's
OL,10,F17 years since Hoy was televised but
OL,11,Fthe risks haven't diminished. Murray
OL,12,FHamilton and Pete Whillance will
OL,13,Ftackle the overhanging south-east
OL,14,Fedge, but without the protection of
OL,15,Fthe bolts and pitons used on the first
OL,16,Fascent. The rock itself, Torridon
OL,17,Fsandstone, has a tendency to crumble
OL,18,Flike a digestive biscuit. Also on the
OL,19,Fsouth face is the legendary Joe Brown,
OL,20,Fclimbing with his daughter Zoe." Eric
OL,21,FRobson and Paul Braithwaite provide
OL,22,Fcommentary.
