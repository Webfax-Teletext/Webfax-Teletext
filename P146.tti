OL,6,GSaturday's schedule must have been a
OL,7,Glogistical nightmare for BBC planners
OL,8,Gand the Pres team.
OL,10,FBoth BBC One and ITV 1 had live
OL,11,Fcoverage of the FA Cup Final.
OL,13,FBut the BBC had the hardest schedule
OL,14,Fto pull together.
OL,16,FHad Crystal Palace not scored ` or if
OL,17,FManchester City equalised ` the game
OL,18,Fwould have gone to extra time and
OL,19,Fpossibly penalties.

OL,14,Foptions. Undoubtedly consideration had

OL,14,FHowever ITV 1 ` without the wider

OL,16,Fconsider ` simply dropped their
OL,17,Fregional bulletin altogether.
