OL,9,FIt has been reported that the budget
OL,10,Ffaces a massive cut and that the
OL,11,Fformat may change. So far nothing has
OL,12,Fbeen confirmed.
OL,14,FBut given the BBC's financial
OL,15,Fsituation and the programme's low
OL,16,Fviewing figures, it is inevitable
OL,17,Fthat questions will be asked about
OL,18,Fwhether Newsnight in its current form

OL,8,Fthe main BBC One news moved to 10pm

OL,11,FIt was always a big ask to expect

OL,6,FIt is worth noting that the programme
OL,7,Fmounted a full recovery from the
OL,8,Ffallout over the Jimmy Savile scandal
OL,9,Fand a subsequent flawed investigation
OL,10,Finto alleged child abuse. The credit

OL,15,FNewsnight, the loss of a daily forum

OL,17,Fon a major BBC channel should surely
