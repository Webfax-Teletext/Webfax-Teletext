OL,3,CITV licence renewal: a far cry from
OL,4,Cthe process of the past
OL,6,GITV looks set to confirm within the
OL,7,Gnext few days that it has renewed its
OL,8,Gchannel 3 licences.
OL,10,FThe broadcaster has about another
OL,11,Ffortnight to do so.
OL,13,FLast week its Scottish counterpart STV
OL,14,Fquietly confirmed it had agreed its
OL,15,Fnew 10-year licence from Ofcom.
OL,17,FWhat's interesting is that this
OL,18,Flicence renewal process has scarcely
OL,19,Fmerited public interest.

OL,3,CITV licence renewal: a far cry from
OL,4,Cthe process of the past
OL,6,FThere was, at least, some public
OL,7,Fdiscussion over the last renewal in
OL,8,F2013.
OL,10,FIt led to the reversal of some cuts in
OL,11,Fregional output introduced by ITV a
OL,12,Ffew years earlier ` notably the
OL,13,Freintroduction of a dedicated news
OL,14,Fservice for the Border region and
OL,15,Flocal programmes for the Scottish part
OL,16,Fof its area.
OL,18,FGiven the lack of public comment, it
OL,19,Fwould appear ITV is not discussing any
OL,20,Fmajor changes to its regional news

OL,11,FThere may be slight tweaks of course.
OL,13,FIt became apparent during the
