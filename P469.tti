OL,11,FTransport Secretary Ken Skates has

OL,6,FSince September 2023, local
OL,7,Fauthorities in Wales have been obliged
OL,8,Fto set speed limits in urban and
OL,9,Fresidential areas at 20mph as a
OL,10,Fdefault, becoming the first UK nation
OL,11,Fto do so.
OL,13,FThe policy has been controversial
OL,14,Fsince it came into force, with nearly
OL,15,F470,000 signatures on a petition to
OL,16,Frevert the lowering of the speed limit.
OL,18,FCouncils have already been allowed to

OL,13,FSpeaking to ITV Cymru Wales, Mr Skates
OL,14,Fsaid: "It's not a u-turn. We are
OL,15,Frefining the policy and making sure
OL,16,Fthat we acknowledge that the vast
OL,17,Fmajority of people in Wales believe
OL,18,Fthat slower speeds are ideal outside

OL,20,Fand built-up residential areas."
