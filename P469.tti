OL,6,FA miner and the police officer who

OL,8,Fago this week have been reunited.
OL,10,FThat moment decades ago was captured
OL,11,Fby a young photo journalist
OL,12,Fdocumenting the turmoil of the time.
OL,13,FRichard Williams caught the moment a
OL,14,Fminer was arrested as he tried to stop
OL,15,Fa bus of his colleagues from going to
OL,16,Fwork.
OL,18,FNow the miner, Jeff Jones from

OL,20,FMark Chinn, the officer who arrested
OL,21,Fhim during the miners strike.

OL,6,FWednesday marks 40 years since a
OL,7,Fstrike started in south Wales, and
OL,8,Fother parts of the UK, which lasted
OL,9,Fjust three days short of a year.
OL,11,FFirst Minister Mark Drakeford told ITV
OL,12,FWales the scars from the 1984-1985
OL,13,Fstrike "live on" to this day.
OL,15,FFor Jeff, the wounds of that time
OL,16,Fstill run deep. He said: "Yes there is
OL,17,Fsome resentment there with regards to
OL,18,Fthe police" and those who crossed the
OL,19,Fpicket line.

OL,6,FHe added: "That resentment will never,

OL,8,Fand a lot of people would agree with
OL,9,Fme - once you're a scab (who returned
OL,10,Fto work) you're always a scab. You
OL,11,Fdon't cross the picket line."
OL,13,FEven 40 years on, Jeff's view is one
OL,14,Fwhich is shared by a large number of
OL,15,Fpeople heavily involved in the strikes.
OL,17,FRichard Williams, who took the photo
OL,18,Fat the start of his career, has

OL,14,FHe added: "Really, looking back on it
