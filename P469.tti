OL,6,FThe Welsh Rugby Players' Association
OL,7,Fhas called on the WRU to heed the
OL,8,Fwords of its members as the game in
OL,9,FWales prepares for complete overhaul.
OL,11,FOn Wednesday, the WRU revealed its
OL,12,Fpreferred option for the future
OL,13,Fstructure of elite rugby, which
OL,14,Fincludes halving the number of pro
OL,15,Fmen's clubs to two.
OL,17,FWe don't currently know which clubs
OL,18,Fcould go and there is now real
OL,19,Funcertainty throughout the game.
