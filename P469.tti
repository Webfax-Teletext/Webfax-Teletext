OL,6,FDylan Morgan is an ordinary teenager
OL,7,Fwith an extraordinary story.
OL,9,FEighteen months ago he was playing for
OL,10,FBargoed under-13s against Monmouth
OL,11,Fwhen he took a knock to the head.
OL,13,FInitially he was treated for
OL,14,Fconcussion and showed no symptoms, so
OL,15,Fhe was allowed to continue.
OL,17,FThe full-back carried on playing, not
OL,18,Fmaking contact with the ball again,
OL,19,Fbut something was awry.

OL,6,FHis father, Chris, who is also one of
OL,7,Fthe coaches, noticed his son just
OL,8,F"wandering" around the field, not
OL,9,Fengaged in the game at all.
OL,11,FThen he let a ball-carrier simply run
OL,12,Fpast him and did nothing to prevent a
OL,13,Ftry being scored.
OL,15,FDad Chris told ITV Cymru Wales: "I was
OL,16,Fthinking that's strange and it's not
OL,17,Flike Dylan. I actually said something
OL,18,Fthat will haunt me because it could
