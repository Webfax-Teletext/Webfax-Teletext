OL,6,F"Basically, the reason that we have
OL,7,Fhim is because we also have another
OL,8,Fyoung sloth, Button who is female and
OL,9,Fwe're part of the European breeding
OL,10,Fscheme.
OL,12,F"So, the idea is to get them together
OL,13,Fand hopefully, fingers crossed, one
OL,14,Fday they will have baby sloths."
OL,16,FWhen asked how is Nova settling in so
OL,17,Ffar, Natasha, said: "He's done really
OL,18,Fwell. He's quite a curious sloth.

OL,4,Cwith hopes he'll be a 'Casanova'
OL,6,F"He's only over 2 years old. He was
OL,7,Fborn in November 2021. It's very
OL,8,Fdifferent for him because he's with
OL,9,Fanother sloth and he's only been with
OL,10,Fhis mother.
OL,12,F"So, it's been a bit of an adjustment.
OL,13,FBut he's doing really well. He's
OL,14,Ftaking carrots and having new
OL,15,Fexperiences. He's lovely."
OL,17,FSloths are regarded as one of the
OL,18,Fslowest and laziest animals in the
OL,19,Fworld and Nova and Button are expected
OL,20,Fto take a similar laidback attitude to
OL,21,Fhaving cubs.

OL,6,FNatasha added: "It will take a while.
OL,7,FI think part of that is that they are
OL,8,Fslow and they sleep quite a lot. Also,
OL,9,Fthey are not the most sociable
OL,10,Fspecies, they are solitary.
OL,12,F"We might have to wait for a couple of
OL,13,Fyears, until they start showing signs
OL,14,Fof being interested in one another.
OL,16,F"At the moment they have been quite
OL,17,Fseparate. They have not had any fights
OL,18,For spats or anything so, in a couple
OL,19,Fof years hopefully we can start to
OL,20,Fthink about a nursery for them."

OL,8,Fsaid: "A lot of people don't quite

OL,11,Fhabitat.
OL,13,F"The fact that the impact that humans
OL,14,Fare having on them. So, with this we
OL,15,Fcan draw people in and also educate
OL,16,Fthem at the same time.
OL,18,F"Although sloths are not critically
OL,19,Fendangered, it doesn't mean they
OL,20,Faren't in the risk of coming in that
OL,21,Fcategory due to deforestation."
