OL,6,FFormer First Minister Mark Drakeford
OL,7,Fsaid his successor Vaughan Gething
OL,8,F"deserved better" than his short-lived
OL,9,Fpremiership.
OL,11,FMr Gething was in the top position for

OL,13,Ftime in office was dogged by questions
OL,14,Fover a #200,000 campaign donation from
OL,15,Fa businessman convicted of
OL,16,Fenvironmental offences.
OL,18,FSpeaking to ITV Wales' Sharp End, his

OL,20,Flooks back on that time "with a great
OL,21,Fdeal of sadness".
