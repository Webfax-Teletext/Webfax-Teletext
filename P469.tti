OL,8,Fimportant things the review did was
OL,9,F"capture Kaylea and her energy and

OL,15,FShe continued: "We found there were
OL,16,Fmissed opportunities of things such as
OL,17,Fmonitoring Kaylea's weight, having
OL,18,Fbetter monitoring of her skincare and
OL,19,Fthere was a lack of coordination to
