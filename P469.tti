OL,13,FThe tunnel is closed from July 3 to
OL,14,FJuly 19 so engineers can replace more

OL,17,FIt's a mammoth task, with teams also

OL,19,Fand over 22,000 tonnes of ballast.

OL,12,Fabout the complexity of managing the

OL,15,F"It's an incredible feat of
OL,16,Fengineering. It's 7000 meters long and
OL,17,Ffor many years was the longest tunnel
OL,18,Fin Great Britain. It does take care
OL,19,Fand attention and we've got a number

OL,21,Ftunnel at any one time."
