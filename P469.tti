OL,10,FMr Miles said it is about more than

OL,14,FHe said: "I think what party members

OL,6,FOn 20mph both Jeremy Miles and Vaughan

OL,11,FThe lowering of the default speed
OL,12,Flimit, which the Welsh Government says
OL,13,Fwas largely due to safety reasons, has
OL,14,Fdivided public opinion.
OL,16,FHowever, Mr Miles stuck by the policy
OL,17,Fas "the right one". He added: "It's
OL,18,Fthere to save lives and make our roads
OL,19,Fsafer but what people are telling us
OL,20,Fis they don't understand why roads
OL,21,Fthat they know are 20mph.
