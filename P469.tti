OL,7,FIn his opening, prosecutor Matthew
OL,8,FCobbe said police officers faced
OL,9,Fhostility as they set up cordons to
OL,10,Fprotect the scene where the boys died.
OL,11,FHe said it escalated rapidly. And he
OL,12,Fdescribed how "bottles, bricks,
OL,13,Fplasterboard and more were hurled at
OL,14,Fpolice officers".
OL,16,FHe said: "A fire was set and fireworks
OL,17,Fthrown, cars trashed, overturned and
OL,18,Fset alight. A petrol bomb was thrown
OL,19,Fat a police officer and covered her in
OL,20,Fflames. It was carnage for several
OL,21,Fhours."
