OL,8,FWelsh rugby to be competitive again.
OL,10,FFor the better part of a decade, the

OL,12,Fthe Test arena glossed over the myriad
OL,13,Fof cracks which were appearing beneath

OL,16,FThe game in Wales has been in a quiet
OL,17,Fdecline for years, with the four
OL,18,Fprofessional sides - Cardiff, Dragons,
OL,19,FOspreys and Scarlets - becoming less
OL,20,Fand less competitive.
