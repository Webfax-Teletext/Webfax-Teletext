OL,6,FThe former Archbishop of Wales has
OL,7,Fdescribed his decision to step down as
OL,8,F"very painful".
OL,10,FAndrew John told BBC Radio Cymru that
OL,11,Fcalls for his resignation were a
OL,12,F"nightmare", but it is "right to give
OL,13,Fsomeone else the opportunity to take
OL,14,Fresponsibility for the future".
OL,16,FMr John announced he was retiring as
OL,17,FArchbishop with immediate effect at
OL,18,Fthe end of June. He also confirmed he
OL,19,Fwould stand down as Bishop of Bangor.

OL,6,FThe announcement came after two
OL,7,Fsummary reviews were published on
OL,8,Fbehaviour at Bangor Cathedral, which
OL,9,Fincluded details of "inappropriate
OL,10,Fbehaviour", "blurred sexual
OL,11,Fboundaries" and "excessive alcohol
OL,12,Fconsumption".
OL,14,FThe Church in Wales has now called for
OL,15,Fa number of additional reviews and
OL,16,Finvestigations of Bangor Cathedral and
OL,17,Fthe diocese.
OL,19,FThere is no suggestion that the former
OL,20,FArchbishop acted inappropriately.

OL,6,F"Being present at the meeting and
OL,7,Fhaving people more or less calling for
OL,8,Fyour resignation was like being in a

OL,11,F"It pains me that these things
