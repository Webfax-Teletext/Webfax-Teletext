OL,6,FInvestigators suspected the incident
OL,7,Fwas caused by slippery rails.
OL,9,FThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch
OL,10,F(RAIB) said last week that the
OL,11,Fcondition of the track on the approach
OL,12,Fto the collision point meant
OL,13,F"adhesion" between wheels and rails
OL,14,Fwas "relatively low".
OL,16,FIt said this suggested an Aberystwyth-
OL,17,Fbound train may have slid while
OL,18,Fbraking, causing it to crash at a
OL,19,Fspeed of around 15mph into a
OL,20,Fstationary train destined for
