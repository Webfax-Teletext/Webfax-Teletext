OL,7,FWelsh NHS will have to reform to
OL,8,Fbecome "fit for the future", including
OL,9,Flooking at involving the private

OL,15,Fyears, has been opposed to using
OL,16,Fprivate firms.
OL,18,FIn an interview with ITV Cymru Wales,
OL,19,FSir Keir said it is his "strong view"
OL,20,Fthat any extra money for the NHS has
