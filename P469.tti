OL,9,F'significant' sand shifts that are

OL,12,FThe Flying Foam met its fateful end in
OL,13,F1936 after trying to battle against a

OL,15,Fwas unable survive.
OL,17,FNow, almost nine decades on, an
OL,18,Fexhibition at Llandudno Museum is
OL,19,Flooking at the life of the vessel and
OL,20,Fwhat future it may have as it becomes
OL,21,Fcovered by the surrounding sand.

OL,6,FBuilt in 1861 by George Asplet, a boat
OL,7,Fbuilder from Jersey, the Flying Foam's
OL,8,Fmain purpose was to sail around the
OL,9,Fcoast of the UK delivering goods. The
OL,10,Flast owner of the vessel was filmmaker
OL,11,Fand actor, Kenelm Foss.
OL,13,FThe Flying Foam is said to have had a
OL,14,Fturbulent time at sea, having several
OL,15,Fmishaps during her time.
OL,17,FBut it was in January 1936 that the
OL,18,Fvessel finally gave out during a storm.

OL,6,FDebbie explains that it's due to the
OL,7,Famount of sand covering the vessel,
OL,8,Fwhich is starting to bury it in its
OL,9,Fcurrent position.
OL,11,FShe said: "Although the amount of sand
OL,12,Fcovering the Flying Foam would change
OL,13,Fthrough the year, the timbers were
OL,14,Fgenerally always visible to some
OL,15,Fdegree.
OL,17,F"But in 2020, I noticed that there had
OL,18,Fbeen a significant change at the wreck
OL,19,Fsite and the amount of sand covering
OL,20,Fthe Flying Foam had increased more
OL,21,Fthan usual.
