OL,6,F"We're having unfortunately to decline
OL,7,Ffood parcel referrals coming in from
OL,8,Fsupport workers, and people that are
OL,9,Fjust generally in need, whether
OL,10,Fthey're from the Muslim community,

OL,12,FNewport," Gemma Walker, manager of
OL,13,FFeed Newport said.
OL,15,FShe added that the food bank put out
OL,16,Fan appeal for donations a few weeks
OL,17,Fago as there has been a decline in the
OL,18,Fnumber of donations.

OL,13,FThe food bank started up in February
OL,14,F2020 and continued throughout the

OL,17,FBased in Newport, the hub has also
