OL,6,FIt is a song that sends shivers down
OL,7,Fthe spine, that reduces adults to
OL,8,Ftears and represents Wales around the
OL,9,Fworld. It is, of course, the Welsh
OL,10,Fnational anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau.
OL,12,FNow, the grave of the man who composed
OL,13,Fthe tune has been restored at an
OL,14,FAberdare cemetery.
OL,16,FHarpist James James composed the
OL,17,Fmelody in January 1856, while his
OL,18,Ffather, Evan James wrote the words.
OL,20,FJames died in 1902 and over the years
OL,21,Fhis grave showed signs of age.
