OL,6,FThe discovery of the first pair of

OL,8,Fmore than two hundred years has seen
OL,9,Fan end to plans for the Green Man

OL,13,FIn May 2022, the Welsh Government

OL,15,FGilestone Farm in Talybont-on-Usk,
OL,16,Fwith the intention of leasing it to

OL,6,FBut the sale proved to be hugely
OL,7,Fcontroversial, with the Welsh

OL,11,FToday the Economy Minister Vaughan

OL,15,Fhad decided to nest on the site.
OL,17,FBut he also confirmed that a 750m

OL,19,Faround the farm. It means the full
OL,20,Fbusiness plan set out by the Green Man
OL,21,FGroup can no longer be realised.
