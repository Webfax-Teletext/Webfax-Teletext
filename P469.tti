OL,6,FThe initiative is the brainchild of Dr
OL,7,FJoanne May - creator of the paediatric

OL,9,Fthat children only get a limited

OL,11,Fspent on condition management and
OL,12,Ftreatment.
OL,14,FShe said: "Early on, we recognised
OL,15,Fthat creative interventions would
OL,16,Fbenefit children not only because
OL,17,Fdance elements would support movement,
OL,18,Fbut also because they provided an
OL,19,Fopportunity to build confidence and
