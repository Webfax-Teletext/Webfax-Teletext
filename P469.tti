OL,6,FSian Bolton, from Safe Roads
OL,7,FPontyclun, said: "The quarry from
OL,8,Fwhere we're standing now (on the high
OL,9,Fstreet) is probably less than five
OL,10,Fminutes' drive but 90% of their
OL,11,Fvehicles come through the village - or
OL,12,Fas it is, town, now - of Pontyclun.
OL,13,FThat's an incredible amount of HGVs.
OL,15,F"We're looking at, if this proposal if
OL,16,Fapproved, at least one every two
OL,17,Fminutes. This is not about the
OL,18,Fexisting lorries back and forwards,
OL,19,Fit's about the proposal to increase
OL,20,Fthose lorries."

OL,9,FThat view was echoed by other
