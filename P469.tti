OL,7,F"It started really in the 18th century
OL,8,Fwhen a gentleman called John Wilkinson
OL,9,Fcame here. John Wilkinson was an
OL,10,Fentrepreneur. He had set up Ironworks
OL,11,Fright across the country. And what
OL,12,Fyou're seeing here is what is left of
OL,13,Fthat time, which is truly amazing," he
OL,14,Fsaid.
OL,16,FAfter John Wilkinson and the
OL,17,Fproduction of iron came steel.
OL,19,FThe area of Brymbo was decimated when
OL,20,Fthe steelworks closed in 1990 with the
OL,21,Floss of over one thousand jobs.
