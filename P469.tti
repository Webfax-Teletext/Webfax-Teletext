OL,10,Fgoing'.
OL,12,F"We will do everything we can just to
OL,13,Fhave her name out there, her picture
OL,14,Fout there. We will do whatever it
OL,15,Ftakes because that's all we can do.
OL,17,F"The amount of support we have had
OL,18,Ffrom friends and family who have done
OL,19,Ffundraisers for us is incredible. And
OL,20,Fthe amount of money that we have
OL,21,Fraised so far is just amazing."
