OL,4,CSwansea West
OL,6,FTorsten Bell likes it strong.
OL,8,F"There's nothing worse than insipid
OL,9,Ftea" he tells me while making us a
OL,10,Fcuppa in his kitchen. "The bag must
OL,11,Fnot be removed."
OL,13,FWe also had a good discussion on the
OL,14,Fmerits of air fryers. They play a
OL,15,Fbigger role in Torsten's life right
OL,16,Fnow than you might think.
OL,18,FHis latest book, Great Britain? How We
OL,19,FGet Our Future Back is competing
OL,20,Fagainst the latest air fryer cookbook
OL,21,Ffor public attention.

OL,3,CMeet Torsten Bell, the new MP for
OL,4,CSwansea West
OL,6,FAny publisher will tell you, it's the
OL,7,Ffryer that wins. I figure this is the
OL,8,Fnot the kind of conversation the new
OL,9,FSwansea West MP is used to having.
OL,11,FMaybe his old bosses, like former
OL,12,FChancellor Alistair Darling or Ed
OL,13,FMiliband, had strong views on airfryed
OL,14,Fsalmon skewers, but I somehow doubt it.
OL,16,FTorsten is a thinker, or to use a
OL,17,FWestminster term a, "policy wonk."
OL,18,FUntil recently he was head of the
OL,19,FResolution Foundation think tank.

OL,11,F"You're used to talking about economic

OL,15,FHe jumps on the chance to explain why
