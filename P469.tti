OL,6,FA spokesperson for the council said:
OL,7,F"The annual Christmas budget is set in
OL,8,FJanuary and varies between #5,000 and
OL,9,F#10,000 every year. We are currently
OL,10,Fjust over #6,000 for all of the

OL,13,F"It covers everything from hiring
OL,14,Ftelehandlers to replacing lights as
OL,15,Fwell as purchasing the lights and
OL,16,Fframe for our new tree installation.
OL,17,FWe have invested in this product,
OL,18,Fwhich can be easily stored and reused,
OL,19,Fbecause it will save us the cost of a
OL,20,Flive tree every year, an estimated
OL,21,Fannual saving of #1,000.
