OL,9,FIt is thought that despite high

OL,11,Facross the island.
OL,13,FCare home owner Martin Joyce says the
OL,14,Fissue is a backlog with the Needs
OL,15,FAssessment Panel (NAPS), which decides
OL,16,Fon the type of care best suited to

OL,19,FMartin explains that some people stay

OL,6,FHe adds: "What we're trying to urge

OL,9,Fgive interim care to those who would

OL,13,F"There's somebody in a hospital bed at

OL,17,FOne Guernsey resident says the empty

OL,6,FChair of CareWatch, Bella Farrell,
OL,7,Fsays: "There are lots of issues but
OL,8,Ffair access is one. It's very hard for
OL,9,Fme to think you might have a lot of
OL,10,Fassets and yet you would not pay fully
OL,11,Ffor your care later on in life.
OL,13,F"Equally, if you don't have those
OL,14,Fassets. I can see why people would
OL,15,Fthink I've worked all these years for
OL,16,Fmy home and now I have to sell it for
OL,17,Fmy care and that's tough for people
OL,18,Ftoo."
