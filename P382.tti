OL,6,FThe former Chief Executive Officer of
OL,7,Fthe Channel Islands Co-op, Colin
OL,8,FMacLeod, says he feels a "melting pot
OL,9,Fof emotions" after Jersey's Royal

OL,11,Fhim #3.5 million in compensation.
OL,13,FThe judgment, one of the largest civil
OL,14,Fcourt payouts in the island's history,
OL,15,Ffollows a lengthy legal battle after
OL,16,FMr MacLeod was removed from the
OL,17,Forganisation in 2020.
