OL,6,FThis weekend's cycle was one of the

OL,8,Fbelieve that the stake was

OL,10,Fan act of protest.
OL,12,FThis is despite the group clearly-
OL,13,Fsignposting areas where they ride.
OL,15,FDan Thwaite, Chair of the GMBA, says
OL,16,Fit's unfortunate that the group's
OL,17,Factivities have been challenged so
OL,18,Fearly into their trial.
OL,20,FHe says: "It's not really something
