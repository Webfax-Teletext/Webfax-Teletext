OL,10,FThe primary school is the only one on
OL,11,Fthe small island, serving a population
OL,12,Fof around 60 people and their families.
OL,14,FGuernsey's Education Committee shut
OL,15,Fdown the school in April 2023 due to a
OL,16,Flack of financial viability.
OL,18,FHowever, after dissent from islanders
OL,19,Fand other Guernsey politicians, it was
OL,20,Fre-opened four months later.

OL,6,FIn last week's States debate,

OL,8,FAndrea Dudley-Owen, stated that at the
OL,9,Fbeginning of the next school year,
OL,10,Fthere could be just one pupil at the

OL,12,Foperate.
OL,14,FHerm Island's leaseholder, John
OL,15,FSinger, disagrees.
OL,17,FHe expects to have four school pupils
OL,18,Fin Herm by September; there are eight
