OL,6,FDeputy Tom Binet told ITV News: "The
OL,7,FStates Assembly agreed to extend FOIs
OL,8,Fto arms length organisations some 10
OL,9,Fyears ago. We're going to be looking
OL,10,Fat that again in the spring, but it's

OL,14,F"When FOIs first came in for the
OL,15,FStates, we were expecting 60 year,
OL,16,Fwe're now getting a 1,000. We've done
OL,17,Fa cost estimate and it is costing the
