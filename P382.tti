OL,6,FOn Thursday 19 September, the court
OL,7,Fheard the last day of defence, where
OL,8,FMr Sevash-Zade said he had no concerns
OL,9,Fabout how close the Commodore Goodwill
OL,10,Fand L'Ecume II were.
OL,12,FThe court has previously heard that
OL,13,Fboth defendants were on lookout on the
OL,14,FCondor Ferries' bridge the morning of
OL,15,Fthe incident, but Mr Carr had sent Mr
OL,16,FSevash-Zade away for breakfast before
OL,17,Fthe collision.

OL,6,FMr Sevash-Zade told the court that

OL,8,Fonto the Goodwill's bridge wings to
OL,9,Fperform other tasks.
OL,11,FMr Sevash-Zade was then asked by his
OL,12,Flawyer, Advocate Mike Preston, how the
OL,13,Fother defendant, Mr Carr, was behaving.
OL,15,FHe replied: "He looked calm, his voice
OL,16,Fwas calm, and it was normal."

OL,12,F"At the time when I was leaving, I

OL,16,FCrown Advocate Matthew Maletroit,

OL,18,Fhe made no effort to monitor the
OL,19,FL'Ecume II, but Mr Sevash-Zade argued

OL,21,Fthat is what he was doing.

OL,11,FThe court heard that Mr Sevash-Zade

OL,8,Fsaid he went to the starboard, the

OL,10,Fchecked to see if the L'Ecume II was

OL,13,FMr Sevash-Zade replied, "You are

OL,16,FAdvocate Maletroit also said Mr Sevash-
