OL,6,FJersey Electricity's (JE) CEO has
OL,7,Fdefended a 7.5% tariff increase for
OL,8,Fislanders from next year.
OL,10,FThe price hike will come into force on
OL,11,F1 January 2025 and will add around #2
OL,12,Fper week to the average domestic
OL,13,Felectricity bill of #1,400-a-year.
OL,15,FChris Ambler told ITV News that the
OL,16,Fmove was motivated by higher than
OL,17,Fnormal wholesale energy prices.
OL,19,FMr Ambler said: "We're extremely
OL,20,Fconscious of the pressure on household
OL,21,Fbudgets at the moment.

OL,6,FWhen asked why the tariff was being

OL,8,Finflation in Jersey (5%), Mr Ambler
OL,9,Fsaid: "We need to cover our costs and
OL,10,Fwe need to make sure that we can pay
OL,11,Four bills and if we don't pay our
OL,12,Fbills then, of course, the French will

OL,20,Fof the group is extremely good."
