OL,6,FHowever, in a States Meeting today
OL,7,F(Tuesday 12 November) on the

OL,10,Fsaid that Condor had rejected this

OL,12,Fwere "surprised and disappointed" by
OL,13,Fthe offer.
OL,15,FIt would have seen Condor maintain

OL,18,FBrittany Ferries becoming the long-
OL,19,Fterm ferry service providers.

OL,6,FNow Deputy Morel says he will decide

OL,8,F"in the short term and the long term"
OL,9,Fwithin the next month.
OL,11,FHe added a new contract will be drawn
