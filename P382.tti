OL,6,F"I think it is right and proper that

OL,9,Fcircumstances."
OL,11,FDeputy Tom Coles had raised the issue
OL,12,Fin the States Assembly, calling the
OL,13,Fcurrent situation "immoral".
OL,15,FHe explains: "We still have people

OL,18,Fhave that conviction there.

OL,10,FSame-sex relationships were

OL,12,FDeputy Le Hegarat says court officials
