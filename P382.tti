OL,8,Fsays: "We have that first time

OL,10,Fagain - and it makes us extremely
OL,11,Fproud as it's not that easy to
OL,12,Freproduce, so they require some
OL,13,Fspecial situations."
OL,15,FAlthough the newborn does not have a

OL,7,Fwell, it's feeding nicely and it's
OL,8,Fstarted to take on different food
OL,9,Fitems.
OL,11,F"It tends to sit and rest for about 10
OL,12,Fminutes and then it gets active and
OL,13,Fruns around for 10 to 15 minutes, and
OL,14,Fthen it rests again, falling asleep.
OL,15,FAll before exploring again - it's a
OL,16,Fvery active animal."
OL,18,FAnd resting is something the new dad
