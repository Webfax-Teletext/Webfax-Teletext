OL,11,Fcost of living increases placing a

OL,14,F"Earlier this year, I warned of the
OL,15,Fpossibility of no dividend or a
OL,16,Freduced dividend. I'm now pleased to
OL,17,Fannounce that at the upcoming Annual
OL,18,FMembers Meeting in May, the Board will
OL,19,Fpropose a 2% dividend relating to our
OL,20,F2023 trading year, on which you will
OL,21,Fbe invited to vote."
