OL,6,FIconic 1970s singer-songwriter Gilbert
OL,7,FO'Sullivan has expressed interest in
OL,8,Fperforming in Jersey for the first
OL,9,Ftime since he moved to the island more
OL,10,Fthan 30 years ago.
OL,12,FHaving settled in Jersey to raise his
OL,13,Ffamily, the Irishman does all his
OL,14,Fwriting in his home studio and says
OL,15,Fhis love of the island keeps him
OL,16,Fmotivated.
OL,18,FAnd though he's never performed in the
OL,19,FChannel Islands, that could be set to
OL,20,Fchange in the near future.

OL,12,FHe teased: "The plan will be once the

OL,6,FHe explains: "If I need to come up
OL,7,Fwith songs I'll work on it for however
OL,8,Flong it takes - that is what I have
OL,9,Fdone since I was sixteen years old."
OL,11,FHis methods are undoubtedly
OL,12,Fsuccessful. Hits such as 'Alone
OL,13,FAgain', 'Clair', 'Get Down', and
OL,14,F'Nothing Rhymed' propelled O'Sullivan
OL,15,Ftowards global stardom, finding
OL,16,Fparticular fame in the UK, North
OL,17,FAmerica, and - unusually - Japan.
OL,19,FOf this success, he says: "I was as
OL,20,Fsurprised as anybody when it all took
OL,21,Foff.

OL,6,F"The interesting thing about Japan is
OL,7,Fthat I get letters from people telling

OL,12,FHe adds, however, that a sense of
OL,13,Fdetermination and self-belief has
OL,14,Funderpinned much of his work, saying:
OL,15,F"You have to be the one to say look at
