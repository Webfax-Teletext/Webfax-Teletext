OL,6,FJersey's government has been
OL,7,Fcriticised for failing to deliver more

OL,11,Fis also a Blue Badge holder, wrote to
OL,12,Fthe Infrastructure Minister Andy Jehan
OL,13,Fsaying she was "disappointed at the
OL,14,Flack of action".
OL,16,FAdditional spaces and other access

OL,6,FThere are around 5,000 Blue Badge
OL,7,Fholders in Jersey although there are
OL,8,Fonly around 100 dedicated parking
OL,9,Fspaces.
OL,11,FDee Michoux, a Blue Badge holder, says
OL,12,Fshe normally avoids travelling into
OL,13,Ftown due to the lack of parking spaces
OL,14,Favailable.
OL,16,FShe explains: "With the town becoming
OL,17,Fa one-way system, it's not making it
OL,18,Fany easier for us disabled people
OL,19,Fanyway.

OL,6,F"We're pretty much second-class
OL,7,Fcitizens. They'll take the spaces from
OL,8,FBroad Street and put them into Harreck
OL,9,FStreet but realistically people have

OL,11,Fin the first place."
OL,13,FIn response, Infrastructure Minister
OL,14,FAndy Jehan says he walked around St
OL,15,FHelier with Constable Simon Crowcroft
OL,16,Fin September and has now "identified a

OL,18,FBlue Badge holder".
