OL,6,FTen rare fruit bats have died at
OL,7,FJersey Zoo following an outbreak of
OL,8,Finfection in the roost.
OL,10,FInitial tests have indicated that it
OL,11,Fis due to a bacterium called
OL,12,Fpasteurella multocida, which ITV News
OL,13,Funderstands can live in the species
OL,14,Fwithout leading to disease but may
OL,15,Falso cause serious issues if it enters

OL,18,FThe Zoo says the reasons why this
OL,19,Fchange might happen are complex and
OL,20,Fpoorly understood globally.

OL,6,FHowever, its Head Vet Allan Muir
OL,7,Fbelieves "the social stress resulting
OL,8,Ffrom removing a group of 12 animals
OL,9,Ffor export to France may have prompted
OL,10,Fthe disease outbreak".
OL,12,FThe bat enclosure has been closed,
OL,13,Fwith the remaining animals placed in
OL,14,Fseparate areas to ensure the colony's
OL,15,Fsafety while further tests are carried

OL,18,FThey have all been treated with
