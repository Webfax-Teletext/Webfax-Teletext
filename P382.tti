OL,6,FAn online safety event has revealed
OL,7,Fthe shocking impact internet trends
OL,8,Fhave on children's behaviour in Jersey.
OL,10,FAt a meeting at Victoria College,
OL,11,Fparents were shown examples of bad
OL,12,Fbehaviour that included children
OL,13,Fsharing explicit images on social
OL,14,Fmedia groups and making threats of a
OL,15,Fsexual nature.
OL,17,FOne child even threw themselves from a
OL,18,Fmoving car when their device was taken
OL,19,Faway, with another boy asking whether
OL,20,Fit was normal to choke women.

OL,6,FFellow parent and author Douglas
OL,7,FKruger has extensively researched the
OL,8,Fpsychology concerning online addiction.
OL,10,FHe said: "Perhaps one of the most
OL,11,Fconcerning things is that the devices
OL,12,Flearn our behaviour, so it's not just
OL,13,Fthat the device is addictive, it's
OL,14,Falso that the device becomes more
OL,15,Faddictive over time. It learns what
OL,16,Fthe child enjoys and provides more of
OL,17,Fit.

OL,6,F"One small element of hope is that the
OL,7,Fmind is infinitely malleable. It
OL,8,Fgrows, it changes, it morphs - but it
OL,9,Fdoes so less after the age of 24. You
OL,10,Fcan recover the neuro damage done by
OL,11,Fthese screens, but first, you have to
