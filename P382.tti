OL,6,FThe mother of a 23-year-old medical
OL,7,Fstudent from Jersey who needed surgery
OL,8,Fto shorten all four of her limbs after
OL,9,Fa severe infection is warning others
OL,10,Fabout the signs of sepsis.
OL,12,FJo Gorrod says her daughter Lily
OL,13,FMcGarry, who studies at Cardiff
OL,14,FUniversity, initially had symptoms
OL,15,Fwhich were dismissed by a 111 NHS call
OL,16,Fhandler as flu, but it turned out to
OL,17,Fbe much more serious.
OL,19,FJo explains: "What is devastating
OL,20,Fabout meningococcal is how quickly
OL,21,Fthings come on.
