OL,6,FReflecting on that period, Sir
OL,7,FNicholas says: "There was constant
OL,8,Fworry throughout the war as to what
OL,9,Fwas to be done; how the Channel
OL,10,FIslands were and whether it was worth
OL,11,Ftrying to retake them, but I think
OL,12,FJersey comes out of it triumphantly,
OL,13,Fpersonally.
OL,15,F"He would have loved Liberation
OL,16,Fbecause he loved celebration - he
OL,17,Fwould have loved it because he greatly
OL,18,Fbelieved that if you don't know the
OL,19,Flessons of history, you're bound to
OL,20,Fget them wrong again.
