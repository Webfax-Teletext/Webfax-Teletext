OL,6,FThe star of the modern re-imagining of
OL,7,FBergerac has said he does not believe
OL,8,Fthe series could be set anywhere other
OL,9,Fthan Jersey.
OL,11,FDamien Molony, who plays iconic island
OL,12,Fdetective Jim Bergerac in the reboot,
OL,13,Freflected on the importance of the
OL,14,Fsetting in conversation with his
OL,15,Fpredecessor John Nettles.
OL,17,FHe explained: "The setting is a

OL,7,Fthere's an added tension for the

OL,11,FNettles agreed, adding the island's
OL,12,Fsmall size also plays a role.
OL,14,FHe recalled: "I do remember John
OL,15,FSessions saying to me, 'I don't know
OL,16,Fwhy you bother to chase all the
OL,17,Fthieves in Jersey. Why don't you just
