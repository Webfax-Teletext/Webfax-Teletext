OL,6,FSo-called Operation Lavender took
OL,7,Fpolice and financial experts more than
OL,8,Ffive years to investigate.
OL,10,FJersey's Royal Court was told how Mr
OL,11,FJeanne, the former General Manager of
OL,12,Finsurance company Jersey Mutual, stole
OL,13,Ffrom his employer to fund a gambling
OL,14,Faddiction and to pay off a loan on his
OL,15,Fproperty in Spain.
OL,17,FThe court heard how his position meant
OL,18,Fhe had "complete authority over
OL,19,Fcheques and paying in books" and was
OL,20,Fable to divert funds into his own
OL,21,Faccounts.

OL,6,FIt was, said the prosecution, a "gross
OL,7,Fbreach of trust" and Mr Jeanne had
OL,8,Ftreated the company as his "own
OL,9,Fpersonal credit facility".
OL,11,FMr Jeanne's lawyer said his client
OL,12,Ffelt profound remorse.
OL,14,FThe co-accused, Mr Timms, had owned
OL,15,Fone of the leading creative and
OL,16,Fmarketing companies in Jersey.
OL,18,FHe made false invoices which helped to
