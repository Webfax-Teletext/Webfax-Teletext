OL,13,Ftheir cats or they could face a #500

OL,6,FThere is no such law currently in the

OL,8,FChief Veterinary Officer says they are
OL,9,Fconsidering making it mandatory on the
OL,10,Fisland.
OL,12,FMicrochips are small devices that are
OL,13,Finjected into pets, carrying the
OL,14,Fpersonal data of their owners so they
OL,15,Fcan be reunited easily.

OL,19,Fafter his details were scanned on his

OL,11,FShe added that despite Jersey being a

OL,13,Fmissing for months.
OL,15,FThe JSPCA say it regularly has cats
