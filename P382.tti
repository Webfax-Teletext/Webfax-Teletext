OL,6,FThe Constable of St Helier, Simon
OL,7,FCrowcroft, has been pushing for city
OL,8,Fstatus since 2001, but admits the idea
OL,9,Fhasn't gained much traction: "It's not
OL,10,Fa case perhaps of people opposing it
OL,11,Fbut certainly when I've taken
OL,12,Fsoundings in the past, there just
OL,13,Fhasn't been much enthusiasm.
OL,15,F"Maybe there have been other things
OL,16,Fgoing on which are a more pressing
OL,17,Fconcern to residents."

OL,3,CShould the Channel Islands apply to

OL,6,FBut he does believe the island could
OL,7,Fbenefit from having a city: "It's
OL,8,Fabout bringing more status, more
OL,9,Freputation and more civic pride to the

OL,12,FHowever, in Guernsey, there does not
OL,13,Fappear to be much appetite for turning
OL,14,FSt Peter Port into a city.
OL,16,FThe town's Constable Jenny Tasker
OL,17,Fsaid: "We discussed it in the douzaine
OL,18,Fand we felt that it was totally

OL,20,Fseveral reasons.

OL,6,F"We are a small town on a beautiful
OL,7,Fisland, being a city would make
OL,8,Fvarious demands on us with perhaps
OL,9,Ffinancial implications which we don't

OL,12,FThe application process is available
OL,13,Fevery 10 years in line with the
OL,14,Fmonarch's jubilee, whereby applicants
OL,15,Fcan bid for free to be granted the

OL,6,FHistorically, cities were areas with
OL,7,Fcathedrals, but having one is no
OL,8,Flonger a requirement.
OL,10,FBirmingham was the first town to be
OL,11,Fgiven the city title, despite not

OL,14,FClaire Wells is Douglas City Council
