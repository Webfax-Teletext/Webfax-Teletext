OL,3,CWhy plummeting temperatures this week
OL,4,Care NOT down to the Polar Vortex
OL,6,FFor much of the past week,
OL,7,Fsoutheasterly winds have been drawing
OL,8,Fmild Mediterranean air in across the
OL,9,FUK which, coupled with sunny skies,
OL,10,Fhave allowed temperature to rise well
OL,11,Fabove the seasonal average.
OL,13,FThis week however, we see a change in
OL,14,Fthat wind direction thanks to low
OL,15,Fpressure sitting to the east and high
OL,16,Fpressure to the west. This creates a
OL,17,Fnortherly wind that brings Arctic air
OL,18,Fstraight down from the north. In air
OL,19,Fthis chilly, any showers will readily
OL,20,Fturn to sleet and snow across the
OL,21,Fhigher ground in the north.

OL,18,FActually no - despite what some

OL,6,FBeneath the Polar Vortex, a little
OL,7,Fcloser to the earth lies the Polar Jet
OL,8,FStream - around 6 miles above the
OL,9,Fearth. Exactly like the Jet Stream
OL,10,Fthat we often talk about, the Polar
OL,11,FJet Stream is also a narrow, fast
OL,12,Fmoving current of wind and this one
OL,13,Ftypically marks the boundary between
OL,14,Fcold polar air and the warmer air that
OL,15,Ftends to sit over us.

OL,4,Care NOT down to the Polar Vortex
OL,6,FOccasionally (every few years), a
OL,7,Fphenomenon called Sudden Stratospheric
OL,8,FWarming (SSW) occurs. Put most simply,
OL,9,Fthis is essentially a disturbance in
OL,10,Fthe upper atmosphere which causes a
OL,11,F'wobble' in the usual flow of the
OL,12,FPolar Jet, which can result in what is
OL,13,Fknown as the 'collapse of the Polar
OL,14,FVortex' - essentially, extremely cold,
OL,15,FArctic air, flowing southwards across
OL,16,Fthe UK. (It's highly likely that the
OL,17,F2018 'Beast From the East' was the
OL,18,Fresult of the collapse of the Polar
OL,19,FVortex.)

OL,6,FSSW is very often far less dramatic
OL,7,Fthough. So although Met Office
OL,8,Fforecasters anticipate an 80% chance
OL,9,Fof SSW occurring by the middle of the

OL,11,Fimpacts on weather in the UK toward
OL,12,Fthe end of March, fear mongering of
