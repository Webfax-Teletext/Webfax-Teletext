OL,7,FNext Friday's meeting in Alaska
OL,8,Fpromises to be a critical moment in
OL,9,FDonald Trump's second term.
OL,11,FAfter months of promises and false
OL,12,Fhope, the White House is offering
OL,13,Frenewed optimism that the war in
OL,14,FUkraine can be brought to a close.
OL,16,FDespite frequent phone calls between
OL,17,Fthe two men, sometimes lasting hours,
OL,18,Fthis will be the first time Russian
OL,19,FPresident Vladimir Putin and Trump
OL,20,Fhave met face-to-face since 2018.

OL,7,FTrump has already suggested a
OL,8,Fcompromise on land might be on the
OL,9,Ftable, saying any deal could include
OL,10,F"some swapping of territories," but
OL,11,FRussia has long claimed it would only
OL,12,Faccept Ukraine's handing over of all
OL,13,Ffour Oblasts or provinces in the east.
OL,15,FIt already controls mostly two of
OL,16,Fthem, Donetsk and Luhansk, in the
OL,17,FDonbas. But Putin only has a partial
OL,18,Fgrip on the other two, Kherson and
OL,19,FZaporizhzhia.

OL,7,FIf, finally, Putin really is willing

OL,10,FUkraine will accept a deal which it
OL,11,Fwould rule out NATO membership.

OL,14,Fthat is the point of a peace treaty;
