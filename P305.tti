OL,6,FSo the Ukraine Russia peace talks are
OL,7,Fgetting underway in Istanbul.
OL,9,FThey are the first direct negotiations
OL,10,Fsince the early days of this dreadful
OL,11,Fwar, but they are not the moment in
OL,12,Fhistory some had hoped.
OL,14,FThere's only one decision maker in
OL,15,FRussia and though he proposed the
OL,16,Ftalks, he won't be present.
OL,18,FPresident Putin will not be part of
OL,19,Fthe delegation and will not be meeting
OL,20,Fhis Ukrainian counterpart on the banks
OL,21,Fof the Bosphorus.

OL,11,FLet's not forget Zelenskyy is a man he

OL,15,FFor his part, Zelenskyy, keen not to

OL,3,CWhat can we expect from the Ukraine

OL,6,FThis has been a good week for Putin,

OL,9,Ftalks for peace that everyone
OL,10,Fresponded to, he avoided the huge
