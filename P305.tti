OL,6,FThe parents of ten-year-old Matilda,
OL,7,Fwho was the youngest victim of the
OL,8,FBondi Beach attack, have spoken to ITV
OL,9,FNews Asia Correspondent Debi Edward.
OL,11,FMatilda's parents wanted us to meet
OL,12,FNatasha Willemsen; they believe if it
OL,13,Fwasn't for 'Tash' as they fondly call
OL,14,Fher, they would be mourning both of
OL,15,Ftheir daughters.

OL,6,FOn December 14 last year, when two
OL,7,Fterrorists opened fire on a Hanukkah
OL,8,Fcelebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach,
OL,9,FMatilda and her little sister Summer
OL,10,Fhad gone to see the animals at a
OL,11,Fpetting zoo set up at the event.
OL,13,FThey weren't far from their parents,
OL,14,Fbut when the shooting started, the
OL,15,Fpark felt like a warzone, and they
OL,16,Fcouldn't reach them.
OL,18,FTheir dad, Michael, could hear and
OL,19,Ffeel bullets raining down on the area,
OL,20,Fthen he heard a cry and saw Matilda.
