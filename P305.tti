OL,7,FMr Merricks pointed to a European
OL,8,FCommission ruling in 2007 that
OL,9,FMastercard had, since 1992, been
OL,10,Finfringing competition law by charging
OL,11,Fretailers to take payments via
OL,12,FMastercard in what they called
OL,13,F"multilateral interchange fees".
OL,15,FThese fees were paid by retailers, not
OL,16,Fconsumers, but he alleged that around
OL,17,F46 million shoppers had been affected
OL,18,Fby this as shops passed these fees
OL,19,Fonto consumers through higher prices.
