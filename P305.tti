OL,6,FNigel Farage has hit back at Jess
OL,7,FPhillips after she suggested the
OL,8,FReform UK leader's pledge to scrap the
OL,9,FOnline Safety Act would empower
OL,10,F"modern-day Jimmy Saviles".
OL,12,FSpeaking at a press conference on
OL,13,FMonday, Farage said the comments were
OL,14,F"sinking to the gutter of politics."
OL,16,FIt comes after Technology Secretary
OL,17,FPeter Kyle said Farage was putting
OL,18,Fhimself on the side of "extreme
OL,19,Fpornographers" and people like Savile
OL,20,Fby opposing the law.
