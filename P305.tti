OL,9,Fbe a chance to catch them again this
OL,10,Fweekend, according to the Met Office.
OL,12,FThe Northern Lights could put on a
OL,13,Fshow with recent solar flares creating
OL,14,Fthe potential for a "breathtaking"
OL,15,Fdisplay, it said.
OL,17,FThe display, also known as aurora
OL,18,Fborealis, is most likely to be visible
OL,19,Fin Scotland, Northern Ireland and
OL,20,Fnorthern England over the weekend.

OL,6,FProf Dalla said: "This strong

OL,8,Ftaking displays of the Northern Lights.
OL,10,F"If we get a repeat of the solar

OL,12,Fpotentially see more spell-bounding

OL,15,FDr Steph Yardley, a space scientist at

OL,17,Fregion of the Sun which has been
OL,18,Fproducing the flares, has been
