OL,6,FHeriot-Watt University has said its
OL,7,F"groundbreaking technology" that could
OL,8,F"revolutionise how eczema is diagnosed
OL,9,Fand treated" has received more than
OL,10,F#475,000 to move into clinical
OL,11,Fresearch.
OL,13,FThe university in Edinburgh said the
OL,14,Fvibroacoustic sensor could end "years
OL,15,Fof suffering for millions of patients
OL,16,Facross the UK".
OL,18,FThe device measures material changes
OL,19,Fin each layer of skin using small
OL,20,Fvibrations on the surface to detect
OL,21,Fchanges in tissue stiffness and fluid.
