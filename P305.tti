OL,11,FWe've got rain moving into southern

OL,6,FExpect the steadiest snow to be
OL,7,Ffalling across higher ground in these
OL,8,Fareas - notably the Welsh mountains
OL,9,Fand the Pennines. There'll be snow
OL,10,Fblowing across the higher routes with
OL,11,Fa brisk, bitter easterly wind. With
OL,12,Fthe snow there'll be the risk of
OL,13,Fchallenging conditions for those
OL,14,Fhaving to travel.
OL,16,FThe snow risk will last around 12
OL,17,Fhours at most, it's very transient,
OL,18,Ffor the majority it's a brief snowy,
OL,19,Fwintry spell. Much of the snow will
OL,20,Fturn to sleet then rain within a few
