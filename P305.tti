OL,7,Fthe Chinese Government imposed its

OL,6,FThere are two reasons behind the less-
OL,7,Fthan-proportionate response from
OL,8,FChina. The first is that due to the
OL,9,Ftrade surplus, it is running with the
OL,10,FUS, there aren't so many targets it
OL,11,Fcan hit. The second reason appears to
OL,12,Fbe a reluctance to trigger a full-

OL,6,FThe fact that the tariffs imposed by
OL,7,Fthe Trump administration were 10% and
OL,8,Fnot any higher has led to the belief
OL,9,Fthat the US President might be open to
OL,10,Fa negotiation. He's currently got his
OL,11,Fteam assessing a trade deal the two
OL,12,Fcountries had agreed on, but failed to
OL,13,Fimplement, during his first term. He
OL,14,Falso still has TikTok on the chopping
OL,15,Fblock.
OL,17,FAlthough the tariffs imposed by China
OL,18,Fwere somewhat measured, Donald Trump
OL,19,Fhas been given some food for thought
OL,20,Fwith the raft of export controls China
OL,21,Fhas placed on critical minerals.
