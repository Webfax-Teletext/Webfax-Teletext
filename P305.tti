OL,6,FNigel Farage has a point.
OL,8,FImmigration was at the heart of the
OL,9,FBrexit debate. A desire to control the
OL,10,Fnumber of people arriving in the UK is
OL,11,Fwhat drove the vote to leave the EU.
OL,13,FThe fact which got lost in the heat of

OL,15,Fof the immigration was not from the
OL,16,FEU. Today that's even truer.
