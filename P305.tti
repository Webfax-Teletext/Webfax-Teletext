OL,4,Cmemorial plaque after hurricane

OL,7,FThe Schiller family, of Finchley, had
OL,8,Fthe commemorative plaque put up at
OL,9,Ftheir son's favourite spot on holiday
OL,10,Fon a pier in Anna Maria Island,
OL,11,FFlorida, after Max died unexpectedly
OL,12,Faged 10 in 2017.
OL,14,FWhen Hurricane Milton hit the US State
OL,15,Flast week, the powerful tides
OL,16,Fcompletely destroyed the pier and took
OL,17,FMax's plaque with it.
OL,19,FIt was one of the places the family,
OL,20,Fwho often holiday to the area, could
OL,21,Fgo to feel connected to Max.
