OL,6,FThe Conservative Party chairman has
OL,7,Frepeatedly refused to answer questions
OL,8,Fabout his selection as a Parliamentary
OL,9,Fcandidate, leading a Tory aide to step
OL,10,Fin and threaten to cut the interview.
OL,12,FRichard Holden was asked at least four
OL,13,Ftimes whether his selection to a safe
OL,14,Fseat hundreds of miles from his
OL,15,Fprevious constituency amounted to a
OL,16,F"stitch-up", but each time refused to
OL,17,Fanswer.

OL,10,Finterviewer Jon Craig said: "I'm going

OL,13,FEventually an off-camera aide stood

OL,15,Fhis line of questioning "wasn't

OL,18,FThe interview was part of a pool
