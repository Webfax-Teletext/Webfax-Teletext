OL,6,FThe news kept coming from Israel and
OL,7,FGaza.
OL,9,FOver the course of twelve hours
OL,10,Fyesterday, a series of developments
OL,11,Fappeared to push the entire region
OL,12,Ftowards a state of heightened fear,
OL,13,Fthen fresh hope, then back again.
OL,15,FThe morning after, it is now clear

OL,17,Fwere as consequential as they appeared

OL,13,FMonday afternoon's wave of unexpected

OL,15,Fannouncement by Hamas that it had
OL,16,Faccepted a ceasefire deal.
OL,18,FThere were small celebrations in the
