OL,6,FCurrently, independent schools do not
OL,7,Fhave to charge 20% VAT on their fees
OL,8,Fbecause there is an exemption for the
OL,9,Fsupply of education.
OL,11,FMr Berger said Deutsche Schule London,
OL,12,Fbased in Richmond, had around 900
OL,13,Fpupils and "between 20 and 25 per cent
OL,14,Fmight be obliged to leave the school"
OL,15,Fif the change was introduced.
OL,17,FHe added: "The German state covers 30
OL,18,Fper cent of the costs of the school
OL,19,Fand 50 per cent of the investment, so
OL,20,Fthere is a lot of state funding that
