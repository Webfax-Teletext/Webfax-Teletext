OL,6,FThe union's general secretary, Mick
OL,7,FWhelan, said strike action was
OL,8,Fnecessary because "we haven't had a
OL,9,Fpay rise for half a decade".
OL,11,FHe said the union's primary issues
OL,12,Fwere with the "bad faith" train
OL,13,Foperators who refuse to negotiate
OL,14,Fbecause of "political dogma" and the
OL,15,Fgovernment who "don't care".
OL,17,FThe union rejected an 8% offer last

OL,19,Fvoting to take strike action last
