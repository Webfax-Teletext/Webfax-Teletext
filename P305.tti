OL,8,Faccused of "regularly" paying women,
OL,9,Fincluding a 17-year-old girl, for sex
OL,10,Fand purchasing and using illicit
OL,11,Fdrugs, all while serving in Congress.
OL,13,FThe 37-page report by the bipartisan
OL,14,Fethics committee includes explicit
OL,15,Fdetails of sex-filled parties and
OL,16,Fholidays that Gaetz, now 42, took part
OL,17,Fin.
OL,19,FThe findings conclude that he violated
OL,20,Fmultiple state laws related to sexual
OL,21,Fmisconduct while in office.
