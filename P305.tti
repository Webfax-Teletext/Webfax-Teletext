OL,6,FWildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta
OL,7,Fsaid the humpback whale was likely
OL,8,Flunge-feeding on krill or fish at the
OL,9,Ftime, and the kayaker was in its way.
OL,11,F"The gentleman happened to be very
OL,12,Fclose to the whale that was just going
OL,13,Fabout feeding behaviour. The man was
OL,14,Fnot swallowed," she said.
OL,16,F"These animals are not targeting human-

OL,18,Fequipment to do what they need to do
OL,19,Fin order to devour a human," she said,
OL,20,Fpointing to their narrow oesophagus
OL,21,Fand lack of teeth.
