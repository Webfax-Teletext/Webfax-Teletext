OL,5,C'problematic' ` ASA
OL,7,FA TV ad for Sanex shower gel has been
OL,8,Fbanned for reinforcing the offensive
OL,9,Fracial stereotype that black skin was
OL,10,F"problematic" and that white skin was
OL,11,F"superior", a watchdog has said.
OL,13,FThe Advertising Standards Authority
OL,14,F(ASA) ruled the ad must not appear
OL,15,Fagain after investigating two
OL,16,Fcomplaints that it perpetuated
OL,17,Fnegative stereotypes about people with
OL,18,Fdarker skin tones.

OL,16,FAlongside scenes of a white woman
