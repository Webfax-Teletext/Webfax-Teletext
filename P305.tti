OL,6,FPrior to Roe's filing, an anonymous
OL,7,Fcelebrity plaintiff known as "John
OL,8,FDoe", now revealed to be Brooks, filed
OL,9,Fa complaint which tried to block Roe
OL,10,Ffrom publicly repeating the
OL,11,Fallegations and denied the claims.
OL,13,FAccording to the lawsuit, Roe started
OL,14,Fdoing hair and make-up for Brook in
OL,15,F2017 and was first hired to do hair
OL,16,Fand make-up for his wife, Trisha
OL,17,FYearwood, in 1999.
OL,19,FThe lawsuit alleges that in 2019
OL,20,FBrooks asked her to travel with him by
OL,21,Fprivate jet to Los Angeles.

OL,6,F"Usually there were others on Brooks'
