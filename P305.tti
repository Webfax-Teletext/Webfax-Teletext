OL,7,FIn opening statements on Wednesday,
OL,8,Fprosecutors accused the actor of
OL,9,Fplaying "make-believe with a real
OL,10,Fgun," while the defence team said the
OL,11,Fgun was deemed "cold," meaning it had
OL,12,Fbeen checked and was safe.
OL,14,FThe trial continued on Thursday, with
OL,15,Fdefence attorney Alex Spiro arguing
OL,16,Fthat the live ammunition casings found
OL,17,Fon the set were hard to distinguish
OL,18,Ffrom dummy ones.
