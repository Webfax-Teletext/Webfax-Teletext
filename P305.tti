OL,6,FIt is a great irony that legal
OL,7,Fdownfall is unrelated to the many

OL,9,Fin the final days of his presidency.
OL,10,FThis case wasn't about the attempted

OL,13,FThis wasn't about keeping secret

OL,6,FAmerican voters know Trump. Most have
OL,7,Flived through his first wild
OL,8,Fpresidency. Their views are entrenched
OL,9,Fand often visceral. There are no
OL,10,Fsurprises left.
OL,12,FIt is entirely likely that the guilty
OL,13,Fverdict will change the votes of only
OL,14,Fa small fraction of the electorate.
OL,15,FPolling suggests that only 4% of his
OL,16,Fsupporters will withdraw their backing
OL,17,Ffor him.
OL,19,FBut this is certain to be a close
OL,20,Felection, decided by a small number of
OL,21,Fpeople in just six battleground states.
