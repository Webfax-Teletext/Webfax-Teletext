OL,7,FThe co-writer of Virginia Giuffre's
OL,8,Fmemoir has said it would be a mistake
OL,9,Fto think "the fetishisation of young
OL,10,Fgirls" died with Jeffrey Epstein, as
OL,11,Fshe detailed how Prince Andrew could
OL,12,Fstill help with the investigation.
OL,14,FSpeaking to ITV News, Amy Wallace, who
OL,15,Fhelped write the book, said she had
OL,16,F"no doubt" about the truth of the
OL,17,Fallegations Giuffre made about the
OL,18,Fprince in it.

OL,16,FThe memoir is being published

OL,7,FMs Wallace welcomed the decision for

OL,14,FWallace said: "You know Prince Andrew
