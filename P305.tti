OL,6,FLeo Ross was just 12 years old when he
OL,7,Fwas stabbed in the Hall Green area of
OL,8,FBirmingham in January 2025.
OL,10,FA 15-year-old teenager, who was 14 at
OL,11,Fthe time and cannot be identified
OL,12,Fbecause of his age, has pleaded guilty
OL,13,Fto the murder. He didn't know Leo.
OL,15,FThe mother of Leo's best friend, Max,
OL,16,Ftold ITV News that his death has left
OL,17,Fa "massive void".
OL,19,FTammy Rogers said: "He was very
OL,20,Finquisitive, he loved everything and
OL,21,Fhe was so intellectual.

OL,6,F"If he took a liking to something, he
OL,7,Fwent into it really deep, like

OL,9,FWe'd go to the zoo and he'd know

OL,12,F"He was a chatterbox. He'd be talking

OL,18,FLeo and Max met at school, and Tammy
