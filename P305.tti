OL,5,FThis conference was the first time
OL,6,FReform UK's supporters had gathered
OL,7,Fsince the party secured more than four
OL,8,Fmillion votes - and five MPs - in
OL,9,FJuly's election. It was a chance for
OL,10,Fofficials, volunteers and its
OL,11,Fpoliticians to celebrate. And
OL,12,Fcelebrate they did.
OL,14,FDay one of the conference culminated
OL,15,Fin what one Reform source promised
OL,16,Fwould be "the biggest drinking session
OL,17,Fin British political history." It
OL,18,Ffeatured karaoke from Nigel Farage -
OL,19,Fhilarious or horrifying depending on
OL,20,Fyour view.

OL,5,FBefore that, each of the party's new
OL,6,FMPs spoke to an adoring crowd of four
OL,7,Fthousand people. The Ashfield MP Lee
OL,8,FAnderson got the biggest laughs. Nigel
OL,9,FFarage (saving his singing until
OL,10,Flater) got the biggest cheers.
OL,12,FThe speeches weren't much different
OL,13,Ffrom what we heard during the general
OL,14,Felection a few months earlier. But
OL,15,Fnobody seemed to notice or care.
OL,16,F"We're playing the hits," said a
OL,17,Fsenior Reform source.

OL,10,FDay two of the conference was more low-
OL,11,Fprofile but far more significant. As
OL,12,Fdelegates nursed their hangovers, they
OL,13,Fapproved a new constitution (a handful
OL,14,Fof people in the hall opposed it, not
OL,15,Fthat the vote had any real meaning).
OL,16,FIt means Nigel Farage will, in time,
OL,17,Fgive up his controlling stake in the
OL,18,Fparty, giving members the ability to
OL,19,Fremove him as leader.

OL,5,FFarage told ITV News that "loopy" and
OL,6,F"extremely racist" Reform UK
OL,7,Fcandidates caused his party "enormous
OL,8,Fdamage" at the last election. "And
OL,9,Fprobably rightly so," he added. For

OL,11,F"professionalise" the party, setting

OL,6,Fthe Liberal Democrats campaigning
OL,7,Ftactics, and hopes members will leave
OL,8,Fthis conference ready to knock on

OL,14,FThat is the first staging post over
