OL,6,FIn an exclusive interview with ITV

OL,9,F"There's a lot of levers you can pull

OL,13,F"The last Labour government took

OL,15,FThe next Labour government will do the
OL,16,Fsame."
OL,18,FWhen asked if the policy would be gone
OL,19,Fwithin the next five years, she said:
OL,20,F"That's our plan, but we don't want to
OL,21,Fstart making commitments."

OL,8,Faxed.
OL,10,FThe two-child limit was introduced
OL,11,Funder the Conservative Government in
OL,12,F2017, and restricts Child Tax Credit
