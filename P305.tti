OL,7,FRowley has called for the creation of
OL,8,Fmega forces in England, to update a
OL,9,Fsystem that has not 'been fit for

OL,12,FSir Mark said bigger and fewer forces
OL,13,Fwould mean officers would be able to
OL,14,Fshare modern technology and it would
OL,15,Freduce "expensive" governance and
OL,16,Fsupport services.
OL,18,FHe said it would be the "first serious
OL,19,Freform of our policing model in over
OL,20,F60 years".

OL,11,Fas the cost of borrowing spirals.
OL,13,FSome have increasingly relied on

OL,15,Fexpected to rise by 49% in the next

OL,18,F"Forces' borrowing costs have been
