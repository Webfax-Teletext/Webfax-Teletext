OL,6,FAn employment tribunal has ruled that
OL,7,FNext failed to demonstrate that the
OL,8,Flower pay for sales consultants
OL,9,Fcompared to warehouse workers was not
OL,10,Fdue to sex discrimination, affecting
OL,11,F3,540 claimants.
OL,13,FThe tribunal examined that between
OL,14,F2012 and 2023, 77.5% of retail
OL,15,Fconsultants at the retailer were
OL,16,Ffemale, and 52.75% of warehouse
