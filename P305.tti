OL,6,FA patient in the UK has received a new
OL,7,Ftherapy for Huntington's disease,
OL,8,Fwhich experts hope could slow
OL,9,Fprogression of the fatal illness.
OL,11,FHuntington's is an inherited condition
OL,12,Fthat is caused by a defect in a
OL,13,Fparticular gene. This is responsible
OL,14,Ffor making a protein which does not
OL,15,Fwork properly in people with the
OL,16,Fdisease.
OL,18,FOver many years, this "mutant" protein
OL,19,Fforms clumps in brain cells and causes
OL,20,Fthem to become damaged and die.
