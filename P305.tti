OL,6,FA high-tech device that looks like a
OL,7,Fnormal spoon is being developed by
OL,8,Fresearchers to help combat eating and
OL,9,Fdrinking difficulties in people with
OL,10,Fdementia.
OL,12,FKnown as Tasty Spoon, the device uses
OL,13,Felectrostimulation to enhance the
OL,14,Fflavour of foods for patients
OL,15,Fexperiencing a loss of taste.
OL,17,FPeople with dementia often have issues
OL,18,Fwith eating and drinking due to
OL,19,Fsymptoms like memory loss, not being
OL,20,Fable to recognise food, and a
OL,21,Fdecreased sense of smell and taste.
