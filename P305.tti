OL,6,FPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said:
OL,7,F"From the broken NHS, flatlining

OL,11,Finherited a country that simply isn't

OL,14,F"But today we've set out a plan to fix
OL,15,Fthis. A plan that tackles the biggest
OL,16,Fdrivers of unemployment and inactivity
OL,17,Fand gives young people their future
OL,18,Fback through real, meaningful change
OL,19,Finstead of empty rhetoric and sticking
