OL,8,Fsent by Peter Mandelson to the
OL,9,Fconvicted billionaire paedophile
OL,10,FJeffrey Epstein and when.
OL,12,FOn Monday, September 8, Bloomberg
OL,13,FNews, which had obtained more than 100
OL,14,Femails between Mandelson and Epstein,
OL,15,Fsent a letter to the Foreign Office
OL,16,Fcontaining excerpts of the emails and
OL,17,Fasking a series of questions.
OL,19,FThese excerpts are what appeared on
OL,20,Fthe Sun Newspaper's website shortly
OL,21,Fbefore 5pm on Wednesday, September 10.
