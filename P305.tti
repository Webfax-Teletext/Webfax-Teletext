OL,6,FOfgem's announcement that it will
OL,7,Fincrease the energy price cap this
OL,8,Fwinter has stirred concerns for
OL,9,Fmillions of Britons about how they
OL,10,Fwill cope once again with soaring
OL,11,Fenergy bills.
OL,13,FExperts have warned that pensioners,
OL,14,Fin particular, are at risk of being
OL,15,Funable to sufficiently heat their
OL,16,Fhomes when temperatures drop.
