OL,6,FIt has emerged that the cargo vessel
OL,7,Fwas carrying 15 containers of Sodium
OL,8,FCyanide - which releases toxic,
OL,9,Fflammable hydrogen cyanide gas when it

OL,12,FIt is not yet clear whether the

OL,14,Fbut on Monday evening, the Coastguard
OL,15,Fsaid both vessels remained on fire.
OL,17,FIt has also been confirmed the tanker
OL,18,F- the Stena Immaculate - was carrying

OL,6,FProfessor Mark Sephton, Professor of
