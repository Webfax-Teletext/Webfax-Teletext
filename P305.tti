OL,6,FThe Defence Secretary has said the
OL,7,FUK's armed forces are not "ready to
OL,8,Ffight" a war and need to be "more
OL,9,Feffective" in deterring future
OL,10,Faggression against Nato.
OL,12,FJohn Healey told Politico that the UK
OL,13,Fhad become "very skilled and ready to
OL,14,Fconduct military operations", but
OL,15,Fneeded to be "ready to fight" in order
OL,16,Fto deter other nations.
OL,18,FHe added that ministers found the
OL,19,Fstate of the armed forces was "far
OL,20,Fworse than we thought" after Labour
OL,21,Fentered Government in July.

OL,6,FWhen asked about comments by the head
OL,7,Fof the Army, General Sir Roly Walker,
OL,8,Fthat the UK must be ready to fight a
OL,9,Fwar in three years, Mr Healey said:
OL,10,F"The UK, in keeping with many other
OL,11,Fnations, has essentially become very
OL,12,Fskilled and ready to conduct military
OL,13,Foperations.
OL,15,F"What we've not been ready to do is to
OL,16,Ffight. And unless we are ready to
OL,17,Ffight, we are not in a shape to deter."
OL,19,FHe added that this was "at the heart"
OL,20,Fof thinking within Nato.
