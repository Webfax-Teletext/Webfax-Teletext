OL,11,FThe first would reward work and would

OL,14,FThe second would do the same, but
OL,15,Fwould also hand additional cash to

OL,6,FInevitably therefore cutting the rate
OL,7,Fof income tax costs #2bn a year more
OL,8,Fthan cutting NI for each penny
OL,9,Freduction. So bribing more potential

OL,12,FMy hunch, as I said , is he'll do a
OL,13,Fpenny off each. But as of now, that is
OL,14,Fhow it smells rather than what I know.
OL,16,FWhat I know is that 2p in the pound is

OL,6,FTorsten Bell from the think tank the
OL,7,FResolution Foundation said in a post
OL,8,Fon X that Jeremy Hunt is "choosing a
OL,9,Ftotally new approach to the shape of
OL,10,Ftax policy".
OL,12,FHe compares Mr Hunt's tax policy to
OL,13,Fthat of former Chancellor George
OL,14,FOsborne, saying: "I think everyone who
OL,15,Fworks on tax policy will recognise
OL,16,Fthat Jeremy Hunt's is by far the
OL,17,Fbetter tax reform strategy - whatever
OL,18,Fthey think about whether the tax cuts
OL,19,Fcan be afforded in the current
OL,20,Fclimate."

OL,8,FThe Times' Political Editor Steven

OL,10,Ftomorrow cut employee national

OL,13,FThe distributional impact, i.e winners
