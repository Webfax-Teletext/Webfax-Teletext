OL,6,FHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has
OL,7,Fsaid expectant mothers should pay no
OL,8,F"attention whatsoever to what Donald
OL,9,FTrump says about medicine", after the
OL,10,FUS president claimed paracetamol use
OL,11,Fduring pregnancy was linked to autism.
OL,13,FTrump said there had been a "meteoric
OL,14,Frise" in cases of autism and suggested
OL,15,Fthat paracetamol, known by the brand
OL,16,Fname Tylenol in the United States, is
OL,17,Fa potential cause.
