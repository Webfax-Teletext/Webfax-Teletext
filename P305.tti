OL,6,FSimon Clarke, the festival director
OL,7,Fsaid: "It has become increasingly
OL,8,Fdifficult for independent festivals to
OL,9,Foperate in in the current climate. We
OL,10,Fknow we're not alone and many other
OL,11,Ffestivals are in a similar situation.
OL,13,F"It's a tough financial market out
OL,14,Fthere, it's tough so sell tickets
OL,15,Fbecause people haven't got the money
OL,16,Fand it's also tough to put events on
OL,17,Fbecause the cost of doing so is

OL,6,FCovid obviously dealt the festival
OL,7,Findustry a huge blow. One in six never
OL,8,Freturned after the pandemic. Those
OL,9,Fwhich did survive have struggled to
OL,10,Fbreak even ever since. Overall
OL,11,Foperational costs have risen by more

OL,14,Fputting on events much more expensive.

OL,6,FMany smaller festivals also lack the
OL,7,Fcash reserves to pay the production
OL,8,Fcosts up front. It is an industry
OL,9,Fwhich is hugely reliant on temporary
OL,10,Flabour and the leasing of equipment.
OL,11,FBrexit has restricted access for many
OL,12,Ffestival workers from Europe and made
OL,13,Fthe logistics pool smaller.
OL,15,FMany service providers also want
OL,16,Fpayment up front. However, if festival
OL,17,Fattendees leave it late to buy
OL,18,Ftickets, some organisers decide to
OL,19,Fcancel altogether rather than run at a
OL,20,Floss.

OL,6,FJohn Rostron, chief executive of AIF,
OL,7,Ftold ITV News: "As you come towards
