OL,6,FNow Donald Trump faces the 'mother of
OL,7,Fall decisions' on whether to drop a 15-
OL,8,Ftonne bomb on Iran in an attempt to
OL,9,Fend its nuclear programme, or whether
OL,10,Fhe will give a diplomatic push one
OL,11,Flast try.
OL,13,FThere is a significant part of his
OL,14,FRepublican Party which hates the idea
OL,15,Fof the US getting involved in another
OL,16,FMiddle East war. Donald Trump himself
OL,17,Fhas boasted how no conflicts have
OL,18,Fstarted under his Presidency. But his
OL,19,Fsocial media posts today are bellicose.

OL,7,F"We have complete and total control of

OL,9,Fexactly where the so-called 'Supreme
