OL,8,Fsweeping changes to the UK's energy

OL,11,Fface another rise in fuel costs this

OL,14,FChief executive David Buttress told
OL,15,Fthe PA news agency the Government
OL,16,Fshould introduce a social tariff,
OL,17,Fsomething which is already used in the

OL,7,FThe measure, which campaign groups
OL,8,Fhave proposed for several years, would
OL,9,Flikely take the form of a targeted

OL,11,Fcustomers, and could be below the
OL,12,Fprice of the cheapest available
OL,13,Fstandard energy tariff.
OL,15,FMr Buttress said: "A social tariff
OL,16,Fwould allow us to address the cost of
OL,17,Fenergy for the poorest in our
OL,18,Fcommunities in a way that means,
OL,19,Fcollectively, we could give them the
OL,20,Fprotection they need to get through
OL,21,Fthe winter months."
