OL,6,FThe largest coral in the world,
OL,7,Fmeasuring 32 metres long, has been
OL,8,Ffound in the Solomon Islands.
OL,10,FThe coral, which is visible from
OL,11,Fspace, is three times larger than the
OL,12,Fprevious record-breaker, and is
OL,13,Fbelieved to be about 300 years old.
OL,15,FIt is mostly brown but features
OL,16,Fsplashes of bright yellows, blues and
OL,17,Freds, and is covered with ripples of
OL,18,Fwaves, mirroring the ocean's surface.
