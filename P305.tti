OL,6,FHome Secretary Yvette Cooper claimed
OL,7,Fon Tuesday that many people are
OL,8,Fapplying for asylum after their
OL,9,Fstudies, despite "nothing changing" in
OL,10,Ftheir home country.
OL,12,F"People can stay after their
OL,13,Finternational student visa," Ms Cooper
OL,14,Fsaid. "They can then work in the UK
OL,15,Ffor another two years.
OL,17,F"We've seen instead around 15,000
OL,18,Fstudents applying for asylum at the
OL,19,Fend of their visa, even though for
OL,20,Fmany of them nothing had changed in
OL,21,Ftheir home country during that time."

OL,11,FHowever, Ms Cooper said the government

OL,15,FShe continued: "That's why we are
