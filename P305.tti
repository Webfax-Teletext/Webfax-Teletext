OL,9,Freached the pinnacle that is winning
OL,10,Fthe Nobel Peace Prize, his immediate

OL,6,FIt hasn't happened yet, but it seems
OL,7,Fhighly likely that the International
OL,8,FCriminal Court will agree to issue the
OL,9,Farrest warrants now being sought by
OL,10,Fthe chief prosecutor, although
OL,11,Fdeliberations could take months.
OL,13,FThis is something Israel's longest
OL,14,Fserving leader has been fearing for
OL,15,Fweeks. The son of a historian, Mr
OL,16,FNetanyahu is all too aware of the

OL,13,FMr Netanyahu looks most vulnerable on

OL,16,Ffact that the international community
OL,17,Fhas felt the need to conduct air drops

OL,6,FIf the arrest warrants are issued then
OL,7,Fthe Israeli PM can be mentioned in the
OL,8,Fsame breath as other defendants like
OL,9,FPutin, Gaddafi and Al-Bashir of Sudan.
OL,11,FAlmost two thirds of the world's 195
OL,12,Fcountries are party to the Rome
OL,13,FStatute and therefore members of the
OL,14,FICC.
OL,16,FAnd while Israel is not among those
OL,17,F124 nations, the alleged crimes were
OL,18,Fcommitted in what the ICC calls the
OL,19,FState of Palestine, which is a
OL,20,Fsignatory.
