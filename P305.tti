OL,4,Cfinal pitch, as Joe Biden blunders
OL,6,FVice President Kamala Harris has
OL,7,Frallied her supporters outside the
OL,8,FWhite House and promised to be a
OL,9,Fleader for all Americans, not just for
OL,10,Fher tribe.
OL,12,FThat was the explicit promise in her
OL,13,Fcampaign's closing speech which was
OL,14,Fgiven in front of 50,000 emotional
OL,15,Fsupporters and with the White House as
OL,16,Fthe backdrop.

OL,3,CUS election: Kamala Harris makes her
OL,4,Cfinal pitch, as Joe Biden blunders
OL,6,FThe location was carefully chosen. The
OL,7,Flawn adjacent to the National Mall was
OL,8,Fthe exact same spot from where Donald
OL,9,FTrump delivered his infamous speech on
OL,10,FJanuary 6 2021, when he contested the
OL,11,Felection result and ordered his
OL,12,Ffollowers to "fight like hell." They
OL,13,Fwent on to storm the Capitol.
OL,15,FSo Harris' team was using the visual
OL,16,Fstagecraft to provide the starkest of
OL,17,Fcontrasts: her message of unity
OL,18,Fpitched against the man she calls a
OL,19,F"petty dictator" and an agent of chaos.

OL,11,FUninvited to his own vice president's

OL,16,FWell, that's what his opponents are

OL,18,Fwasn't referring to all of Trump's
