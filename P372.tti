OL,6,FThis current year (2024-2025) Coventry

OL,9,Fbudget gap of #14 million by next year
OL,10,F(2025/2026).
OL,12,FThe situation improved slightly by the
OL,13,Ftime they went out to a consultation,
OL,14,Fand they found out they had #10.8
OL,15,Fmillion in savings.
OL,17,FDue to a "larger than predicted"
OL,18,Fgovernment settlement for the coming
OL,19,Fyear, they are #2.8 million better off
OL,20,Fbut there is still a budget gap of #8

OL,6,FThey are still predicting the budget

OL,10,FWhat does this mean for the public?
OL,12,FCoventry residents will still have to
OL,13,Fpay more council tax, as it increases
OL,14,Fby 4.9% to shorten the budget gap.
OL,16,FIf the budget gap increases further
