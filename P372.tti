OL,6,FThe owners, ATE Farms Ltd - who had
OL,7,Fbought the pub from Marston's just
OL,8,Fweeks before it was destroyed by a
OL,9,Ffire - were ordered by South
OL,10,FStaffordshire Council to rebuild the
OL,11,Fhistoric building in February.
OL,13,FThe enforcement notice for unlawful
OL,14,Fdemolition gave the owners three years
OL,15,Fto bring the building back to "what it
OL,16,Fwas prior to the fire", by February
OL,17,F2027.
OL,19,FBut they lodged an appeal and and the
OL,20,Fcouncil has now been notified that a
OL,21,Fplanning inspector has been appointed.
