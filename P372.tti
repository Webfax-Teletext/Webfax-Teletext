OL,7,FSo two years ago I was intrigued to
OL,8,Ffind out that villagers in northern
OL,9,FGermany had created a new memorial to
OL,10,Fhonour 14 British soldiers who'd died
OL,11,Fwhile liberating their village from
OL,12,Fthe Nazis. The men were all killed in
OL,13,Fthe last few days of the Second World
OL,14,FWar.
OL,16,FThe woman behind the project, a
OL,17,Ffarmer's wife and amateur historian
OL,18,Fcalled Debbie Bulau, was trying to
OL,19,Ftrace the families of the soldiers,
OL,20,Fbut one was eluding her.

OL,7,F19-year-old Anthony Granville Taylor-
OL,8,FHurst was part of a five-man crew

OL,10,Fthey were all killed when they hit a

OL,12,Fvillage of Kutenholz near Hamburg.
OL,14,FDebbie contacted ITV News Central for
OL,15,Fhelp in tracing Anthony's family as
OL,16,Fshe knew he was from Mansfield
