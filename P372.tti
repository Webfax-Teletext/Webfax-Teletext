OL,8,FUniversity Hospitals (NUH), as a key
OL,9,Fcontributor to the problem,
OL,10,Fresponsible for 28% of the lost hours.

OL,3,CEast Midlands Ambulance service faced
OL,4,Cdelays of 18,000 hours in February
OL,6,FThis is largely attributed to the fact
OL,7,Fthat patients who are medically fit
OL,8,Ffor discharge cannot leave the
OL,9,Fhospital due to a lack of social care
OL,10,Fplacements, exacerbating the backlog.
OL,11,FNUH say they have attempted to
OL,12,Fmitigate these challenges by allowing
OL,13,Fparamedics to 'cohort' patients, a
OL,14,Fprocess in which some ambulance staff
OL,15,Fcan depart to respond to other calls
