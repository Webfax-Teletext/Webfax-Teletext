OL,6,FIn an interview with ITV Central Mr
OL,7,FHolmes said: "About 11:00 yesterday,
OL,8,Fobviously we noticed some smoke, but

OL,11,F"No one seemed to say anything and
OL,12,Fthat was about it. Obviously, it was
OL,13,Fgetting a bit worse and blacker.
OL,15,F"We went to dinner and about 8:30 last
OL,16,Fnight, we were back into the lobby and
OL,17,Feveryone just started just walking out
OL,18,Fand then the alarms went off. I spoke
OL,19,Fto one of the guys at the bar and he
OL,20,Fbasically said, 'You've got to go and

OL,10,FMr Holmes said: "What I was concerned
OL,11,Fabout is the information I was given
OL,12,Fwas non-existent. So everyone was
OL,13,Fwhispering this and looking at Twitter
OL,14,Fand trying to find what was going on,
OL,15,Fbecause we were given no information
OL,16,Fwhatsoever.
OL,18,F"Then when we were at the stadium, the

OL,21,Fstarted getting a bit more concerned.
