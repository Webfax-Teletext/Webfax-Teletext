OL,6,FPassing sentence on Wednesday, Judge

OL,8,Foffence, involving eight blows to the
OL,9,Fhead, was aggravated by a false

OL,11,Fhis victim was alive and well when he
OL,12,Fleft the property.
OL,14,FThe judge told Norgrove, a former

OL,16,Fhammer to repeatedly strike her to the
OL,17,Fhead.
OL,19,F"You were angry because she had
