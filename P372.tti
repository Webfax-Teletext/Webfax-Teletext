OL,6,FBut it was two sisters from Derbyshire
OL,7,Fhaving a go at metal detecting who
OL,8,Fcame up with the find of the weekend.
OL,9,FBefore our very eyes, we saw Georgia
OL,10,Fand Evie Hinton make the most exciting
OL,11,Fdiscovery - a decorative brooch which
OL,12,Flooked very old. It was a very special
OL,13,Fmoment.
OL,15,FThe DSAT leaders were as thrilled as
OL,16,Fthe girls, but no-one wanted to get
OL,17,Fahead of themselves. Could it really
OL,18,Fbe Anglo-Saxon - or was this a good
OL,19,FVictorian copy?

OL,8,Fwould have broadcast our report that
