OL,6,FThe West Midlands Mayor has accused
OL,7,Fthe Environment Agency of hiding
OL,8,Fbehind "red tape and bureaucracy"
OL,9,Fwhile the region's biggest brownfield
OL,10,Fsite sits idle, six years after it was
OL,11,Fearmarked for much-needed housing.
OL,13,F630 homes were meant to be built at
OL,14,FFriar Park in Wednesbury, transforming
OL,15,Fthe former sewage works into a
OL,16,Fthriving new community.
OL,18,FHowever, progress has been at a
OL,19,Fstandstill, with the site failing to
OL,20,Fmeet the strict permit criteria
OL,21,Frequired by the Environment Agency.

OL,6,FDespite the promise of new homes, the

OL,11,FThe Environment Agency insists that a

OL,13,Fconditions are met, one of which
