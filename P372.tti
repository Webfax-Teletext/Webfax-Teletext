OL,7,FPlans to build a chicken farm near the
OL,8,FRiver Severn in Shropshire have been
OL,9,Fquashed following a High Court ruling.
OL,11,FWater campaign group River Action had
OL,12,Fclaimed the farm, housing 200,000
OL,13,Fbirds, would cause serious damage to
OL,14,Fthe river because of the amount of
OL,15,Fchicken manure produced.
OL,17,FThe sheds, housing the birds, were to
OL,18,Fbe built at North Farm in Shrewsbury -
OL,19,Fa farm run by LJ Cooke and Son.

OL,7,FShropshire Council disputed the
OL,8,Fclaims, arguing planning permission to
OL,9,Fbuild the farm was granted following
OL,10,Fdiscussion with the Environment
OL,11,FAgency, Natural England, and the
OL,12,Fcouncil's ecology and public

OL,15,FOn Tuesday (17 June), the High Court
OL,16,Fruled that the Council "failed to
