OL,8,Fchanges to the Grand National, after
OL,9,Fhis horse Hill Sixteen suffered a
OL,10,Ffatal fall at the first fence last
OL,11,Fyear.
OL,13,FNew measures have been introduced this
OL,14,Fyear to help improve safety, including
OL,15,Fmoving the first fence closer to the
OL,16,Fstart and introducing a standing start
OL,17,Fto slow horses around the first corner.
OL,19,FTrainer Sandy Thomson said: "They're
OL,20,Falways looking to make the race safer.
