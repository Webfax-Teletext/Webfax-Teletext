OL,7,FSarah Swindley from Love Windermere
OL,8,Fsaid: "One of the biggest drivers is
OL,9,Fclimate change.
OL,11,F"The lake's warming, it's warmed I
OL,12,Fthink one and a half degrees in the
OL,13,Fpast ten years, which is really
OL,14,Fsignificant.
OL,16,F"So when we see more algal blooms on
OL,17,Fthe lake, that's often the case.
