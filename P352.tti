OL,6,FWindermere's historic row boats have
OL,7,Fundergone an age-old process to
OL,8,Fprepare them for carrying passengers
OL,9,Fahead of the busy tourist season.
OL,11,FThe boats are currently submerged
OL,12,Funderwater which is part of a
OL,13,Ftraditional process called swelling.
OL,14,FThis makes the boats watertight again
OL,15,Fafter drying out in storage over the
OL,16,Fwinter months.
OL,18,FAt there are around 55 of the wooden
OL,19,Fboats with many of them dating back to
OL,20,Fthe 1930s.

OL,6,FNick Thompson, Operations Manager at
OL,7,FWindermere Lake Cruises said: "We give
OL,8,Fthem a lot of care and attention over
OL,9,Fthe winter months to make sure they
OL,10,Fare preserved for future generations
OL,11,Fto enjoy.
OL,13,F"But that conservation work means they
OL,14,Fare out of water and in our work sheds
OL,15,Fwhere they dry out, the planks shrink
OL,16,Fand they develop leaks."
OL,18,FNick explained the process the boats
OL,19,Fgo through in order to prepare them
OL,20,Ffor the busy tourist season.

OL,6,FHe said: "So, before they return to
OL,7,Fpassenger duty for the main visitor
OL,8,Fseason, we put them through this
OL,9,Ftraditional process of swelling.
OL,11,F"By submerging them in water the wood
OL,12,Fexpands and naturally closes any gaps.
OL,13,FThey will be left submerged for about
OL,14,Fa week before we pump them out and see
OL,15,Fif the swelling has been fully
OL,16,Feffective."
OL,18,FThe boats will then become watertight
OL,19,Fand will be floating before they are
OL,20,Ffitted with floorboards, footrests,
OL,21,Fand seating.

OL,14,FIn those days the boats were very
