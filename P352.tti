OL,5,GThe 50th birthday of Emmerdale this
OL,6,Gmonth also marks the golden anniversary
OL,7,Gof regular afternoon television.
OL,9,FIt seems incredible to think that the
OL,10,Fidea of afternoon entertainment was
OL,11,Fonce considered controversial.
OL,13,FUntil 1972 television broadcasting
OL,14,Fhours were limited by law.
OL,16,FThe rule was designed to protect the
OL,17,FBBC  the argument was that any
OL,18,Fextension to ITV's hours would need to
OL,19,Fbe matched by BBC One so would either
OL,20,Fmean resources being stretched or a
OL,21,Fhigher licence fee.

OL,5,FBut by 1972 the rule must have looked
OL,6,Fto some like the nanny state in action
OL,7,F protecting the public from the
OL,8,Fdangers of watching too much television
OL,9,Fand not knowing how to use the off

OL,12,FThe rule was scrapped in January 1972

OL,14,Fthe ITA and the ITV companies for the
OL,15,Fdecision not to proceed at that point

OL,5,FThe IBA (as it had just become) ensured
OL,6,Fthe extension to ITV's hours provided a

OL,12,FBut as well as soaps like Emmerdale

OL,5,FIt seems incredible it took so long.
OL,7,FThe BBC had some afternoon programmes
OL,8,Fin the 50s and early 60s, often
OL,9,Fexplicitly aimed at women. Many ITV
OL,10,Fregions had cheap but popular lunchtime
OL,11,Fvariety shows in their early days.
OL,13,FNobody could pretend a market for
OL,14,Fafternoon TV did not exist.
OL,16,FInterestingly when the restrictions
OL,17,Fwere lifted (with little meaningful
