OL,6,FFor many people, improving their home
OL,7,Fis a dream that they have. Whether
OL,8,Fit's adding an extra bedroom for the
OL,9,Fchildren or simply making their living
OL,10,Fspace more attractive - the thought of
OL,11,Fhome improvement is very attractive.
OL,13,FBut the costs are getting higher and
OL,14,Fhigher every year, especially with the
OL,15,Frise in the price of building
OL,16,Fmaterials. It can be one of the
OL,17,Fbiggest expenditures a household can
OL,18,Fmake - sometimes costing nearly as
OL,19,Fmuch as the house itself.

OL,6,FTheir main tips are to make sure you
OL,7,Flook at any qualifications your
OL,8,Fpotential builder has, check jobs they
OL,9,Fhave previously done. You could even
OL,10,Fask to speak to customers who have
OL,11,Fused their services in the past. You
OL,12,Fshould also ask to check their
