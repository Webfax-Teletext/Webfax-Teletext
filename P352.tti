OL,6,FIn a statement the Met Office said:
OL,7,F"Outbreaks of rain spreading
OL,8,Fnortheastwards later on Saturday and
OL,9,Fovernight into Sunday will likely be
OL,10,Fpreceded by a spell of snow on its

OL,13,F"Whilst there is a fair bit of
OL,14,Funcertainty as to how far north this
OL,15,Fmay spread, and how long any snow will
OL,16,Flast, significant accumulations of
OL,17,Fsnow are possible, especially (but not
OL,18,Fexclusively) on hills.
