OL,11,FWilliam 'Bill' Trotter was a

OL,14,Fdied in July last year, and nine

OL,6,FThe 73-year-old was admitted to
OL,7,FCumberland Infirmary in Carlisle in
OL,8,FMay last year, after a course of
OL,9,Fantibiotics to clear an infection in
OL,10,Fhis toes failed and he became
OL,11,Fincreasingly unwell. What followed,
OL,12,Fhis children told ITV News in an
OL,13,Fexclusive interview, was a catalogue
OL,14,Fof errors in care over the following
OL,15,Fweeks before his death.
OL,17,F"They kept saying is 'your father
OL,18,Fisn't a healthy man'," said Bill's
OL,19,Fdaughter, Kelly. He had diabetes and
OL,20,Fhad recently undertaken an operation
OL,21,Fto put stents in his heart.
