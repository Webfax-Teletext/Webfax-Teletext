OL,5,GTV schedules are now back to normal
OL,6,Gfollowing the period of mourning which
OL,7,Gfollowed the death of HM The Queen. But
OL,8,Gthere will be a legacy which is likely
OL,9,Gto be felt for several days.
OL,11,FThe main commercial channels suspended
OL,12,Fall advertising in the immediate
OL,13,Faftermath of The Queen's death.
OL,15,FThrough the period of mourning, there
OL,16,Fwas no advertising around programmes
OL,17,Fconcerning Her Majesty's death or the
OL,18,Ffuneral. Indeed advertising is
OL,19,Fspecifically forbidden during formal
OL,20,FRoyal events.

OL,5,FHowever this means that more
OL,6,Fadvertising than normal is now being
OL,7,Fshown.
OL,9,FThe Code on the Scheduling of
OL,10,FTelevision Advertisements allows for
OL,11,Fthe transfer of lost advertising time
OL,12,Fin certain circumstances. This is just
OL,13,Fsuch a situation.
OL,15,FThe broadcasters will have approached
OL,16,FOfcom with a request to do this.
OL,18,FThe temporary increase in advertising
OL,19,Fis particularly noticeable on ITV.

OL,5,FFor instance there is now a full 12
OL,6,Fminutes of advertising in the 3pm hour
OL,7,Fand an extra 4 minute break just before
OL,8,Fthe ITV Evening News at 6.30pm.
OL,10,FThe break before 9pm has also been
OL,11,Freconfigured  generally 90 seconds of
OL,12,Fadvertising Is running before 9pm and
OL,13,F90 seconds afterwards. Before, the
OL,14,Fbreak normally only lasted 90 seconds
OL,15,Fin total.
OL,17,FThis is being done, it seems, to allow
OL,18,Fan extra break of around 4 minutes

OL,5,FThe main reason for moving things round
OL,6,Fso much is to ensure that no clock hour
OL,7,Fcontains more than 12 minutes of
OL,8,Fadverts.
OL,10,FWhile this is only temporary, it comes

OL,5,FThe decision is not a given  there is
OL,6,Fa risk that an increase in advertising
OL,7,Ftime could drive down prices so be of
OL,8,Fno benefit to broadcasters or viewers.
OL,9,FThat will need proper examination.
OL,11,FIt doesn't go without saying that a
OL,12,Fpermanent increase would be handled in
OL,13,Fthe same way on air. Programme
