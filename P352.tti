OL,6,FHere's a flavour of that from Rishi
OL,7,FSunak's speech today: "It is the
OL,8,FScottish Conservatives who are
OL,9,Fopposing the SNP making Scotland the
OL,10,Fmost taxed part of the United Kingdom.
OL,11,FWhile the Conservative government is
OL,12,Fcutting tax for every worker in

OL,14,Ftax on everyone who earns more than

OL,8,Fenergy security, and the thousands of
OL,9,Fjobs here in the North East that
OL,10,Fdepend on the oil and gas sector. A
OL,11,Fvote for anyone else is a vote to shut

OL,14,FNow the SNP would argue that they have
OL,15,Fput up income tax in Scotland for the
OL,16,Fbetter off to pay for better public
OL,17,Fservices.And they would say they are
OL,18,Fthe true champions of the oil and gas
