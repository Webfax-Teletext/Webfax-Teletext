OL,6,FChristmas is over, the weather is
OL,7,Fcold, the cost of living is up and
OL,8,Fpolitical uncertainty is rife.
OL,10,FThe winter blues are not uncommon, and
OL,11,FMichael Boaden, CEO of Carlisle Eden
OL,12,FMind, says it's little wonder more
OL,13,Fpeople struggle with their mental
OL,14,Fhealth around this time of year.
OL,16,F"Sometimes January can be a very hard
OL,17,Ftime of the year for people - post-
OL,18,FChristmas blues, maybe some financial
OL,19,Fworries, sometimes relationships are
OL,20,Funder pressure over the Christmas
OL,21,Fperiod," said Michael.

OL,6,F"People come out of that very high
OL,7,Fperiod and sometimes struggle. But I
OL,8,Fthink the important thing to always
OL,9,Fbear in mind is that people's mental
OL,10,Fhealth struggles can happen at
OL,11,Fanytime, we can all go through ups and
OL,12,Fdowns, and sometimes we need help and
OL,13,Fsupport in dealing with that," he

OL,14,F"We run a helpline, and we run

OL,6,F"Checking in with friends is very
OL,7,Fimportant, checking in with family
OL,8,Fmembers this time of year is also very
OL,9,Fimportant, but sometimes it might be
OL,10,Fuseful to get some advice and support
OL,11,Ffrom organisations that walk this
OL,12,Fterritory all the time - and I would
OL,13,Furge people to do that.
OL,15,F"There is help available out there and
OL,16,Fdon't suffer on your own with issues,
OL,17,Fand certainly don't let family members
OL,18,Fand friends suffer if you can find a
