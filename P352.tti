OL,6,FExplaining why pilgrims would make
OL,7,Fsuch a long journey, Glen Collie - the
OL,8,Fsession clerk at the cathedral - said:
OL,9,F"If you consider coming from the
OL,10,Fbrilliance of the light outside into
OL,11,Fthe building which itself is fairly
OL,12,Fdark, you start experiencing the drama.
OL,14,F"There will be chanting and song sung
OL,15,Fand little services going on in the
OL,16,Fchapel all over the building.
OL,18,F"There would be reputedly a piece of
OL,19,Fthe holy cross that would be displayed
OL,20,Fin a small casket.
