OL,6,FThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) has
OL,7,Fraised objections to a proposed Hawick
OL,8,Fwind farm citing national security
OL,9,Fconcerns.
OL,11,FInvenergy UK has submitted a planning
OL,12,Fapplication for Mid Hill Wind Farm to
OL,13,Fbe located north of Harwood Farmhouse,
OL,14,Fcomprising of 13 turbines with blade
OL,15,Ftip heights of up to 200 metres and a
OL,16,Fcapacity of around 7.2 MW each.
OL,18,FThe energy company say the plant would
OL,19,Fgenerate enough electricity to supply
OL,20,Fabout 78,018 local households annually.
