OL,6,Fpeople in our region will be planning
OL,7,Fto take part in cold water dips as
OL,8,Fpart of New Year's celebrations and
OL,9,Fchallenges.
OL,11,FWild swimming and cold water plunging
OL,12,Fhave grown in popularity over the
OL,13,Fyears, with participants saying it can
OL,14,Fimprove fitness, mental wellbeing and
OL,15,Fsense of community.
OL,17,FThere is some evidence to suggest that
OL,18,Fcold water can help boost metabolism,
OL,19,Fsoothe aches and pains, improve
OL,20,Fcirculation and reduce stress levels.
