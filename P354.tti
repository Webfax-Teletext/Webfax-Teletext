OL,7,FSpeaking to ITV, Keith said: "I was
OL,8,Fnearly finished. I was about two moves
OL,9,Faway from safety on to easy ground at
OL,10,Fthe top and both footholds just
OL,11,Fdisappeared and my ice axe yanked out.
OL,13,F"I catapulted downwards, backwards off
OL,14,Fdown the shoot, down sort of a snowy
OL,15,Fgroove and over a ledge. And the
OL,16,Frucksack acted like a toboggan I was
OL,17,Fgoing backwards down this slope.
OL,19,F"When I knew I was going to go over
OL,20,Fthe drop, I thought this could kill
OL,21,Fme."

OL,7,FKeith was diagnosed with parkinson's
OL,8,Fdisease six years ago and finds that
OL,9,Fadrenaline relieves his symptoms.
OL,11,FHe said: "When I was first diagnosed,
OL,12,FI thought I was going to turn into a
OL,13,Fcouch potato. When I discovered that
OL,14,Fclimbing made me feel young again.
OL,16,F"The adrenaline rush I get from
OL,17,Fclimbing or from other sports as well
OL,18,Factually means I don't have to take

OL,8,F"miraculous" that he was still alive.
OL,10,FShe said: "When you look at the whole

OL,12,FBecause he flipped and his rucksack
OL,13,Facted as a sort of sled, that's
OL,14,Fprotected his body a great deal on the
OL,15,Fway down.
OL,17,F"And then landing in deep snow, when
