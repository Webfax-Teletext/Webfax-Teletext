OL,10,FNot only are they in people's homes,

OL,15,FThis flies in the face - if you pardon

OL,8,Fclearly shows that unauthorised flags

OL,11,FThe laws are designed to stop people
OL,12,Fcausing a danger to pedestrians and

OL,18,Flikely to see red, white and blue.

OL,6,FIt's been well over a month since they
OL,7,Ffirst appeared and yet it seems there
OL,8,Fis a reluctance to take them down.
OL,9,FIt's clearly a sensitive issue with

OL,13,FBut it won't have escaped the notice

OL,15,Fover the summer that the issue of

OL,9,Fclear that it was not the flags of

OL,11,Fbut he felt the motives behind putting

OL,8,Fhaving come from Kenya seeking asylum
OL,9,Fand is now the chairperson of Cumbria

OL,6,FThis is very much an issue that stirs
OL,7,Fa lot of emotion - for some seeing
OL,8,Fflags on lampposts are inspiring and
OL,9,Frepresent an expression of their
OL,10,Fbeliefs. But there are those who now
OL,11,Fsee it as a worry for their safety.
OL,13,FWhat seems clear is that there is no
OL,14,Fappetite to take the flags down from
OL,15,Flampposts right now - even though the
OL,16,Flaw is quite clear. Perhaps it's a
