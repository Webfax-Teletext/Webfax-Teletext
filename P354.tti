OL,6,FIf you speak to a local in West
OL,7,FCumbria, they'll likely tell you
OL,8,Fthere's an issue with antisocial
OL,9,Fbehaviour (ASB) in the area.
OL,11,FMany of the perpetrators are children
OL,12,F- sometimes as young as 11. After
OL,13,Fschool, they're often seen hanging
OL,14,Faround high streets.
OL,16,FCumbria Police is no stranger to this
OL,17,Ffact. Through Operation Enhance, the
OL,18,Fforce aims to tackle ASB in hotspot
OL,19,Fareas across the county by deploying
OL,20,Fextra patrols in 15 locations.
