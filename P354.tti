OL,6,FCouncillor Robin Tatler, SBC's
OL,7,FExecutive Member for Public Safety and
OL,8,FResilience, said: "The sale of illicit
OL,9,Ftobacco undermines public health and
OL,10,Fsafety, as these products often fail
OL,11,Fto meet legal standards. This type of
OL,12,Ftargeted operation also helps protect
OL,13,Freputable local businesses who are
OL,14,Faffected by the unfair competition
OL,15,Ffrom those operating illegally.
OL,17,F"One of the premises had an elaborate
OL,18,Fapproach to hiding their illegal
OL,19,Ftobacco but this was no match for
OL,20,FRosie and Boo, who made short work of
OL,21,Ffinding the goods."
