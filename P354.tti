OL,6,FThe UK's once thriving wool industry
OL,7,Fwent into decline during the 1970s and

OL,12,FMany sheep farmers kept their fleece
OL,13,For even burned it rather than
OL,14,Fcollecting the small sum they could
OL,15,Fsell them for.
OL,17,FBut, this month the wool industry has
OL,18,Freported the sharpest increase in
