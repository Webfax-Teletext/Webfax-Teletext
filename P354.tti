OL,7,FAn MSP in Galloway has suggested a
OL,8,Fconsultation paper sent to Government
OL,9,FMinisters on a proposed national park
OL,10,Fin the area shows a majority of locals
OL,11,Fdo not support the plans.
OL,13,FFinlay Carson, Conservative MSP for
OL,14,FGalloway and West Dumfries, said in
OL,15,FHolyrood today: "It is my
OL,16,Funderstanding that there is not a

OL,18,Fpark proposal and that a full
OL,19,Fdesignation order is unlikely to be
