OL,7,G"The BBC plans to stop terrestrial TV
OL,8,Gin 2030" screamed the clickbait
OL,9,Gheadlines of the week. Yet it's
OL,10,Gcompletely false.
OL,12,FAs reported earlier in the week, the
OL,13,FBBC Director-General Tim Davie used his
OL,14,FRoyal Television Society speech to
OL,15,Fconfirm the BBC wanted to ditch
OL,16,Ftraditional broadcast platforms in
OL,17,Ffavour of going internet only.

OL,7,FBut the BBC has just told Ofcom it
OL,8,Fsupports ongoing use of terrestrial TV
OL,9,Ffrequencies. Where did the notion that
OL,10,Fthe BBC wanted to do this in 2030 come
OL,11,Ffrom?
OL,13,FThere's a valid threat that terrestrial
OL,14,FTV could be forced off the airwaves
OL,15,Ffrom 2030 ` not because the BBC plans
OL,16,Fto do so ` but because of an

OL,11,FThe current Freeview frequencies are
OL,12,Fonly secure until 2030, but the BBC has
OL,13,Fjoined others in campaigning for a 'no

OL,7,FThe BBC's motive is to ensure
OL,8,Fterrestrial TV can continue to remain
OL,9,Fon air until at least 2034, when
OL,10,FFreeview multiplex licences are due to
OL,11,Fexpire. As Tim Davie highlighted, UK
OL,12,Fbroadband infrastructure is not up for
OL,13,Fsuch a move...yet.
OL,15,FThe BBC thinks the UK needs some extra

OL,8,Fto specialist equipment (PMSE) that is
OL,9,Fused to make live programmes and cover
OL,10,Fspecial events, like Glastonbury or the

OL,14,FThe decision to make no change could
OL,15,Fthen be revisited at the next WRC in

OL,7,FThere is recognition that switching to
OL,8,Fonline is not the end of linear
OL,9,Fbroadcasting ` in fact services like
OL,10,FPluto TV, Samsung TV Plus and ITVX FAST
OL,11,Fchannels confirm linear will continue,
OL,12,Fbut in a different way to before.
OL,14,FAny future TV service will need to

OL,17,Fwithout having to go in and out of lots
