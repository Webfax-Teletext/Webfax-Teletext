OL,6,GIt's been one of the biggest weeks in
OL,7,GLiverpool for years.  The Eurovision
OL,8,GSong Contest has generated heaps of
OL,9,Gpositive publicity for the city.
OL,11,FThe boost to the local economy this
OL,12,Fweek ` hotels, bars, restaurants `
OL,13,Fwill have been significant.  The
OL,14,Fshowcasing of Merseyside to the rest
OL,15,Fof Europe provides a great
