OL,6,FParents in a village are fighting to
OL,7,Fkeep a local school open, which they
OL,8,Fsay is a hub for the local community.
OL,10,FDalry Primary and Secondary School has
OL,11,Fseen pupil numbers decline over the
OL,12,Fyears, corresponding with a fall in
OL,13,Fstaff numbers and subject choices.
OL,15,FNext month, councillors will consider
OL,16,Fwhether to mothball the school - a
OL,17,Fstep parents say is tantamount to
OL,18,Fclosing it all together.

OL,6,FFor parents like Sharon Currie, the
OL,7,Fschool has been a part of her life
OL,8,Fsince she herself was a child.
OL,10,FShe attended it for her primary and
OL,11,Fsecondary education, and now her
OL,12,Fchildren do too. "It's a big part of
OL,13,Fthe community," she explained.
OL,15,F"The well-being of my children is the
OL,16,Fmost important thing here, so I
OL,17,Fwouldn't be able to send them to
OL,18,Fanother school because they would not
OL,19,Fwant to leave Dalry school. They want
OL,20,Fto continue there education here."

OL,6,FCurrent pupil Rosa agreed with her

OL,9,Fthan a barrier, to her education.
OL,11,F"I love this school. It's amazing and
OL,12,Fit's so nice that we can be friends
OL,13,Fwith each other and know each other,"

OL,6,FA meeting was held last month to
OL,7,Fdiscuss the school's future. To some,
OL,8,Fkeeping a school with just sixteen
OL,9,Fpupils open doesn't make economic
OL,10,Fsense. But parents who spoke to ITV
OL,11,FNews stressed that local amenities
OL,12,Fkeep a small village like alive.
OL,14,F"I think it would have an enormous
OL,15,Fimpact both on the community here,
OL,16,Fbecause families wouldn't come, they
OL,17,Fwouldn't be attracted to either
OL,18,Fstaying here or living here," said one.

OL,6,FIf the school is mothballed its pupils
OL,7,Fwill likely attend alternatives in the

OL,9,Fchair Stewart Gibson said that would
OL,10,Fmean daily travel time of around
OL,11,Feighty minutes, using transport which,
OL,12,Fhe claimed, can often be unreliable.
OL,14,F"It's going to be up earlier, home

OL,17,F"We've already been told that any
OL,18,Fchildren traveling to Castle Douglas
OL,19,Fwon't be able to take part in out of
