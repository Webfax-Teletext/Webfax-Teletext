OL,6,FMore than six thousand people have
OL,7,Fsigned a petition against plans to
OL,8,Fremove a 120-year old weir from a
OL,9,FCumbrian lake.
OL,11,FCampaigners insist the removal of the
OL,12,Fweir would be "environmental
OL,13,Fvandalism" and argue it will lower
OL,14,Fwater levels and threaten wildlife.
OL,16,FUnited Utilities says it wants to re-
OL,17,Fnaturalise Crummock Water now it's no
OL,18,Flonger used as a reservoir - something
OL,19,Fthe company says will help reduce
OL,20,Fflood risk and boost biodiversity.

OL,10,Fwill also be higher at some points as

OL,17,Fwe return it to its more natural
