OL,7,Fwas when he secured victory for the
OL,8,FBlues in the third round of the 1968

OL,10,FJanuary, Murray scored the only goal
OL,11,Fof the match with a header.

OL,14,FMurray later reflected on this

OL,16,Fwas so busy watching the big fellows
OL,17,Fthat they forgot about the smallest
OL,18,Fman on the park."
