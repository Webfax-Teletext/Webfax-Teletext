OL,5,FThe back panels of the set previously 
OL,6,Fincluded one large TV screen and two  
OL,7,Ffixed images at either side. The panels
OL,8,Fhave now been entirely replaced  but 
OL,9,Flook very similar to what went before.
OL,11,FA key difference is that we now have  
OL,12,Fthree large TV screens within the     
OL,13,Fpanels, with the ability to display   
OL,14,Fimages sent through from the gallery. 
OL,16,FThe oval/rectangle desk has been

OL,19,FThe programme's theme tune has also   
OL,20,Fundergone a minor update.

OL,5,FThe BBC's Northern Irish radio stations

OL,10,FBBC Radio Ulster moved first. BBC Radio
OL,11,FFoyle followed later, after 9pm.      
OL,13,FFoyle's large profile images seem to be
OL,14,Fout-of-step with the Chameleon branding
