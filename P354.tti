OL,6,FThe chair of an NHS Board has
OL,7,Freflected on her six years in the
OL,8,Frole, ahead of her retirement at the
OL,9,Fend of the month.
OL,11,FKaren Hamilton, Chair of NHS Borders,
OL,12,Fwas appointed in 2019, before which
OL,13,Fshe was a Non-Executive Director. Her
OL,14,Ftime in the lead role was dominated by
OL,15,Fthe Covid-19 pandemic.
OL,17,FMs Hamilton told ITV Border: "To
OL,18,Fdescribe it as a rollercoaster is
OL,19,Fprobably an underestimation.

OL,9,Fwhich really just put everything that

OL,6,FThe latest NHS Borders financial

OL,8,Fof #30million, but Ms Hamilton
OL,9,Fsuggests she has left the health board

OL,12,FShe said: "The work we are doing and
OL,13,Fthe advances that we're making in
OL,14,Fterms of trying to get ourselves back
OL,15,Fto financial balance, we're on the way.
OL,17,F"It's a long process. I'm talking
OL,18,Fyears, five years, probably... it's
OL,19,Fnot going to be an easy solution. And
OL,20,Fit's the same for pretty much all
