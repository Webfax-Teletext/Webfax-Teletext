OL,6,FA campaigner says the reopening of the

OL,8,F"transformational for people" in the
OL,9,Farea.
OL,11,FThe #300 million track - stretching up

OL,13,Fpassengers last year.
OL,15,FThe Railway was officially opened by
OL,16,FQueen Elizabeth on 9th September 2025.
OL,18,FAfter more than 40 years, its
OL,19,Freopening put the Scottish Borders
OL,20,Fback on the rail map in the eyes of
OL,21,Fresidents.

OL,13,FHe said: "Having the railway for the
