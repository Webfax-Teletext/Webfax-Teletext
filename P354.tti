OL,6,FIn 1995, Mr Hall was informed that one
OL,7,Fof the samples he had received had
OL,8,Fbeen contaminated with hepatitis C, a
OL,9,Fvirus that can seriously damage the
OL,10,Fliver.
OL,12,FIt led to diagnoses of diabetes and,
OL,13,Feventually, liver cancer.
OL,15,FMr Hall told ITV Border he was still

OL,17,Fand said he wants government
