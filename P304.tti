OL,7,FIf this were a joke inside a Christmas
OL,8,Fcracker, rather than an article on a
OL,9,Fwebsite, you might start it with the
OL,10,Fphrase "pull yourself together".
OL,12,FBut as it is the latter, rather than
OL,13,Fthe former, we won't!
OL,15,FNevertheless, it is remarkable what
OL,16,Fcan be made from an old pair of
OL,17,Fcurtains, even more so if the unwanted
OL,18,Fdrapes came from King Charles' house
OL,19,Fin Sandringham.
