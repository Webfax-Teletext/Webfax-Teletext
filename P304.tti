OL,8,Ffor nine months have spoken for the
OL,9,Ffirst time since their return, with
OL,10,Fthe spacecraft's commander saying that

OL,15,Fwere expected to be gone just a week
OL,16,Fwhen they launched on Boeing's
OL,17,FStarliner's first astronaut flight,
OL,18,Fhowever due to technical issues, their
OL,19,Fstay on the International Space
OL,20,FStation was extended to nine months.
