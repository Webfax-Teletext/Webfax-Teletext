OL,6,FOne of the leading Post Office Horizon
OL,7,Fscandal campaigners has said he will
OL,8,Freject an offer of compensation from
OL,9,Fthe government, which he says is
OL,10,F"around a sixth" of what he asked for.
OL,12,FAlan Bates, whose two-decade fight
OL,13,Finspired the ITV series Mr Bates vs
OL,14,FThe Post Office, told ITV News the
OL,15,Foffer was "paltry".
OL,17,FSpeaking to ITV News, Mr Bates said:
OL,18,F"It's a paltry offer. I'm frustrated
OL,19,Fby the insincerity of the Post Office
OL,20,Fand how long it's taking to go through
OL,21,Fthe compensation process.
