OL,6,FCancer is one of the top four diseases

OL,8,Fof tiredness, a study has found.
OL,10,FExperts said that while many people go
OL,11,Fto their GP with new symptoms of
OL,12,Ffatigue, working out what is causing
OL,13,Fit can be tricky.
OL,15,FThe study examined 237 diseases and
OL,16,Ffound that conditions such as
OL,17,Fdepression, respiratory tract
OL,18,Finfection, insomnia and thyroid
OL,19,Fproblems (in women) were commonly
OL,20,Flinked to fatigue, but varied by
OL,21,Fpatient age and sex.
