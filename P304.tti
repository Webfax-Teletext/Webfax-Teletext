OL,6,FScientists have discovered a new
OL,7,Fmethod of squeezing apple juice which
OL,8,Fmay help to boost its health benefits.
OL,10,FThe study found that this new method
OL,11,Fboosted polyphenol content by four
OL,12,Ftimes as much as regular apple juice.
OL,14,FPolyphenols are natural plant
OL,15,Fcompounds found in fruit, red wine,
OL,16,Fand cocoa which are antioxidants, and
OL,17,Fare thought to have a range of health
OL,18,Fbenefits for the heart and brain, and
OL,19,Fmay protect against disease.

OL,6,FResearchers say they can maximise
OL,7,Fthese compounds in the juice by using
OL,8,Fa new method called a spiral filter
OL,9,Fpress, which actively takes out oxygen
OL,10,Fby vacuum-driven pressing.
OL,12,FOxygen is excluded from all other
OL,13,Fprocessing steps, therefore reducing
OL,14,Fnutrient deterioration, according to
OL,15,Fthe experts.
OL,17,FPast research has suggested that one
OL,18,Fgroup of polyphenols, called flavan-3-
OL,19,Fols, may help improve blood pressure,
OL,20,Fcholesterol concentrations, and blood
OL,21,Fsugar.

OL,6,FCo-researcher on the study, Stefan
OL,7,FDussling, said: "Nutrient losses are
OL,8,Fcommonly due to the presence of oxygen
OL,9,Fwhich quickly degrades some of the
OL,10,Fnutrients in apple juice like flavan-3-
OL,11,Fols or vitamin C.
OL,13,F"This would happen when we juice
OL,14,Fapples at home or buy a ready-made
OL,15,Fproduct.
OL,17,F"We hope that the new juicing method
OL,18,Fwill be used more widely in the future
OL,19,Fto help people get more of these
OL,20,Fbeneficial natural compounds simply by
OL,21,Fdrinking one glass of juice."
