OL,3,CWhat are ultra-processed-foods?
OL,5,FThousands of deaths in the UK could be
OL,6,Flinked to ultra-processed-foods (UPFs)
OL,7,Faccording to a new study published in
OL,8,Fthe American Journal of Preventive
OL,9,FMedicine.
OL,11,FExperts studied data from eight
OL,12,Fcountries around the world and found
OL,13,FUPFs account for around 53% of the
OL,14,Faverage person's energy intake in the
OL,15,FUK - second only to the US at 55%.
OL,17,FDr Nilson said the study found "each
OL,18,F10% increase in the participation of
OL,19,FUPFs in the diet increases the risk of
OL,20,Fdeath from all causes by 3%".
