OL,6,FNew York City Mayor Eric Adams is

OL,8,Fbeing indicted by a grand jury.
OL,10,FIn a speech recorded at his official

OL,12,Fin office, describing any charges he
OL,13,Fmay face as "entirely false, based on
OL,14,Flies."
OL,16,F"I always knew that if I stood my
OL,17,Fground for all of you, that I would be
OL,18,Fa target - and a target I became,"
OL,19,FAdams said. "I will fight these
