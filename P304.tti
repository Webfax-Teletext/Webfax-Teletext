OL,3,CWhy Washington could reject Mandelson

OL,6,FThere is a theoretical possibility
OL,7,Fthat Washington could reject
OL,8,FMandelson's appointment as ambassador.
OL,10,FThat is because the process known in
OL,11,Fdiplomatic lingo as agrement - or
OL,12,Fvetting and approval of a new ambo by
OL,13,Fthe host country - won't complete for
OL,14,Fat least two weeks, and possibly
OL,15,Flonger.
OL,17,FThat is why Mandelson's disclosure and
OL,18,Fconfirmation as ambassador was so
OL,19,Fsurprising. Such senior announcements
OL,20,Falmost never happen till after
OL,21,Fagrement.

OL,6,FSo will the US reject Mandelson?
OL,7,FNormally there would be zero chance of
OL,8,Fthat.
OL,10,FFor one thing Trump and his team were
OL,11,Fgiven almost no warning of Starmer's
OL,12,Fchoice of Mandelson - and I am told he
OL,13,Fis not fond of surprises.
OL,15,FAnd for another, there are some around
OL,16,FTrump who are making it clear they are
OL,17,Fhostile to Mandelson.
OL,19,FAlso - and to state the obvious -
OL,20,FTrump does not govern or act in
OL,21,Faccordance with normal traditions.

OL,6,FSo the premature leak of Mandelson's
OL,7,Fappointment, before the ground was
OL,8,Fproperly smoothed with the in-coming
OL,9,Fpresident, carries a marginally
OL,10,Fgreater than theoretical risk that
OL,11,FMandelson will never actually take up
OL,12,Fthe post.
OL,14,FFor Starmer this hugely important
OL,15,Fappointment is all a bit more
OL,16,Funpredictable and chaotic than he
OL,17,Fwould think ideal.
