OL,6,FITV News has heard multiple accounts
OL,7,Fthat give a different version of this,
OL,8,Fwith Palestinians saying the IDF has
OL,9,Fforced them out, and that it is
OL,10,Fseparating men from their families at

OL,13,FIsrael's stated aim is to find Hamas.
OL,15,FThe fear of facing this has convinced

OL,17,Fdespite the risk of being killed under
OL,18,Fthe daily bombardment.
