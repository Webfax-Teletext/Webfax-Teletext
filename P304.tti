OL,3,CWhy are we seeing more starling
OL,4,Cmurmurations?
OL,6,FStarlings are thought to gather in
OL,7,Fmurmurations primarily to deter
OL,8,Fpredators, using the swirling flock as
OL,9,Fa form of protection.
OL,11,FThe larger the flock, the lower the
OL,12,Frisk for each individual bird, as
OL,13,Fpredators are more likely to be
OL,14,Fconfused by the shifting mass.
OL,16,FWith extremely fast reaction times,
OL,17,Fstarlings can change direction in an
OL,18,Finstant, allowing the entire group to
OL,19,Frespond to movements seamlessly.
