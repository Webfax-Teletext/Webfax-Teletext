OL,6,FThe US state of Alabama is preparing
OL,7,Fto put a man to death with a new
OL,8,Fmethod of execution - nitrogen gas.
OL,10,FPrison officials will put a mask on

OL,12,Fto breathe pure nitrogen and depriving
OL,13,Fhim of oxygen.
OL,15,FSmith is due to be executed on
OL,16,FThursday evening Alabama time, which
OL,17,Fwill be the early hours of Friday
