OL,7,FSpeaking from the Commonwealth Heads
OL,8,Fof Government Meeting (CHOGM) in
OL,9,FSamoa, Sir Keir Starmer insisted that
OL,10,Fcommonwealth countries' priorities
OL,11,Fwere resilience in the face of climate
OL,12,Fchange and trade, rather than slavery.
OL,14,F"Of course, there's discussion about
OL,15,Fwhat we do in recognition of the slave
OL,16,Ftrade... That is history. We can't
OL,17,Fchange our history.
OL,19,F"The question for me, as we head into
OL,20,Fthe days of this conference is what do
OL,21,Fwe most want to focus on," he said.
