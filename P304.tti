OL,6,FITV News reporter Sam Holder joined
OL,7,Ffamilies across the UK as they
OL,8,Fcelebrated Passover
OL,10,FThere is an old Jewish saying: "For
OL,11,Fevery two Jews, there are three
OL,12,Fopinions."
OL,14,FSo, it is no surprise that almost
OL,15,Fevery Jewish family in the UK has
OL,16,Ftheir own traditions when it comes to
OL,17,Fcelebrating the ancient festival of
OL,18,FPassover.

OL,6,FThe very abridged story goes that in
OL,7,Froughly 1400 B.C., the Israelites were
OL,8,Fheld in captivity by the Pharaoh.
OL,10,FAfter God sends 10 plagues to the
OL,11,FEgyptians, the Israelites escape when
OL,12,Fthe Red Sea splits, offering them a

OL,15,FThose Israelites became the Jewish
OL,16,Fpeople.
OL,18,FPassover is so old that even Jesus
OL,19,Fobserved it - the 'Last Supper' is
OL,20,Ftraditionally believed to have been a
OL,21,FPassover 'Seder' meal.
