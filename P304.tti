OL,6,FOn June 14, 2017 the Grenfell Tower
OL,7,Fdisaster claimed 72 lives.
OL,9,FSeven years later, the final report
OL,10,Finto the decades leading up to the
OL,11,Fblaze at the high-rise is due to be
OL,12,Fpublished.
OL,14,FThe report into phase one, published
OL,15,Fin October 2019, concluded the tower's
OL,16,Fcladding did not comply with building
OL,17,Fregulations and was the "principal"
OL,18,Freason for the rapid and "profoundly
OL,19,Fshocking" spread of the blaze.
