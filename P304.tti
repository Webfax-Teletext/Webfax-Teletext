OL,6,FPresident Donald Trump says he is
OL,7,Fdropping his threat of tariffs over
OL,8,FGreenland as he and Nato's Mark Rutte
OL,9,Fhave agreed "the framework of a future
OL,10,Fdeal" on the Arctic.
OL,12,FThe president had threatened to add a
OL,13,F10% tariff to goods from eight
OL,14,FEuropean countries, including the UK,
OL,15,Fover their opposition to his push to
OL,16,Facquire Greenland. They were scheduled
OL,17,Fto go into effect on February 1.
