OL,7,FJudge Gregory Carro said that although
OL,8,Fthe killing was not an ordinary crime,
OL,9,FNew York law does not consider
OL,10,Fsomething terrorism simply because it
OL,11,Fwas motivated by ideology.
OL,13,FIn a written decision, he said that
OL,14,Fwhile Mangione had shown an anger
OL,15,Ftowards UnitedHealthcare and the
OL,16,Fhealth care industry, "it does not
