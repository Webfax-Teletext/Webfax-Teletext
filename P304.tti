OL,8,Fthe decision to sack Peter Mandelson
OL,9,Fas US ambassador at a meeting in
OL,10,FDowning Street this morning.
OL,12,FBut it was last night that the PM
OL,13,Freviewed the emails showing how
OL,14,FMandelson had urged Epstein to
OL,15,Fchallenge his initial prosecution and
OL,16,Fconviction for procuring a minor for
OL,17,Fsex.

OL,12,FThey also say the devastating emails

OL,6,FBut as David Davis pointed out in

OL,8,Fincriminating emails available in
OL,9,Fpublic documents from the US Virgin
OL,10,FIslands case against JP Morgan - which

OL,14,FMandelson as business secretary was
