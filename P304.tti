OL,6,FWith the General Election taking place

OL,8,Fgovernment should accelerate
OL,9,Fhousebuilding and incentivise
OL,10,Flandlords to invest in more homes for
OL,11,Ftenants, "to improve the supply and

OL,15,FRightmove said the pace of growth in

OL,17,Fof 12% two years ago but it remains
OL,18,Fsignificantly higher than the "more
OL,19,Fnormal" level of around 2% per year
