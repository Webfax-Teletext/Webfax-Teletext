OL,6,FThe animal tried to pull itself out of
OL,7,Fthe lake, but couldn't get its footing
OL,8,Fon the dock with its hooves.
OL,10,FMr Warren said: "It's like an ice rink
OL,11,Ffor the moose and its hooves, so he
OL,12,Fjust kept slipping and slipping and
OL,13,Fcould not get up."
OL,15,FHe soon spotted the moose's mother
OL,16,Fstanding a few metres away with
OL,17,Fanother calf. Mr Warren couldn't get
OL,18,Ftoo close to help, as parents can be
OL,19,Fdangerously protective of their young.
