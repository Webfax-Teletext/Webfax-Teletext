OL,6,FMany of us would love to wake up to a
OL,7,Fwinter wonderland - a little like
OL,8,FCameron Diaz in The Holiday - but
OL,9,Funless you live in the Highlands of
OL,10,FScotland, there's a very slim chance
OL,11,Fof a snowy Christmas.
OL,13,FSince 1960, we have only had four
OL,14,Fyears with lying snow across large
OL,15,Fswathes of the UK on Christmas Day:
OL,16,F1981, 1995, 2009 and 2010.

OL,3,CWill there be a white Christmas in the

OL,6,FPartly, our perception of a white
OL,7,FChristmas differs from the Met Office
OL,8,Fdefinition.
OL,10,FThe Met Office defines a white
OL,11,FChristmas as a flake of snow falling
OL,12,Fat a particular weather station at a
OL,13,Fmonitored site within the 24 hours of
OL,14,FChristmas.
OL,16,FThere are numerous sites across the
OL,17,FUK, and so it's possible to have a
OL,18,Fwhite Christmas at one site and not
OL,19,Fanother.

OL,6,FThe term white Christmas in this sense
OL,7,Fcan therefore be used with one flake
OL,8,Fof snow falling in Aberdeen, for
OL,9,Fexample.
OL,11,FThe rest of us expect a white

OL,13,Fmight have fallen previous to
OL,14,FChristmas Day.
