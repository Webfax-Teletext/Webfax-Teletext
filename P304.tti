OL,7,FA NASA spacecraft has set off on a
OL,8,Fquest to explore Jupiter's icy moon
OL,9,FEuropa in a bid to see whether it
OL,10,Fcould support life.
OL,12,FOn Monday, the rocket - named the
OL,13,FEuropa Clipper - launched from
OL,14,FFlorida's Kennedy Space Center, where
OL,15,Fit will make a five and a half year
OL,16,Fjourney to reach Jupiter.
OL,18,FThe aim for the mission is to
OL,19,Festablish if a deep ocean exists
OL,20,Fbeneath Europa's icy crust, which
OL,21,Fcould be a sign of life.
