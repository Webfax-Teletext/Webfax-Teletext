OL,8,Fthe stars and planets around the

OL,10,Fthought, a group of scientists have
OL,11,Ffound.
OL,13,FThe international group of astronomers
OL,14,Fand astrochemists reviewed years' of
OL,15,Fresearch to try and resolve a simple
OL,16,Fquestion ` is cosmic dust porous?
OL,18,FThese tiny dust grains are fundamental
OL,19,Fto astronomy and are found in the star-

OL,21,FPillars of Creation.
