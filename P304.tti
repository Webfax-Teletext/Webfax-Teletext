OL,12,FWhat will the political impact be on

OL,15,FThis is the most fascinating question.
OL,16,FThis significance of the case is not

OL,7,Fhim. Polling shows the vast majority
OL,8,Fof Americans won't change their minds,
OL,9,Feven with a conviction or an acquittal.

OL,3,CThe Trump verdict: Five key questions
OL,5,FYes, if Trump is convicted, we can be
OL,6,Fcertain there will be an appeal. His
OL,7,Flegal team can appeal to both the New
OL,8,FYork Supreme Court's Appellate
OL,9,FDivision and then to the New York
OL,10,FState Court of Appeals (the latter is
OL,11,Fwhere Harvey Weinstein's scored his ).
OL,13,FSo this legal drama is not over. And
OL,14,Fif there is a split jury and a
OL,15,Fmistrial is declared by the judge, the
OL,16,FNew York District Attorney can re-file
OL,17,Fthe charges and start again with a
OL,18,Fdifferent jury. Only a full acquittal
OL,19,Fwill ensure this case is over.

OL,5,FYes, it's easy to forget the New York
OL,6,Ftrial is widely seen as the weakest of
OL,7,Fthe four cases. Trump also faces the
OL,8,Fprospect of another state trial, in
OL,9,FAtlanta, Georgia, where he is charged
OL,10,Fwith election interference.
OL,12,FAnd then there are two federal trials
OL,13,Fthat are likely to happen at some

OL,12,FIf he is convicted and goes to jail,

OL,15,FYes, absolutely. There is nothing in

OL,7,Fcould face a fine or be made to do

OL,10,Flike falsifying business records, it's
