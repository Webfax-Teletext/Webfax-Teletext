OL,6,FClapping for the NHS during the
OL,7,Fpandemic may have been "dangerous"
OL,8,Fbecause "no organisation can be a
OL,9,Fnational religion", the health service
OL,10,Fombudsman has said.
OL,12,FRebecca Hilsenrath, the Parliamentary
OL,13,Fand Health Service Ombudsman, told The
OL,14,FTelegraph that "no organisation should
OL,15,Fbe beyond constructive criticism".
OL,17,FMs Hilsenrath has submitted evidence
