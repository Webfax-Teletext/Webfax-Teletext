OL,7,FReform UK leader Nigel Farage has said
OL,8,Fthe UK government should consider
OL,9,Fallowing Shamima Begum, who left the
OL,10,Fcountry to join the Islamic State
OL,11,Fgroup in 2015, to return to the UK.
OL,13,F"I've never wanted to. I've

OL,15,Fnow thoughtful, I'm thoughtful. I
OL,16,Fdon't classify her as an ISIS, an all
OL,17,Fout ISIS killer," Farage told ITV News
OL,18,FPolitical Correspondent Harry Horton.
OL,20,F"So she's sort of less... She is a
OL,21,Flesser part of the equation," he added.
