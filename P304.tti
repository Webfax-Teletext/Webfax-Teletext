OL,7,FIn a new post on the website for the
OL,8,Finquests, it states: "Preliminary
OL,9,Finvestigations under s 1(7) Coroners &
OL,10,FJustice Act 2009 have been carried out
OL,11,Fto identify whether there is reason to
OL,12,Fsuspect that any former patients of Mr
OL,13,FPaterson died an unnatural death as a
OL,14,Fresult of his care and treatment.
OL,16,F"Following preliminary investigations,
OL,17,FHH Richard Foster believes there is
OL,18,Fevidence to have reason to suspect
OL,19,Fthat some of those deaths may be
OL,20,Funnatural. Once opened, the inquests
OL,21,Fwill be adjourned until a later date."
