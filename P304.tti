OL,6,FTrump seems overnight to have
OL,7,Fcapitulated both in his trade wars -
OL,8,Fwith China, the conflict that matters
OL,9,F- and in his attempt to force the
OL,10,FFederal Reserve to cut interest rates.
OL,12,FTariffs on China will be negotiated
OL,13,Fmuch lower, he says. And he won't try
OL,14,Fto fire Fed chair Jerome Powell, who
OL,15,Fthinks it too early to cut the cost of
OL,16,Fmoney.
