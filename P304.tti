OL,9,FCharged particles from the sun,
OL,10,Fprimarily electrons and protons,
OL,11,Fcollide with gases in the Earth's
OL,12,Fatmosphere, typically oxygen and
OL,13,Fnitrogen.
OL,15,FThese collisions emit light at various
OL,16,Fwavelengths, creating vibrant displays
OL,17,Fof colour in the sky, often appearing
