OL,6,FThe Military Wives Choirs have
OL,7,Freleased a moving new song to mark the
OL,8,FKing's forthcoming 76th birthday.
OL,10,FCharles has been honoured with a
OL,11,Flullaby called November Sunday, which
OL,12,Fre-imagines the "chilly, foggy London
OL,13,Fnight" he was born at Buckingham
OL,14,FPalace in 1948, and the hope and joy
OL,15,Fof a recovering post-war Britain.
OL,17,FIt also pays tribute to his late
OL,18,Fmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was
OL,19,Fherself a "military wife", and served
OL,20,Fin the Armed Forces.
