OL,7,FIt's become increasingly clear over
OL,8,Fthe weekend that dropping his titles
OL,9,Fwas not Prince Andrew's decision.
OL,11,FThe statement he released on Friday
OL,12,Fwas the culmination of days of work by
OL,13,Fthe King and Prince William and their
OL,14,Fsenior courtiers and lawyers.
OL,16,FPrince Andrew was left in no doubt
OL,17,Fthat he should jump, or the palace
OL,18,Fwould ensure he would be pushed.

OL,7,FIt was described as the quickest and

OL,9,Fcaused by a member of the Royal Family.
OL,11,FAndrew was continuing to do damage to

OL,13,Fhaving stepped down from the firm
OL,14,Fnearly six years ago.
OL,16,FThat decision, taken by Queen
