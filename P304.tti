OL,12,FIn its latest State of the Climate

OL,14,Falso confirms for the first time that
OL,15,Fsea level rise in the UK is higher
OL,16,Fthan the global average, increasing
OL,17,Frisks of coastal flooding and erosion.
OL,19,FThe report's lead author said the UK's
OL,20,Fclimate "is now notably different to
OL,21,Fwhat it was just a few decades ago."
