OL,6,FPaul Johnson, director of the

OL,8,FStudies, said the public sector would
OL,9,Fbe in pay rises across the economy,
OL,10,Fand would cost an extra #3 billion for
OL,11,Fschools and the NHS alone.
OL,13,FHe told the BBC: "In terms of the
OL,14,Fcost, there isn't a specific number
OL,15,Fthat is budgeted for schools, it's
OL,16,Fprobably 1 or 2%, it's certainly
OL,17,Fnothing like 5.5%, so we'd certainly
OL,18,Fbe looking at at least an additional
OL,19,F#1 billion on schools' costs relative
OL,20,Fto what they're currently expecting.
