OL,7,FThe Royal College of GPs (RCGP) said
OL,8,Fthe spike in cases was particularly

OL,11,FThe RCGP said they are concerned that
OL,12,Fthe "social stigma" that surrounds the
OL,13,Fcondition may put people off seeking
OL,14,Ftreatment.
OL,16,FThey said it was particularly

OL,19,Flike a university campus or shared
OL,20,Faccommodation.

OL,13,FProfessor Hawthorne said scabies can

OL,15,Fwas not a "serious" condition.
OL,17,FShe warned if it was not treated
OL,18,Fproperly it could lead to secondary
