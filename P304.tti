OL,6,FThe Attorney General is set to be
OL,7,Fgrilled by MPs and peers over the
OL,8,Fcollapse of the trial of two alleged
OL,9,FChinese spies last month.
OL,11,FHis appearance comes in the second
OL,12,Fround of hearings by the Joint
OL,13,FCommittee on the National Security
OL,14,FStrategy (JCNSS) as it investigates
OL,15,Fthe collapse of the case against
OL,16,FChristopher Cash and Christopher Berry.
OL,18,FMr Cash, a former parliamentary
OL,19,Fresearcher, and Mr Berry ` who both
OL,20,Fdeny wrongdoing ` had been accused of
OL,21,Fpassing secrets to Beijing.
