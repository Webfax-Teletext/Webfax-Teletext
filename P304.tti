OL,10,Fbefore being swept towards northwest
OL,11,FEurope.
OL,13,F"The resulting low-pressure system
OL,14,Fwill still have the potential to bring
OL,15,Fdisruptive rain and winds to some
OL,16,Fareas, including parts of the UK, from

OL,19,F"There remains much detail to work out
OL,20,Fon the exact track and timing of the
