OL,6,FWhen asked about Vanguard Britannica,
OL,7,FGravill described its activities in
OL,8,Fcautious terms. "The function of the
OL,9,Forganisation," he said, "is to
OL,10,Fadvocate peacefully for various
OL,11,Fpolicies that mainstream groups can
OL,12,Ftake on."

OL,15,Fpromote ideas of remigration and
OL,16,Fracial purity ` and on that point,
OL,17,FGravill was explicit: "I believe in
OL,18,Fhaving an ethnically homogenous
OL,19,Fsociety."

OL,6,FDespite advocating for what amounts to

OL,8,Fwere non-violent.
OL,10,F"I have no interest in killing,
OL,11,Fhurting, violence, terrorism `
OL,12,Fanything like that," he said. "I

OL,17,FIt was a moment of striking double-

OL,6,FBasu, the former head of UK

OL,8,FGravill's words marked a contradiction
OL,9,F` the language of non-violence jarring
OL,10,Fwith his promotion of combat training
OL,11,Fand weapons skills.
OL,13,F"You're describing an organisation

OL,15,Forganise," he said. "So what do you
