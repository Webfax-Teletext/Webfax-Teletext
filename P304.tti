OL,5,FBut, last January, Rishi Sunak decided
OL,6,Fto stake his reputation on a pledge to
OL,7,Fgrow the economy. And at the end of
OL,8,Flast year, the economy found a reverse

OL,11,FLabour is calling it "Rishi's

OL,5,FBut we should remember, the recession

OL,7,Flast year is a very small one compared

OL,5,FThe more important point is the

OL,7,Fgood reasons why that's the case.
OL,9,FAs the chancellor pointed out when I

OL,11,Fpainfully high levels of inflation
OL,12,F(not caused by Rishi Sunak) have
OL,13,Fsqueezed the incomes of households.
OL,15,FHigher interest rates (not set by
OL,16,FRishi Sunak) have left households with

OL,8,F"UK slips into recession" is a

OL,12,FThe prime minister has made a
