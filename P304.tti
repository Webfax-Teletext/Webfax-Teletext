OL,6,FIn the year to March 31, JLR generated
OL,7,Fsales of #29bn. So on a pro rata
OL,8,Fbasis, the shutdown will already have
OL,9,Fseen suppliers lose hundreds of
OL,10,Fmillions of pounds in payments for
OL,11,Fcomponents, maybe as much as a billion
OL,12,Fpounds.
OL,14,FI am not, however, expecting the

OL,16,Fat least not unless the shutdown were
OL,17,Fto threaten its viability. It is a
