OL,6,FBefore the election, the prime
OL,7,Fminister and chancellor insisted their
OL,8,Fnumber one mission was ending 15 years
OL,9,Fof economic stagnation, that they were
OL,10,Fgoing for growth.
OL,12,FIt hasn't worked out. The mildly
OL,13,Fgrowing economy they inherited in July
OL,14,Fhas reverted to flat-lining type,
OL,15,Fpartly because Rachel Reeves and
OL,16,FAngela Rayner have heaped additional
OL,17,Fcosts on businesses, with their #25bn
OL,18,Femployer national insurance increase
OL,19,Fand a raft of new employment
OL,20,Frestrictions.
