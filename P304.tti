OL,6,FThe Royal Horticultural Society (RHS)
OL,7,Fhas unveiled emergency plans to
OL,8,Fprotect its gardens from the potential
OL,9,Ffor major water shortages in the
OL,10,Ffuture.
OL,12,FThe environmental charity, which owns
OL,13,Fand operates five renowned public
OL,14,Fgardens in England, said on Saturday
OL,15,Fit will invest in more water capture
OL,16,Fand management projects than anything
OL,17,Felse in 2026 following severe droughts
OL,18,Flast year.

OL,8,Falso urging gardeners to mirror the
OL,9,Fmeasures it will take this winter and
OL,10,Fspring to prepare for as much rain as
OL,11,Fpossible.
OL,13,FThis includes preparing the soil with
OL,14,Fhollow tining, chop-and-drop and
OL,15,Fmulching, creating rain gardens,
OL,16,Finstalling rainwater storage
