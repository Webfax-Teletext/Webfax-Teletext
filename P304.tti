OL,6,FJustice Department prosecutors, citing
OL,7,Flongstanding department guidance that
OL,8,Fa sitting president cannot be
OL,9,Fprosecuted, said the department's
OL,10,Fposition is that "the Constitution

OL,14,F"That prohibition is categorical and

OL,18,Fthe prosecution, which the Government
OL,19,Fstands fully behind," the prosecutors
OL,20,Fwrote in Monday's court filing.
