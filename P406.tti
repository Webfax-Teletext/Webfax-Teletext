OL,6,FAn iconic LGTBQ+ venue in London is up
OL,7,Ffor sale as the owner cites
OL,8,F'licensing' and 'a lack of care for
OL,9,Fhospitality'.
OL,11,FThe owner Jeremy Joseph says it was a
OL,12,F"tough" decision, but felt like it was
OL,13,Fnecessary following licensing
OL,14,Fdecisions by Westminster council.
OL,16,FThis comes after the nightclub,
OL,17,FHeaven, also owned by Jeremy Joseph

OL,9,FJeremy said: "I was clear to

OL,11,Fthat if they closed Heaven for even a
