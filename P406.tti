OL,8,Fby London Zoo.
OL,10,FBrother-sister duo, Gizmo and Kiwi,
OL,11,Fmoved to the Zoo in May 2025.
OL,13,FIt was only meant to be a temporary
OL,14,Fstay, but the keepers said they
OL,15,Fsettled in so well that a permanent
OL,16,Fhome was built.
OL,18,FThe rodents moved into their new
OL,19,Fluxury space - which features two
OL,20,Fpools, mud baths and climate control
OL,21,Fzones - on Tuesday.

OL,6,FZookeeper Owen Shrewsbury said: "It's
OL,7,Fcalled Capy-spa-ra. They can have a
OL,8,Fnice day out, relax in their pond,
OL,9,Fhave a comfy day in their beds or
OL,10,Fwallow in their muddy wallow.
OL,12,F"We've got a good variety of terrain,
OL,13,Fwe have a big mound - under it they've
OL,14,Fgot a nice comfy bed, which has a
OL,15,Fheater for them.

OL,6,F"We've got a wallow just by the

OL,8,Fit's a bit warmer, they love to wallow
OL,9,Faround so they're all caked in mud.
OL,10,FThis is also to prevent parasites and
OL,11,Ftics that are typically in the wild."
OL,13,FThe Capybaras seem to be enjoying
OL,14,Ftheir new accommodation, but it's
OL,15,Foften hard to tell, according to Owen.

OL,6,FHe said: "The capybara is completely
