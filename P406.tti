OL,7,Fprosecutor Joel Smith KC said the boys
OL,8,Fhad been in contact over Snapchat
OL,9,Fregarding the defendant's desire to
OL,10,Fbuy a moped from Kamari.
OL,12,FThey had been "haggling" over a price
OL,13,Fand Kamari wanted #180 for it, jurors
OL,14,Fwere told.
OL,16,F"It seems pretty clear from the
OL,17,Fmessages that the moped was going to
OL,18,Fbe a stolen one," Mr Smith said.

OL,10,FMr Smith said: "It seems that when
