OL,6,FLondon's Evening Standard newspaper is
OL,7,Fset to scrap its daily editions in
OL,8,Ffavour of a weekly publication.
OL,10,FThe newspaper is currently circulated
OL,11,Ffree of charge at the capital's
OL,12,FUnderground stations from Monday to
OL,13,FFriday.
OL,15,FBut in a memo sent to staff the
OL,16,Fcompany said it has been making
OL,17,F"substantial losses" with its current
OL,18,Foperation, which has prompted the need
OL,19,Ffor a change of direction.
