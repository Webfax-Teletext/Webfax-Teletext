OL,6,FAfter being bullied at school, her
OL,7,Fmental health spiralled and her eating
OL,8,Fhabits changed. At 13 years old she
OL,9,Fwas diagnosed with anorexia.JShe said:
OL,10,F"I never had the teenage life that I
OL,11,Fwanted. It impacted my school. So I
OL,12,Ffelt like I'd lost a lot of my life.
OL,13,FIt was really a place where I couldn't
OL,14,Fget myself out of at such a young age
OL,15,Fbecause I had no idea what was going
