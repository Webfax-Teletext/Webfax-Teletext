OL,7,FA 51-year-old man in Sussex fears he
OL,8,Fwill have to die in hospital if his
OL,9,Flocal hospice can't offer him a bed
OL,10,Fbecause of a lack of funding.
OL,12,FMarc Valentine was diagnosed with a
OL,13,Frare progressive cancer five years
OL,14,Fago. Since then, staff at Martlets
OL,15,FHospice in Hove have become like
OL,16,Ffamily to him.
OL,18,FBut the hospice says increased costs
OL,19,Fand a lack of financial support from
OL,20,Fthe government mean it might have to
OL,21,Freduce its services.

OL,11,FHe added: "The hospice can't sit there

OL,19,Fbecause I don't want to die at home
OL,20,Fand I don't want to die in a hospital."

OL,7,FBeyond the impact on patients, Mr
OL,8,FPalma says reduced hospice care will
OL,9,Falso add pressure on the NHS.
OL,11,F"The knock-on effect is that we place
OL,12,Fa greater burden on the NHS. As
OL,13,Feveryone knows with the flu outbreak
OL,14,Frecently, the burden couldn't be
OL,15,Fhigher on the NHS as it is," he said.
OL,17,F"So that's at breaking point, and with
OL,18,Fus having to do less because of
OL,19,Ffunding, there will be an even further
OL,20,Fburden (...) But the human cost is the
OL,21,Freally devastating part of this".
