OL,6,FFor the first time, a native pine
OL,7,Fmarten has been captured on camera on
OL,8,Fthe Longleat estate in Wiltshire.
OL,10,FPine martens were almost extinct in
OL,11,FBritain by the beginning of the 20th
OL,12,Fcentury, but due to successful
OL,13,Freintroduction programmes, their
OL,14,Fpopulations are slowly expanding.
OL,16,FDr Tom Lewis, conservation and
OL,17,Fresearch manager, said: "What's
OL,18,Fparticularly exciting is that the pine
OL,19,Fmarten at Longleat has appeared
OL,20,Fnaturally rather than through a re-
OL,21,Fintroduction programme.

OL,16,Fare using the woods or just passing
