OL,9,FAn Anglo-Saxon expert from the
OL,10,FUniversity of Oxford may have solved
OL,11,Fthe mystery of why valuable artefacts
OL,12,Ffrom across the world were discovered
OL,13,Fin a royal burial chamber in Essex.
OL,15,FThe excavation at Prittlewell, near
OL,16,FSouthend, has long been hailed as the
OL,17,FUK's answer to Tutankhamun's Tomb but
OL,18,Fmore than twenty years after the
OL,19,Fchamber was first uncovered, some of
OL,20,Fthe artefacts are revealing new

OL,6,FDr Helen Gittos believes the treasures
OL,7,Fweren't just traded or gifted, as

OL,10,FInstead, their presence could reflect
OL,11,Fthe Anglo-Saxons' own travels as

OL,13,Freward following a 6th century

OL,12,FHe was buried in the period c.580`605,
OL,13,Fperhaps in the earlier part of that

OL,16,FAmong the objects that were placed in

OL,6,FDr Gittos said: "We tend to think of
OL,7,Fearly medieval Briton as being
OL,8,Freasonably isolated. We tend to think
OL,9,Fabout her history as quite local, not
OL,10,Fso connected and one of the things
OL,11,Fthis does is show us how connected
OL,12,Fthis world was over large distances."
OL,14,FRobert Sharp from Southend Museum,
OL,15,Fwhere the artefacts are on display,
OL,16,Fsaid: "It's still someone's life at
OL,17,Fthe end of the day and what Dr Gittos'
OL,18,Fresearch has done is add some more
