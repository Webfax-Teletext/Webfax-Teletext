OL,7,Fdisbelief, you're like, that can't

OL,9,FBut I knew when I saw the sock because
OL,10,Fnothing else would explain that sock
OL,11,Fand that amount of damage to her toe."
OL,13,FHer mum, Joan, lives in a council-
OL,14,Fowned house. She's bed-bound and has
OL,15,Fno feeling in her legs.
OL,17,FIn April, Andrea had contacted

OL,19,Fafter seeing a rat run across the

OL,6,FShe was told it would cost her mum
OL,7,Fnearly #300 for pest control to come
OL,8,Fand it would more than take two weeks.
OL,10,FSo she decided to lay traps and rat
OL,11,Fpoison herself, hoping it would

OL,14,FThen, on May 20th, Scott received a

OL,17,F"When I came in, I saw the carers were

OL,18,Fsort it.
