OL,5,FThe Pollen Season
OL,7,FRunning from March to the end of
OL,8,FSeptember, the pollen season is split
OL,9,Finto three main categories
OL,11,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,12,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,13,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,14,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,15,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,16,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.
OL,18,FThe immune system normally defends the
OL,19,Fbody against harmful invaders, such as
OL,20,Fviruses and bacteria, to ward off
OL,21,Fillnesses.

OL,5,FSome peoples immune system mistakenly
OL,6,Fidentify harmless pollen as a threat
OL,7,Fto the body and tries to fight it by
OL,8,Freleasing a chemical. We call this an
OL,9,Fallergic reaction, which can lead to a
OL,10,Fnumber of irritating symptoms such as
OL,12,FThe Pollen Count
OL,14,FA pollen count is generated by
OL,15,Fmeasuring the number of pollen grains
OL,16,Fin a given volume of air, using a

OL,5,FPollen counts tend to be higher in the
OL,6,Fearly morning and late evening,
OL,7,Falthough they can sometimes be high
OL,8,Fall day long.
OL,10,FIf the grass is damp, the pollen peak
OL,11,Fwill be later in the morning because
OL,12,Fthe water evaporates before the pollen
OL,13,Fis released.
OL,15,FSome grasses release their pollen in

OL,17,Fduring the day and then descends at
OL,18,Fnight, as the air cools.

OL,5,FIn rural areas, the evening peak tends

OL,7,Fthe city, where the air stays warmer

OL,14,FSunny days favour higher pollen counts
