OL,8,Fencouraging others to take an alarm
OL,9,Fwith them as part of a Pack Safe

OL,12,FHudson's mum, Cathy Foley said:
OL,13,F"Hudson had been travelling for three
OL,14,Fmonths and while we had heard from him
OL,15,Fon a regular basis that made it seem
OL,16,Funreal.
OL,18,F"Even now coming up to the first
OL,19,Fanniversary, I still can't believe he
OL,20,Fis no longer with us. He was taken so
OL,21,Fquickly."

OL,6,FHudson's dad, Paul Foley said: "It has
OL,7,Fbeen a difficult year, probably more
OL,8,Fso because everything is a first - his
OL,9,Fbirthday, Christmas and all those type
OL,10,Fof things. The one saving grace, for
OL,11,Fme, is we did so much together."
OL,13,FCarbon monoxide poisoning is typically
OL,14,Fcaused by a faulty boiler, cooker or
OL,15,Fheater giving off a deadly gas, which
OL,16,Fyou can't see or smell.
OL,18,FApproximately 30,000 people die every
OL,19,Fyear from carbon monoxide poisoning,
OL,20,Faccording to The Lancet.
