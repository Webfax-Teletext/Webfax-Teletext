OL,3,CRoyal Mail post arrives 'once a week
OL,4,Cif we're lucky', town residents say
OL,6,FDecades ago billions of letters were
OL,7,Fdelivered each year but nowadays,
OL,8,Fnumbers have dramatically reduced
OL,9,Fmeaning the service is far less
OL,10,Fprofitable for Royal Mail.
OL,12,FIn the last two years, the regulator
OL,13,FOfcom has fined Royal Mail more than
OL,14,F#15m for missed delivery targets.
OL,16,FOfcom is due to decide whether to
OL,17,Fallow the firm to reduce the number of
OL,18,Fdays it delivers second class post so
OL,19,Fthe company can save millions and
OL,20,Ffocus on improving reliability for
OL,21,Ffirst class letters.
