OL,7,Fwhen he "battled" a "rambunctious"
OL,8,Fseagull after it became stuck in a
OL,9,Fdisused chimney flue.
OL,11,FNeil Jarrett, 48, Gosport in
OL,12,FHampshire, filmed the moment a

OL,6,FMr Jarrett, ex-Royal Navy, received a
OL,7,Fphone call from a concerned resident
OL,8,Fafter she noticed feathers falling
OL,9,Ffrom her unused chimney flue, which he
OL,10,Finitially suspected might have been a
OL,11,Fdead animal.
OL,13,F"I said the chances are, because we

OL,15,Fit's probably weather affects on an
OL,16,Fold chimney," the chimney sweep said.
