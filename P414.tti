OL,6,FHead keeper, Gemma Romanis, commented:
OL,7,F"Of course, none of our animals are
OL,8,Factually 'naughty' in the way we'd use
OL,9,Fthe word for humans, but some of them
OL,10,Fdefinitely have stronger personalities
OL,11,Fand don't like to play by the rules,
OL,12,Fso for a bit of festive fun our
OL,13,Ftradition is for the team to vote on
OL,14,Fthe lists ` and this year there's a
OL,15,Fnew 'naughty' winner that might
OL,16,Fsurprise everyone!"
