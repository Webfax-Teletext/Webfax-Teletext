OL,6,FWhen Faye Louise was given the
OL,7,Fshocking news that she had cancer,
OL,8,Faged 38, she began planning her
OL,9,Ffuneral.J"In my mind, there was only
OL,10,Fone outcome. I'd lost my mum to bowel
OL,11,Fcancer 18 months earlier. I thought
OL,12,Fhistory would repeat itself so I kept
OL,13,Flooking at funeral plans. I told my
OL,14,Fpartner Will I probably wouldn't make
OL,15,F50, or even 45," said Faye.JBut
OL,16,Fthankfully, because of treatment, Faye
OL,17,Fis now cancer free and is starting to
OL,18,Frebuild her life. And, grateful for
OL,19,Fthe second chance she's been given,
OL,20,Fshe is launching Cancer Research UK's
OL,21,F2024 Race for Life season and calling
OL,22,Fon others to join her.

OL,6,FFaye had been fit and well up until
OL,7,FSpring 2023 when she began to have
OL,8,Fpains and bloating which she put down
OL,9,Fto period problems. Her GP asked if
OL,10,Fshe had ever experienced appendicitis
OL,11,Fand Faye told her she hadn't. The GP
OL,12,Freferred her for an ultrasound which
OL,13,Frevealed an ovarian cyst filled with
OL,14,Ffluid.JDuring an operation to remove
OL,15,Fthe cyst, surgeons found a large
OL,16,Ftumour on her appendix. She was
OL,17,Fdiagnosed with the very rare and
OL,18,Fpotentially fatal pseudomyxoma
OL,19,Fperitonei (PMP).

OL,6,FFaye needed an operation colloquially
OL,7,Fknown as 'the mother of all surgeries,
