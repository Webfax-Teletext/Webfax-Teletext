OL,7,FOxfordshire Museum, said: "Archie is
OL,8,Fnow 114 years old, so he's doing very
OL,9,Fwell for an old bear.
OL,11,F"At some point during the 1930s,
OL,12,FArchie was upgraded to be called
OL,13,FArchie Ormsby Gore, so he was given a
OL,14,Fslightly more grandiose title.
OL,16,F"Betjeman would take Archie everywhere
OL,17,Fwith him, he would go to fancy
OL,18,Fluncheons, dinner parties and parties
OL,19,Fwith England's aristocratic elite."
