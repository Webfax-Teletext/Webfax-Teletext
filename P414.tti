OL,6,FWATCH: A tank is driven through the
OL,7,Fstreets of Basingstoke after being
OL,8,Fparked in a Wickes car park for more
OL,9,Fthan 40 days.
OL,11,FA disgruntled customer, who made
OL,12,Fheadlines when he parked a tank in
OL,13,Ffront of a Wickes store in
OL,14,FBasingstoke, has been forced to remove
OL,15,Fthe vehicle after being served a court
OL,16,Forder.
OL,18,FPaul Gibbons from Kingsclere spent
OL,19,F#25,000 on a new kitchen, which he
OL,20,Fclaims was left incomplete and
OL,21,Fdangerous.

OL,4,Cstore forced to remove it
OL,6,FHe said he's been left in a difficult
OL,7,Ffinancial situation, as the state of
OL,8,Fthe kitchen means he can't rent out
OL,9,Fhis home and downsize, as originally
OL,10,Fplanned.
OL,12,FIn retaliation, Mr Gibbons rented the
OL,13,Ftank from a friend and parked it
OL,14,Foutside the Wickes store, where it has
OL,15,Fbeen since December.
OL,17,FBut a court order giving Mr Gibbons 14
OL,18,Fdays to move the vehicle from the
OL,19,Fpremise, means he had to arrange for
OL,20,Fthe tank to be returned to its owner.
