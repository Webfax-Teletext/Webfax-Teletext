OL,5,F"We went after a storm in the Channel
OL,6,Fand I went over about two weeks
OL,7,Fafterwards."
OL,9,FMr Parker remembers landing on Sword
OL,10,FBeach via a larger ship which needed
OL,11,Fto wait for a tide.
OL,13,FThe first job for his comrades was to
OL,14,Ffind somewhere to base themselves.
OL,16,FMr Parker added: "We had to dig in as
OL,17,Fquick as we could and make a defensive
OL,18,Fposition. A machine gun post as well.
OL,20,F"And be up at half past four in the
OL,21,Fmorning in case of a German attack."

OL,5,FThat air bombardment never came, and
OL,6,Fthe job he and others did, was to fix
OL,7,Fships and in particular - landing
OL,8,Fcraft that had got stuck in the sand
OL,9,For shallow water.
OL,11,F"People were stuck in the water and
OL,12,Fcouldn't start their landing craft -
OL,13,For we had to get men out of
OL,14,Fsomewhere," he said.
OL,16,F"We did all the odd jobs. And there
OL,17,Fwere a lot of troops in Normandy
OL,18,Fwaiting to go, waiting for the
OL,19,Fbreakthrough.

OL,5,F"We would go out and find out the
OL,6,Freason why a landing craft was stuck.
OL,7,FSometimes it was because the petrol
OL,8,Fhadn't been turned on.
OL,10,F"Space was limited and there were so
OL,11,Fmany men coming in."
OL,13,FThis work ensured there were fewer
OL,14,Fblockages on the beaches at a time
