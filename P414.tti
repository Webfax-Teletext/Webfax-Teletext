OL,6,FThe building of one of the country's
OL,7,Flargest reservoirs is now one step
OL,8,Fcloser after a judicial review was
OL,9,Fdismissed by the High Court.
OL,11,FThe controversial Thames Water
OL,12,Freservoir near Abingdon is estimated
OL,13,Fto be the size of Gatwick Airport,
OL,14,Fwith walls as high as several double-
OL,15,Fdecker buses.
OL,17,FThe water firm said it will help with
OL,18,Fincreasing demand and climate change
OL,19,Fbut some locals are concerned about
OL,20,Fthe safety of the design and the loss
OL,21,Fof a large area of countryside.
