OL,7,Fsaid: "Ear cropping is a painful and
OL,8,Fillegal procedure that carries no

OL,10,Fwas a really concerning case.JAfter we

OL,12,Ftaking place at these kennels, we
OL,13,Fspoke to police who obtained a warrant
OL,14,Fand executed it on 18 May 2023.
OL,15,FOfficers found a number of adult dogs,
