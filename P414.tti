OL,7,FHe had parked it outside a shop in the

OL,10,Fback outside, it was gone.
OL,12,F"I just went cold all over," Tony
OL,13,Fsaid. "I just stood there. I could not
OL,14,Fbelieve it was gone."
OL,16,FAn elderly couple parked nearby told
OL,17,Fhim they saw three young men take the
OL,18,Fscooter and drive off down the High
OL,19,FStreet. They helped Tony contact the
OL,20,Fpolice and gave him a lift home.

OL,7,FHis wife's care home has loaned him a
OL,8,Fscooter so he can continue visiting
OL,9,Fher, but he fears that arrangement
OL,10,Fwon't last long. "Half my life savings
