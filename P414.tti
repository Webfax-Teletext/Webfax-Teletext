OL,12,FLucy Isaac, from Sonning, was 12 weeks
OL,13,Fpregnant when she was diagnosed with

OL,15,Fscan.
OL,17,FHer pregnancy was too far advanced for
OL,18,Fkeyhole surgery to be an option, but
OL,19,Fsurgeons were also worried that if
OL,20,Fthey waited until her baby was born,
OL,21,Fthe cancer may have spread.

OL,7,Ftherefore suggested a rare procedure
OL,8,Fthat involved lifting Lucy's womb out
OL,9,Fof her abdomen, still containing her

OL,11,Fto examine and remove the cancerous
OL,12,Fcells.
OL,14,FWhile it was out of her body, Lucy's
OL,15,Fwomb was kept at a temperature and in
