OL,6,FCanterbury Cathedral attracts around
OL,7,F350,000 visitors a year, but from
OL,8,Ftoday they will be able to take a tour
OL,9,Fof its historic precinct grounds for
OL,10,Ffree.
OL,12,FIt's hoped the scheme will help more
OL,13,Fpeople enjoy the unique place of
OL,14,Fworship - only having to pay to look
OL,15,Finside the Cathedral itself.
OL,17,FIt's one of a series of changes being
OL,18,Fmade by the new Dean of Canterbury,
OL,19,Fwho's also introduced a policy to
OL,20,Fallow dogs into the building for the
OL,21,Ffirst time.

OL,6,F"People often say of this place that
OL,7,Fyou look at the stones and in the
OL,8,Fstories of Canterbury Cathedral, and
OL,9,Fyou find the history of England," The
OL,10,FVery Rev Dr David Monteith, Dean of
OL,11,FCanterbury, said.
OL,13,F"And the key thing is that that's not
OL,14,Fjust something in the past, but that
OL,15,Fhistory lives in us. And we then
OL,16,Fbecome part of that story as we engage
OL,17,Fwith it, we support it, and as we move
OL,18,Fforward.

OL,6,F"As far as Barney, our Lurcher, is
OL,7,Fconcerned, the precincts belong to
OL,8,Fhim. So he's going to share them with
OL,9,Feverybody.
OL,11,F"And, of course, since the summertime,
OL,12,Fwe've had dogs coming into the
OL,13,Fcathedral itself. And so he just keeps
