OL,6,FAt a cabinet meeting on Thursday 23
OL,7,FJanuary, Councillor Sankey said that a
OL,8,Fderelict i360 would become like the
OL,9,FWest Pier but without its "rugged
OL,10,Frustiness" loved by many.
OL,12,FShe said: "If the i360 can operate
OL,13,Fagain then it can help bring in
OL,14,Fbusiness rates.
OL,16,F"And if we proceed with the
OL,17,Frecommended buyer that has come
OL,18,Fforward, the city council will get a
OL,19,Fsmall share of future revenues.
