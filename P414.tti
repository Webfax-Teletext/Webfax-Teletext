OL,13,Fwhich is thought to have been built

OL,7,F"We're hoping to learn what function

OL,13,F"Once we've finished fully recording

OL,7,FThe archaeology team say there are
OL,8,Fquite a lot of Roman sites across
OL,9,FOxfordshire, as it was well populated
OL,10,Fand there was a lot of colonisation.
OL,12,FFrancesca Giarelli, project officer,
OL,13,FRed River Archaeology said: "We
OL,14,Fstarted from quite far away from this
OL,15,Fsite.
OL,17,F"The finds were getting richer and
OL,18,Fmore abundant the closer we got to the

OL,7,F"At some point in history we

OL,9,FThere is no record of it in any of the

OL,12,F"The most interesting fact is that we
OL,13,Fhave found painted plaster and some of

OL,16,F"The blue pigment comes from
