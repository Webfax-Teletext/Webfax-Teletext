OL,6,FIn the early hours of D-Day the ship
OL,7,Flaid marker buoys ahead of the first
OL,8,Flandings by the Canadians. This was to
OL,9,Flet the troop-carrying vessels know
OL,10,Fwhich section they had to go to.
OL,12,FHe said: "The idea was there were five
OL,13,Fbeachheads heavily armed and we had
OL,14,FJuno and we were going to have to take
OL,15,Flots of buoys on board and lead a
OL,16,Fregiment of Canadian soldiers there.

OL,6,F"We got all the kit and went to lay a
OL,7,Ftrail with the buoys all the way to
OL,8,FJuno. Astral was a navigator and its
OL,9,Fjob was to make sure the Canadians
OL,10,Fwent to the right beachhead.
OL,12,F"And suddenly the warships started
OL,13,Ffiring their guns at the beachhead and
OL,14,Fit was like trains going over your
OL,15,Fhead.
OL,17,F"All the soldiers were in the landing

OL,6,F"Once they were in the shallow waters
OL,7,Fthe ramps came down on all the landing

OL,11,Fdeal with the Germans who were firing
OL,12,Fat them.
OL,14,F"I was in the wireless room receiving
OL,15,Fcalls and instructions and was able to
OL,16,Fsee what was happening. The Canadians
OL,17,Fwere very unfortunate. (The Germans)
OL,18,Fwere firing at them and not us and if
OL,19,Fthey fell in the water with their
OL,20,Fpacks on them they just drowned. The
OL,21,Fcarnage was frightful.
