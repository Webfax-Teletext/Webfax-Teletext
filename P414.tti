OL,6,FIt's the idea of keen boxer Chris
OL,7,FPeskett who says most clubs don't know
OL,8,Fhow to deal with the disabled, which
OL,9,Fcan leave them feeling unwelcome.
OL,11,FHe himself has learning disabilities
OL,12,Ffollowing a brain tumour.
OL,14,FHe suggested a dedicated session to
OL,15,Fthe owner of the club, and they now
OL,16,Ftake place every Saturday lunchtime.
OL,18,F"What they get out of it is something
OL,19,Fto get them out and about," says Chris.
