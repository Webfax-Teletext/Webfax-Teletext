OL,7,FA #317 million M25 project which has
OL,8,Fcaused severe congestion for several
OL,9,Fyears has been delayed by around nine
OL,10,Fmonths because of 'extreme weather'.
OL,12,FNational Highways said its work to
OL,13,Fimprove Junction 10 of the motorway in
OL,14,FSurrey, initially scheduled to end
OL,15,Fthis summer, will now not finish until
OL,16,Fspring next year.
OL,18,FThe Government-owned company insisted
OL,19,Fthis 'does not mean continued heavy
OL,20,Fcongestion' and 'in practical terms
OL,21,Fmost road users will not be affected'.
