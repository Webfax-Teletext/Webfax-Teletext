OL,6,FIn what is a rather unusual move,

OL,8,Fgraffiti on a bridge in Sandhurst,
OL,9,FBerkshire.
OL,11,FAffectionately known as the 'Happy
OL,12,FChristmas Bridge', the graffiti has
OL,13,Fbecome a local landmark.
OL,15,FBut the words have been fading, so it
OL,16,Fhas been given a festive facelift.
OL,18,FIt was originally painted in the 1960s
OL,19,Fby a group of college students on
OL,20,Ftheir way back from a Christmas party.
