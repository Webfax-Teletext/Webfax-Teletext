OL,6,FThe boss of a Solent ferry company has
OL,7,Fhailed a "new era" of flying high-
OL,8,Fspeed electric ferries in the UK.
OL,10,FRed Funnel, which runs passenger and
OL,11,Fvehicle services between Southampton
OL,12,Fand Cowes, Isle of Wight, has
OL,13,Fpartnered with Belfast-based firm
OL,14,FArtemis Technologies to launch a zero-
OL,15,Femissions foiling vessel next year.
OL,17,FThe 150-passenger ferry, which costs
OL,18,Fbetween #10-12 million to build, uses
OL,19,Fadvanced hydrofoil technology and
OL,20,Fmodularised battery systems.
