OL,7,FA woman from Oxfordshire has told how
OL,8,Fher mother died heartbroken because
OL,9,Fshe didn't see her receive the justice
OL,10,Fshe believed she deserved.
OL,12,FAmanda Miles from Didcot said her
OL,13,Fmother Edna Summerell was given the
OL,14,Fhormone pregnancy test Primodos in
OL,15,F1973.
OL,17,FThe family say it led to Amanda being
OL,18,Fborn with birth defects including two
OL,19,Fholes in the heart and one leg longer
OL,20,Fthan the other.
