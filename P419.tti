OL,7,FThe Pothole Partnership was formed two

OL,10,FCouncil. It is calling for a shift in
OL,11,Fhow local authorities approach
OL,12,Frepairs, as it says money is being
OL,13,Fwasted on short-term fixes.
OL,15,FIt says that in many cases, the same
OL,16,Fsections of road are revisited within
OL,17,Fa year as previous repairs fail. The
OL,18,Fgroup wants to see the introduction of
OL,19,Fa minimum five-year warranty on every

OL,7,FThe Basingstoke-based AA motoring
OL,8,Forganisation has released figures
OL,9,Fshowing they were called to more than
OL,10,Fhalf a million pothole-related
OL,11,Fincidents last year. AA President
OL,12,FEdmund King supports the move and
OL,13,Fsaid: "If a pothole reappears within
OL,14,Ffive years, it would be repaired for
OL,15,Ffree of charge under the warranty.
OL,17,F"This proposal has the potential to
OL,18,Fsave money for council tax payers but
OL,19,Fmore importantly, ensure the pothole
OL,20,Fis repaired correctly first time."
