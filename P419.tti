OL,11,F"This was identified as a risk and was
OL,12,Fdue for remedial work as part of
OL,13,Fconstruction.
OL,15,F"The reason the work is being
OL,16,Fundertaken in the first place is
OL,17,Fbecause the walls around this end of
OL,18,Fthe harbour are in poor condition and
OL,19,Fare at the end of their life.
