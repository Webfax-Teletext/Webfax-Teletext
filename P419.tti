OL,9,Fbecause there's thousands of young

OL,6,FWhile manning a gun platform at the
OL,7,Fage of 19, the ship was hit and sunk
OL,8,Foff the Normandy coast.
OL,10,FStan said: "I went over the side with
OL,11,Fthe gun and platform. We went up in
OL,12,Fthe air and away from the ship and
OL,13,Ffinally came down, but the explosion
OL,14,Fwas so severe that it detached the gun
