OL,7,FThe Kent Saheli group was started 33
OL,8,Fyears ago by Daya Kans to support
OL,9,Fwomen who arrived from India to start
OL,10,Fa new life. 'Saheli' means female
OL,11,Ffriendship in Hindi and Punjabi.
OL,13,FDaya Kans said: "I came to England in
OL,14,F1964. I was a teacher in India, and I
OL,15,Frealised that the ladies who didn't go
OL,16,Fto school in India were so isolated.
OL,17,FThey'd just learnt a few words like
OL,18,F'you', 'me', 'thank you', 'milk,'
OL,19,F'bread'. That was their conversation
OL,20,Fwith the outside world."
