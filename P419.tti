OL,6,FThe only other example of this type of
OL,7,Fsword mount was acquired by the
OL,8,FBritish Museum in 1981. However, this
OL,9,Ffirst find was incomplete making the
OL,10,FStopham mount a very rare and
OL,11,Fincredibly important discovery for the
OL,12,Farea.
OL,14,FThe Stopham mount, which measures
OL,15,F16.14mm in height, was likely attached
OL,16,Fto a strap that would have helped
OL,17,Fsecure a sword to its scabbard (or
OL,18,Fsheath).
