OL,6,FThey went to a dark, secluded part of
OL,7,Fthe beach and Mr Eubank told jurors
OL,8,Fduring the trial that what took place
OL,9,Fwas "all very fluent and very
OL,10,Fconsensual".
OL,12,FThe prosecution had said that the girl
OL,13,Fhad been drinking vodka with friends
OL,14,Fcelebrating a birthday and had never
OL,15,Fbeen drunk like that before and
OL,16,F"couldn't see straight".
OL,18,FBut Mr Eubank, who said he had not
OL,19,Fdrunk alcohol that night, said "she
OL,20,Flooked completely sober" during their
OL,21,Fchat near the beach.
