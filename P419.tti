OL,6,FA 13-year-old dog from Kent is 'lucky
OL,7,Fto be alive' according to vets after
OL,8,Fswallowing a nicotine-filled vape pod
OL,9,Fduring a walk.
OL,11,FDolly, the Bichon Frise, needed a
OL,12,F'major operation' to remove the vape
OL,13,Fcartridge from her stomach.
OL,15,FPennard Vets in Maidstone who treated
OL,16,FDolly are urging people to be aware of
OL,17,Fthe dangers of e-cigarettes and say
OL,18,Fpets can be attracted to the sweet
OL,19,Fscents.
