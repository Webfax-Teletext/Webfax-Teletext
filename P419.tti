OL,11,FWorking in great secrecy the aim was
OL,12,Fto help landing craft crew and then
OL,13,Fsoldiers on the beaches instantly
OL,14,Fidentify where they were.

OL,6,F"And to make sure she was in the right
OL,7,Fplace where they had to be I had some
OL,8,Fdetailed maps I made for the officers.
OL,10,F"They wanted to know exactly where
OL,11,Fthey were. So the whole of the walls
OL,12,Faround my office were big-scale maps
OL,13,Fof the French coast.
OL,15,F"Each compass bearing on the picture I
OL,16,Fhad to draw a special map so as you
OL,17,Flooked out the window you could see a
OL,18,Frailway or a church or some big site
OL,19,Fthat we had put on the map so they
OL,20,Fcould identify themselves as where
OL,21,Fthey were.

OL,7,Fto see these people and whatever they
OL,8,Fwere busy doing.
OL,10,F"That's why the maps were important I
OL,11,Fsuppose. I felt it was something

OL,14,F"I didn't want to do anything that was
