OL,7,Fon the proposed new animal welfare bill
OL,9,FThe Winchester MP has proposed a new
OL,10,Flaw which will help tackle the issue
OL,11,Fof illegal puppy smuggling and 'cruel
OL,12,Fpet practices'.
OL,14,FFormer vet, Danny Chambers, says that
OL,15,Fsome owners still carry out illegal
OL,16,Fpet mutilations, using a loophole by
OL,17,Fclaiming the dog was imported after
OL,18,Fhaving the procedures outside the

OL,6,FDanny Chambers MP said: "As a vet,
OL,7,FI've treated many dogs with cruelly

OL,9,Fthem physically scarred and
OL,10,Femotionally traumatised. There is no

OL,14,F"But this bill is about more than
OL,15,Fanimal welfare. We're also protecting
OL,16,Fpublic health because dogs that have
OL,17,Fbeen smuggled into the UK could be
OL,18,Fcarrying terrifying diseases that
OL,19,Faffect humans, such as rabies.
