OL,7,FMr Kertesz estimated the infection was
OL,8,Flikely caused by a trauma sustained
OL,9,Fwhen Lira was between 1.5 and 2 years
OL,10,Fold, leading to bacteria producing
OL,11,Ftoxins inside the tooth.
OL,13,FHe said: "When I examined Lira's jaw
OL,14,Fand mouth, I could see immediately
OL,15,Fthat the broken tooth was severely
OL,16,Finfected.
OL,18,F"My philosophy is that non-human
OL,19,Fdental problems need to be treated in
OL,20,Fthe most predictable, the least
OL,21,Finvasive and safest way.

OL,14,FThe extracted tooth measured 8cm in
