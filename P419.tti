OL,6,FStaff at a day centre that looks after
OL,7,Fvulnerable people in Sussex say
OL,8,Fthey're "praying for a miracle" as
OL,9,Fthey face closing down because of a
OL,10,Flack of money.
OL,12,FTerry's Place in Chichester is named
OL,13,Fafter Terry Senn - a local man with
OL,14,Fdementia who left money in his will to
OL,15,Fhelp others with the disease.
OL,17,FBut two years after the day centre
OL,18,Fopened his legacy has run out and,
OL,19,Funless #100,000 can be found, it will
OL,20,Fshut its doors on Friday.

OL,6,FLisa Kail, CEO of Terry's Place, said:
OL,7,F"From the day we opened our doors we
OL,8,Fwere heavily reliant on fundraising
OL,9,Fbut we've seen over this last year
OL,10,Fthat the guarantee of receiving funds
OL,11,Ffrom fundraising is just not there.
OL,13,F"We have to close our doors unless we
OL,14,Fhave a miracle which is what myself
OL,15,Fand our team and our carers are all
OL,16,Fpraying for."
OL,18,FOne person who has benefitted from the
OL,19,Fcentre is Maz Taylor who said it's
OL,20,Fbeen a "lifeline" for her.

OL,6,FShe said: "I started coming
OL,7,Fapproximately two years ago just after
OL,8,Fit opened - Terry's Place. I was in a
OL,9,Fvery bad place at the time.
OL,11,F"I'd suffered mental breakdown. It's
