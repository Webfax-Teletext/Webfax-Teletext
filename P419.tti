OL,6,FThe deployment to the South coast

OL,9,Ffast and heavily armed motor torpedo
OL,10,Fboats.
OL,12,F"They were causing a lot of damage and
OL,13,Fnuisance to the Allied forces that

OL,15,Fhe said.

OL,6,F"One American general was so concerned
OL,7,Fthinking what would happen on D-Day if
OL,8,Fthere was a mass attack by these E-
OL,9,Fboats.
OL,11,F"Our instructions were basically to
OL,12,Fpatrol the English Channel and seek
OL,13,Fand destroy E-boats. Which is what we
OL,14,Fattempted to do. For this purpose we
OL,15,Fwere equipped with bombs which we
OL,16,Fdidn't normally carry but it was
OL,17,Fthought for this type of operation
OL,18,Fbombs would be more effective.

OL,6,F"The patrols were mainly done at
OL,7,Fnight. A single aircraft would fly
OL,8,Falong the Channel and it would be
OL,9,Ftracked by radar from the South coast
OL,10,Fand that radar would also search the
OL,11,FChannel for enemy E-boats and if it
OL,12,Ffound one or two it would work out the
OL,13,Fdirection for us to fly to get there.
OL,15,F"They also told us when we reached the
OL,16,Ftarget which we couldn't always tell
OL,17,Fbecause it's pitch-black down on the
OL,18,Fwater.
