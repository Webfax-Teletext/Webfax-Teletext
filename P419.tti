OL,5,FHe became involved in heavy fighting
OL,6,Fin Maltot in July, aimed at breaking
OL,7,Fthe German defensive line around Caen.
OL,9,FHe said: "That was a village which we
OL,10,Fhad to take.
OL,12,F"We went down a slope into the village
OL,13,Fand then got to the other side and the
OL,14,FGermans withdrew into a valley and we
OL,15,Fmore or less pinned them down for a
OL,16,Fwhile. Eventually we cleared it up.

OL,5,F"When we were in there the Germans had
OL,6,Fa machine gun. The platoon was
OL,7,Ftrapped. I got fed up with that and
OL,8,Fwent up round onto the other side and
OL,9,Ftook a few shots of them over the
OL,10,Fvalley and of course the machine post
OL,11,Fwe couldn't see.
OL,13,F"I covered the withdrawal of the rest
OL,14,Fof the platoon out of the valley and
OL,15,Fjoined them on the other side of the
OL,16,Fvillage.''
OL,18,F"There was tension of course. When we
OL,19,Fstopped we dug trenches big enough for
OL,20,Fone or two.

OL,5,F"One unpleasant experience I had, we
OL,6,Fwere preparing to move and I put my
OL,7,Fpack on a little fence and a salvo of
OL,8,Fmortars came, you could hear them,
OL,9,Fnine barrel mortars coming in over the
OL,10,Ftop.
OL,12,F"I dived down into the bottom of the

OL,17,Fwas at first."
