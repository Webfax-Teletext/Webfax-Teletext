OL,6,FA West Sussex strawberry company has
OL,7,Ffound a way to extended the growing
OL,8,Fseason using new technology, making
OL,9,Ffresh British-grown strawberries
OL,10,Fwidely available this Christmas.
OL,12,FThe Summer Berry Company, one of the
OL,13,FUK's leading fruit producers based
OL,14,Fnear Chichester, is now growing
OL,15,FBritish strawberries at a commercial
OL,16,Fscale all year round with the help of
OL,17,FLED technology through the colder
