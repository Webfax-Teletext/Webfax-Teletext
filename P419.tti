OL,10,FWorking at sites around Bletchley Park
OL,11,Fin Buckinghamshire, Mrs Bourne was a

OL,14,FAfter joining the Wrens she was chosen
OL,15,Fto work at the secret site set up to
OL,16,Fdecode intercepted Nazi messages.

OL,5,F"I am not really sure why it
OL,6,Fhappened," said Mrs Bourne.
OL,8,F"But we went to our training camp as
OL,9,Fnormally we all did and when we were
OL,10,Fall given categories I was put into a
OL,11,Fcategory called SDX special duties.
OL,13,F"There were maybe half a dozen of us
OL,14,Fand we said 'what's that?' And we were
OL,15,Ftold 'We don't know.' That's all we
OL,16,Fwere told."
OL,18,FThe monumental task was to decode
OL,19,Fmessages that had been encrypted via
OL,20,Fthe Enigma cypher device.

OL,5,FAccording to Bletchley Park's website:
OL,6,F"These devices typically changed
OL,7,Fsettings every 24 hours and with 159
OL,8,Fquintillion possible combinations
OL,9,Fevery day, the staff at Bletchley Park
OL,10,Fworked around the clock to break the
OL,11,Fsettings by hand."
OL,13,FThe Bombes were designed by Alan
OL,14,FTuring and were electro-mechanical
OL,15,Fmachines helping to speed up the
OL,16,Fprocess.
OL,18,FMrs Bourne said: "It had all the
OL,19,Fcomponents of an Enigma machine, the
OL,20,Fdrums, the wheels and the plugs.

OL,5,F"It was searching for the reasonable
OL,6,Fpossible answer to any of the paired
OL,7,Fletters of an Enigma machine. There
OL,8,Fwere three banks of wheels replicating
OL,9,Fthe drums on an Enigma machine...we
OL,10,Fput the drums onto rows of rods, being
OL,11,Fextremely accurate.
OL,13,F"Then we went round the back of the
OL,14,Fmachine and were plugging in pairs of
OL,15,Fletters.
OL,17,F"One of the difficulties of breaking
OL,18,FEnigma was the pairs of letters on the
OL,19,FEnigma machine that were very complex.
OL,21,F"Then we set the machine going."

OL,5,FMrs Bourne remembers only a handful of

OL,7,Fthere were more than 200.
OL,9,FThe work was so intensive that at
