OL,6,FCraig David has sold millions of
OL,7,Frecords and had global success but the
OL,8,Fsinger doesn't take any of it for
OL,9,Fgranted.
OL,11,FWhen asked if he has any regrets,
OL,12,FCraig says, "I think experience and
OL,13,Fwisdom with time allows you to look
OL,14,Fback at some of those things that were
OL,15,Ftesting and difficult for you. And you
OL,16,Frealise that actually that shaped you
OL,17,Finto who you are now."

OL,4,Cshaped him into who he is today
OL,6,FHe came home last week for a gig for
OL,7,FVinilo at the 1865 close to where he
OL,8,Fgrew up on the Holyrood estate in
OL,9,FSouthampton.
OL,11,F"I always say this when I come down
OL,12,FThe Avenue I just get the nostalgia,
OL,13,Fthat feeling of growing up here and
OL,14,Fwhat it means to me," says Craig David.
OL,16,FThe singer's ninth album 'Commitment'
OL,17,Fhas just been released.

OL,6,F"The reason I called the album
OL,7,FCommitment was because I've always
OL,8,Ffelt committed to wanting to make
OL,9,Fmusic that just touches your heart in
OL,10,Fsome way."
OL,12,FAnd Craig says he's been really
OL,13,Fpleased with the response, "If this
OL,14,Fresonates, this could be a core memory
OL,15,Ffor a 16, 17-year-old kid who just
OL,16,Fdiscovers it, or a fan who's been
OL,17,Fthere from day one."
OL,19,FCraig recently performed on stage with
OL,20,FUsher, so could a collaboration be on
OL,21,Fthe way?
