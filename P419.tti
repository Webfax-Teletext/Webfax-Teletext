OL,12,FDublin Zoo in Ireland but despite
OL,13,Fefforts by staff to teach and
OL,14,Fencourage its mother to feed the
OL,15,Fyoungster, it was decided to find a
OL,16,Fnew home for it.
OL,18,FNow the 12-week-old male has been

OL,6,FA spokeswoman for the centre said:
OL,7,F"Sibu Junior was born on July 31st and
OL,8,Fdespite his mother clearly loving him,
OL,9,Fshe did not possess the skills to
OL,10,Fposition him so he could feed, so the
OL,11,Fdifficult decision was taken to remove
OL,12,FSibu Junior to be hand reared, to save
OL,13,Fthe youngster."
OL,15,F"The team at Dublin Zoo cared for Sibu
OL,16,FJunior round the clock for the first
OL,17,Fcouple months of his life, while
