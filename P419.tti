OL,11,F"This is a matter which, of course,
OL,12,Fcontinues to be investigated by Thames
OL,13,FValley Police. It is not exactly known
OL,14,Fwhat the outcome of their
OL,15,Finvestigation will be.J"However, the
OL,16,Fdeath is clearly unnatural, and an
OL,17,Finquest may be required at a later
OL,18,Fdate.J"This inquest is opened and
