OL,10,FHayley came up with the idea for
OL,11,FT.A.Ps in 2018, after paying for a dog
OL,12,Fcalled Fern to be trained for her son,
OL,13,FMancub, who has autism.
OL,15,FThe red spaniel puppy instantly
OL,16,Fclicked with Mancub, who at the time,
OL,17,Fwas non-verbal and didn't show his
OL,18,Femotions.
