OL,6,FA woman from Kent says her family has
OL,7,Fbeen left devastated after her
OL,8,Fmother's memorial bench disappeared
OL,9,Ffrom the seafront in Sandgate.
OL,11,FIt's thought the bench was either
OL,12,Fswept out to sea, or removed by the
OL,13,Fcouncil because it was damaged when
OL,14,FFolkestone was hit by storm Goretti.
OL,16,FCara Morgan says it has left the
OL,17,Ffamily unable to leave flowers this
OL,18,Fweek to mark the 15th anniversary of
OL,19,Ftheir mother's death.
