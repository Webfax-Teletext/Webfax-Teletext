OL,6,GThere's been an unlikely addition to
OL,7,Gchannel guides this month with the
OL,8,Garrival of Sky Kids. Unlikely given the

OL,6,FSky has already lost Disney's
OL,7,Fchildren's channels. And as WBD
OL,8,Fprepares to flex its muscles when its
OL,9,Fcurrent Sky carriage expires, there's
OL,10,Fscope for other big changes to
OL,11,Fchildren's broadcasting in the coming
OL,12,Ftwo years.
OL,14,FLast autumn, Sky sold its stake in
OL,15,FNickelodeon UK, giving Paramount full
OL,16,Fcontrol of the channel and its future

OL,18,Fcleared the path for Sky to do its own

OL,6,FBy launching it on channel 609, it's
OL,7,Falso got another ace up its sleeve.
OL,9,FFor when the BBC closes CBBC, CBeebies
OL,10,Fwill almost certainly move up one slot

OL,9,Fwhat better way to gain viewers by

OL,11,FEspecially as both Sky Kids and
