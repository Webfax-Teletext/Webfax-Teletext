OL,6,GThis evening's planned 30-minute
OL,7,Gedition of Sportsday ended after
OL,8,Gfifteen minutes due to technical
OL,9,Gproblems.
OL,11,FEagle-eyed viewers may have noticed a
OL,12,Flack of BBC Sport on-screen graphics
OL,13,F(though the standard BBC News flipper
OL,14,Fwas present).
OL,16,FBut things went more noticeably awry
OL,17,Fafter a two-way with Hywel Griffith in
OL,18,FDoha, when presenter Hugh Ferris was
OL,19,Fleft reading one story after another to
OL,20,Fcamera.

OL,6,FWhen a video report failed to
OL,7,Fmaterialise, Hugh apologised: "You can
OL,8,Ftell we've been having some problems
OL,9,Fwith the pictures here at Sportsday at
OL,10,Fthe moment.
OL,12,F"So I'll just continue to tell you some
OL,13,Fof the other sports news that we've had
OL,14,Ftoday at the BBC Sports Centre."
OL,16,FEventually, the programme team through
OL,17,Fin the towel.

OL,6,FHugh told viewers: "That in the trade
OL,7,Fis called a bit of vamping. And I will
OL,8,Fend it now to put us all out of our
OL,9,Fmisery. But thank you very much indeed.
OL,11,F"All sorts of problems here with all of
OL,12,Four pictures. So that you don't have to
OL,13,Fput up with me any more, let's hand you
OL,14,Fto Matt Taylor who has got the
OL,15,Fweather."
OL,17,FAnd so at 7.45pm we had a pre-recoded
OL,18,Fweather bulletin from Matt Taylor. That
OL,19,Fwas followed by an unscheduled repeat
OL,20,Fof yesterday's edition of Newswatch.

OL,6,FJust before 8pm, Newswatch was faded
