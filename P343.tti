OL,6,GLast week we discussed the urgent need
OL,7,Gto find ways of offering more HD
OL,8,Gchannels on Freeview.
OL,10,FIf this doesn't happen, sooner or later
OL,11,Fterrestrial television will become a
OL,12,Flegacy service ` the equivalent of
OL,13,Fanalogue TV 15 years ago or 405-line
OL,14,Ftransmissions in 1980.
OL,16,FIn the past week, the situation has
OL,17,Ftaken an interesting turn. The BBC's
OL,18,Fmove to an all-HD satellite service has
OL,19,Fbeen accelerated.

OL,8,Fthe red button service will be in HD on
OL,9,FSky and Freesat.
OL,11,FIt would not be completely surprising
OL,12,Fif the SD "Nightlight" service ends up
OL,13,Fbeing switched off a little earlier

OL,6,FWhat matters is ensuring that those

OL,11,FSo will the BBC's move be copied by
OL,12,Fother broadcasters? I suspect the days
OL,13,Fof SD variants of HD channels will soon
OL,14,Fbe over.
OL,16,FITV no longer has SD versions of most

OL,10,FClosing the remaining SD streams would

OL,15,FThe +1 services, which are declining in

OL,6,FWhen the HD service was considered a
OL,7,Fpremium, there were many examples of
OL,8,Fchannels which provided an unencrypted
OL,9,FSD service and an HD service behind a
OL,10,Fpaywall ` even if this paywall was
OL,11,Fsometimes just the basic HD

OL,14,FBut is it still worth some channels
OL,15,Fpaying for both HD and SD streams? I
OL,16,Fsuspect some will have to decide
OL,17,Fbetween making their HD service

OL,6,FEither way it seems certain Freesat
