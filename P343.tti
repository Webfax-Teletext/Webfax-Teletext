OL,6,GToday's edition of the BBC News at
OL,7,GOne got off to a bad start, with a
OL,8,Gcamera issue affecting the link into
OL,9,Gthe top story.
OL,11,FThe wide shot that followed the
OL,12,Fprogramme's opening titles looked off
OL,13,Ffrom the start.
OL,15,FPresenter Ben Brown was positioned at
OL,16,Fthe tower, ready to provide the link
OL,17,Finto the lead story. He was seen
OL,18,Flooking down at his paper script,
OL,19,Fpresumably already aware that there
OL,20,Fwas a potential issue with the
OL,21,Fcameras and that his autocue could
OL,22,Fbecome unavailable to him.

OL,6,FBen's camera almost immediately began
OL,7,Fmoving in the wrong direction, taking
OL,8,Fhis autocue with it. And he did
OL,9,Findeed become dependent on his paper
OL,10,Fscript when the autocue moved too far
OL,11,Faway.
OL,13,FBen completed his link for the
OL,14,Fopening story and the accompanying
OL,15,Fvideo package was then played out
OL,16,Fnormally.
