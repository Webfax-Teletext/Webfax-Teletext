OL,6,GThe chairman of the BBC has called on
OL,7,Gthe Government to take over funding for
OL,8,Gthe BBC World Service as cuts continue
OL,9,Gto UK-focused services.
OL,11,FSpeaking yesterday, Richard Sharp
OL,12,Fwarned that the BBC would have to make
OL,13,Ffurther cuts to the World Service as
OL,14,Fpart of overall budget reductions.
OL,16,FSharp said the future of the BBC World
OL,17,FService was "in jeopardy" unless the
OL,18,Fgovernment steps in with more money.

OL,7,Fwhether it was right for "audiences in

OL,14,Findicating further cuts to UK services

OL,6,FThe BBC World Service was originally
OL,7,Ffunded through the Foreign and
OL,8,FCommonwealth Office. This changed
OL,9,Fduring the first licence fee freeze
OL,10,Fthat ran from 2011 to 2016, when the
OL,11,FBBC was asked to shoulder the cost of
OL,12,FS4C, the World Service and the rollout
