OL,5,GThis evening's planned 30-minute
OL,6,Gedition of Sportsday ended after
OL,7,Gfifteen minutes due to technical
OL,8,Gproblems.
OL,10,FEagle-eyed viewers may have noticed a
OL,11,Flack of BBC Sport on-screen graphics
OL,12,F(though the standard BBC News flipper
OL,13,Fwas present).
OL,15,FBut things went more noticeably awry
OL,16,Fafter a two-way with Hywel Griffith in
OL,17,FDoha, when presenter Hugh Ferris was
OL,18,Fleft reading one story after another to
OL,19,Fcamera.

OL,5,FWhen a video report failed to
OL,6,Fmaterialise, Hugh apologised: "You can
OL,7,Ftell we've been having some problems
OL,8,Fwith the pictures here at Sportsday at
OL,9,Fthe moment.
OL,11,F"So I'll just continue to tell you some
OL,12,Fof the other sports news that we've had
OL,13,Ftoday at the BBC Sports Centre."
OL,15,FEventually, the programme team through
OL,16,Fin the towel.
OL,18,FHugh told viewers: "That in the trade
OL,19,Fis called a bit of vamping. And I will
OL,20,Fend it now to put us all out of our
OL,21,Fmisery. But thank you very much indeed.

OL,5,F"All sorts of problems here with all of
OL,6,Four pictures. So that you don't have to
OL,7,Fput up with me any more, let's hand you
OL,8,Fto Matt Taylor who has got the
OL,9,Fweather."
OL,11,FAnd so at 7.45pm we had a pre-recoded
OL,12,Fweather bulletin from Matt Taylor. That
OL,13,Fwas followed by an unscheduled repeat
OL,14,Fof yesterday's edition of Newswatch.
OL,16,FJust before 8pm, Newswatch was faded
OL,17,Fout, as we moved into a brief countdown
OL,18,Fsequence taking us up to the top of the
OL,19,Fhour, when live news programming
OL,20,Fresumed.
