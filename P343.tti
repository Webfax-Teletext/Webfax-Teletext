OL,6,FTV schedules are now back to normal   
OL,7,Ffollowing the period of mourning which
OL,8,Ffollowed the death of HM The Queen. But
OL,9,Fthere will be a legacy which is likely
OL,10,Fto be felt for several days.          
OL,12,FThe main commercial channels suspended
OL,13,Fall advertising in the immediate      
OL,14,Faftermath of The Queen's death.       
OL,16,FThrough the period of mourning, there 
OL,17,Fwas no advertising around programmes  
OL,18,Fconcerning Her Majesty's death or the 
OL,19,Ffuneral. Indeed advertising is        
OL,20,Fspecifically forbidden during formal

OL,6,FHowever this means that more          
OL,7,Fadvertising than normal is now being  
OL,8,Fshown.                                
OL,10,FThe Code on the Scheduling of         
OL,11,FTelevision Advertisements allows for  
OL,12,Fthe transfer of lost advertising time 
OL,13,Fin certain circumstances. This is just
OL,14,Fsuch a situation.                     
OL,16,FThe broadcasters will have approached 
OL,17,FOfcom with a request to do this.      
OL,19,FThe temporary increase in advertising 
OL,20,Fis particularly noticeable on ITV.

OL,6,FFor instance there is now a full 12

OL,8,Fand an extra 4 minute break just before
OL,9,Fthe ITV Evening News at 6.30pm.       
OL,11,FThe break before 9pm has also been    
OL,12,Freconfigured  generally 90 seconds of

OL,14,F90 seconds afterwards. Before, the

OL,18,FThis is being done, it seems, to allow

OL,6,FThe main reason for moving things round
OL,7,Fso much is to ensure that no clock hour
OL,8,Fcontains more than 12 minutes of      
OL,9,Fadverts.                              
OL,11,FWhile this is only temporary, it comes
OL,12,Fas Ofcom considers whether to allow   
OL,13,FITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 to run as
OL,14,Fmany adverts as other channels.       
OL,16,FIf there if no adverse public reaction,

OL,6,FThe decision is not a given  there is
OL,7,Fa risk that an increase in advertising
OL,8,Ftime could drive down prices so be of 
OL,9,Fno benefit to broadcasters or viewers.
OL,10,FThat will need proper examination.    
OL,12,FIt doesn't go without saying that a   
OL,13,Fpermanent increase would be handled in
OL,14,Fthe same way on air. Programme        
OL,15,Fdurations may need to be slightly
