OL,6,GLast week I pondered over whether BBC
OL,7,GOne news programmes should still be
OL,8,Gcurtailed between Christmas and New
OL,9,GYear.
OL,11,FIn recent years there has been a
OL,12,Fgradual trend towards a more normal
OL,13,Fnews schedule over the festive period
OL,14,Fand on Bank Holidays.
OL,16,FBut the duration of bulletins is still
OL,17,Fshorter than normal and the timing is
OL,18,Fnot set in stone.

OL,6,FI would contend that the evidence of

OL,11,FNow, of course, there are important
OL,12,Fissues to contend with.
OL,14,FFirst and foremost, the period might be
OL,15,Fquieter than usual: Parliament and the
OL,16,Fcourts are not sitting. But news is
OL,17,Fabout so much more than this.

OL,6,FOn Tuesday, the curtailed BBC News at
OL,7,FOne led on a series of missile strikes
OL,8,Facross Ukraine. There was a good
OL,9,Fpackage from Ukraine but no two-way
OL,10,Fwith a correspondent to help assess the
OL,11,Fsignificance of the attacks.
OL,13,FPresumably this was a timing decision
OL,14,Fand not about resourcing or the
OL,15,Favailability of reporters and
OL,16,Fcorrespondents.
OL,18,FIndeed there has been no shortage of
OL,19,Fother important news over the holiday

OL,21,Fsevere weather in North America.

OL,6,FWithout giving away confidential
OL,7,Finformation, it is reasonable to
OL,8,Fsuppose a rota is worked out for news

OL,10,Fthe office ready for deployment, some
OL,11,Fcorrespondents will have been at work
OL,12,For on standby in case there was a story
OL,13,Fin their field of expertise.
OL,15,FIn short, BBC News could almost
OL,16,Fcertainly have provided normal
OL,17,Fbulletins of the normal duration and
OL,18,Fquality at no significant extra cost.

OL,6,FOf course, there would also have been

OL,6,FWell the ratings for the curtailed

OL,6,FThe solution though is simple.
OL,7,FOccasionally on a Sunday or Bank
OL,8,FHoliday, it should be considered
OL,9,Fperfectly acceptable to delay the Ten
OL,10,Ffor an exceptional programme such as a
