OL,3,CPet cat blinded in air gun attack
OL,5,FA pet cat has been blinded after being
OL,6,Fshot in the face with an air gun.
OL,8,FRocket, who is 10 months old, was shot
OL,9,Fin the Hartington Avenue area of
OL,10,FCarlton in Nottingham.
OL,12,FThe pellet lodged in the tabby's brain
OL,13,Fand vets have said it cannot be
OL,14,Fremoved. It means that although Rocket
OL,15,Fis still alive now his owners are
OL,16,Funsure how long he will live.
OL,18,FThe attack meant the cat's jaw was
OL,19,Falso shattered and broken in addition
OL,20,Fto his right eye needing to be removed
OL,21,Fby a vet.

OL,5,FRocket's owner Emma Gordon said: "I
OL,6,Fwas devastated when I found out. The
OL,7,Fvet thought it was a thorn that had
OL,8,Fcaused the damage. But they spotted
OL,9,Fthe path of an air rifle pellet at the
OL,10,Fback of his eye socket. At first, we
OL,11,Fwere shocked and in disbelief. But now
OL,12,Fwe're just angry.
OL,14,F"We're worried about Rocket's future.
OL,15,FHis well-being is very uncertain.
OL,16,FWe're also very concerned that there's
OL,17,Fsomeone out there deliberately
OL,18,Ftargeting animals and we really don't
OL,19,Fwant any other animal or owner to go
OL,20,Fthrough this terrible trauma."

OL,5,F"Cats and wildlife are the animals
OL,6,Fmost susceptible to being shot simply
OL,7,Fbecause they are out in the open with
