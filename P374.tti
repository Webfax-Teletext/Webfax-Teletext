OL,15,FHe did exactly what he was brought in

OL,4,Cmanager Enzo Maresca leaves for Chelsea
OL,6,FMaresca joined Leicester last summer
OL,7,Ffrom Manchester City - where he had
OL,8,Fworked with Pep Guardiola. His team,
OL,9,Fparticularly at home, dominated
OL,10,Fpossession.
OL,12,FFor a small minority it was TOO
OL,13,Fpatient, at times boring, and they
OL,14,Fmight be happy. Others enjoyed it but
OL,15,Fwould fear how that style would be
OL,16,Freplicated in the Premier League. It
OL,17,Fcertainly didn't work for Burnley.

OL,6,FWith that in mind, it is difficult to

OL,8,Fmost expensive squad in the

OL,11,FBut Chelsea players and fans can also

OL,11,FLeicester now have to find someone
