OL,6,FDuring the trial of Cody Fisher's
OL,7,Fkillers, it emerged that the story
OL,8,Fstarted two days before Boxing Day,
OL,9,Fwith a chance encounter on Christmas
OL,10,FEve at Popworld in between Cody Fisher
OL,11,Fand Remy Gordon.
OL,13,FIt was a busy dancefloor, and the
OL,14,Fcramped conditions meant Cody had
OL,15,Fbrushed past the back of Gordon while
OL,16,Fleaving the club.
OL,18,FGordon confronted Cody about having
OL,19,Fbeen pushed, but the encounter ended
OL,20,Fwithout violence as Cody and Dan left
OL,21,Fthe club for a lift home with Jess.

OL,6,FThe prosecution told the court this
OL,7,Fwas a tragically accurate prediction
OL,8,Fof events to come, and concluded that
OL,9,FCody's murder two days later "was not
OL,10,Fa flash of temper, but a planned act
OL,11,Fof retribution."
OL,13,FDetective Inspector Michelle Thurgood,
OL,14,Fof , said:
OL,16,F"It is shocking to me that Remy Gordon
OL,17,Fwas so affronted by such a small

OL,20,Fno more than knocked into him."
