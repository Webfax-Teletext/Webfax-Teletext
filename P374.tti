OL,7,FA video has sparked anger on social
OL,8,Fmedia after a dog off the lead was
OL,9,Fallowed to chase a herd of deer across
OL,10,Fa park in Leicestershire.
OL,12,FBradgate Park is famous for its deer,
OL,13,Fwith animals living in the wild there
OL,14,Ffor hundreds of years. There are
OL,15,Fcurrently around 450 in the park.
OL,17,FBut over the weekend (26 April), a
OL,18,Fvideo shared on Facebook showed dozens
OL,19,Fwere scattered in all directions by a
OL,20,Fblack dog that had been let off the
OL,21,Flead by a man.

OL,7,FTerry Murray, a volunteer at Bradgate

OL,9,F"We've got signs everywhere to say
OL,10,Fkeep your dogs on a lead.
OL,12,F"They (the deer) were frightened and
OL,13,Fwere going everywhere, dispersing in
OL,14,Ftwo different groups, one going one
OL,15,Fway and one going another way."
OL,17,FHe added, "I think it's disgusting.
OL,18,FThere's no control whatsoever."
OL,20,FWhen the video was posted online,
OL,21,Fthose viewing reacted angrily.
