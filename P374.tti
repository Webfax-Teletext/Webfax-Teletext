OL,6,FA JCB spokesman said: "The World
OL,7,FLogistics facility was commissioned in
OL,8,F2014 as the company's main central
OL,9,Flogistics hub. Since then, the number
OL,10,Fof machines manufactured by JCB has
OL,11,Falmost doubled and the facility has
OL,12,Fbeen at full capacity for the past
OL,13,Ffive years. Today it can only store
OL,14,F50% of JCB inbound container freight
OL,15,Fprior to distribution to the company's
OL,16,FUK factories. This has forced JCB to
OL,17,Fintroduce multiple locations for parts
OL,18,Fstorage, which is not sustainable in
OL,19,Fthe long term.

OL,7,Fessential and a decision has been made
OL,8,Fto exit the JCB World Logistics
