OL,6,FThe proposed bill would permit people
OL,7,Fwith less than six months to live to
OL,8,Fhave an assisted death. They'd have to
OL,9,Fdeclare twice that they wanted to die
OL,10,F- showing full mental capacity.
OL,12,FAnd they'd need sign-off from two
OL,13,Findependent doctors, with a decision
OL,14,Falso sent to a high court judge for
OL,15,Ffinal approval.
OL,17,FThe bill also makes it illegal to
OL,18,Fpressure anyone into dying. MPs will
OL,19,Fvote on the bill tomorrow, 29th
OL,20,FNovember.
