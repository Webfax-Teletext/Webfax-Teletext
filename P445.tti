OL,4,C'rollercoaster' of becoming Taoiseach
OL,6,FSimon Harris has said becoming
OL,7,FTaoiseach has been "quite a
OL,8,Frollercoaster".
OL,10,FIn his first broadcast interview since
OL,11,Ftaking up the top role at Government,
OL,12,FMr Harris also said that the recent
OL,13,FCabinet reshuffle was "challenging".
OL,15,FAsked about becoming Taoiseach, he
OL,16,Fsaid: "It's been a little bit surreal.
OL,17,FLook, it's a great honour, it's
OL,18,Fsomething that I find very humbling.

OL,7,Fonly 16 people in Ireland to have the
OL,8,Fhonour to have been the Taoiseach of
OL,9,Fthis great country and that means a
