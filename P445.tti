OL,5,FThe Police Service of Northern Ireland
OL,6,Fhas been fined #750,000 for an
OL,7,F"egregious" data breach in which the
OL,8,Fpersonal information of staff and
OL,9,Fofficers was released.
OL,11,FThe Information Commissioner's Office
OL,12,F(ICO) fined the organisation for the
OL,13,F"serious" breach that left many PSNI
OL,14,Fworkers fearing for their safety and
OL,15,Fsaid "simple-to-implement" procedures
OL,16,Fcould have prevented it.

OL,8,Fleak, some officers chose to relocate

OL,12,FThe UK data regulator said that the

OL,14,Fbut as it was "mindful" of the
OL,15,Ffinancial constraints faced by the

OL,5,FThe ICO investigation found that the

OL,7,FPSNI staff and officers, with some
OL,8,Fstating that they had left the

OL,12,FUK Information Commissioner John
OL,13,FEdwards said it was "a lack of simple,
OL,14,Finternal processes" that led to the
OL,15,F"particularly egregious breach."
