OL,6,FFormer UUP leader Dr Steve Aiken has
OL,7,Fbeen recommended for exclusion from
OL,8,FAssembly proceedings for two sitting
OL,9,Fdays over an "egregious breach" of the
OL,10,Fmembers' code of conduct.
OL,12,FThe Committee for Standards and
OL,13,FPrivileges has tabled a motion in the
OL,14,FAssembly with the recommendation.
OL,16,FIt follows a complaint from Sinn Fein
OL,17,FMLA Maoliosa McHugh about comments
OL,18,Fmade by Dr Aiken during a live-
OL,19,Fstreamed meeting of the Finance
OL,20,FCommittee.

OL,4,Csanction against Steve Aiken
OL,6,FIt centred around claims that Dr Aiken
OL,7,Fhad raised a complaint that he had
OL,8,Fmade about Mr McHugh, alleging the
OL,9,FSinn Fein politician or his office had
OL,10,Fnot made a declaration of interest

OL,17,FMr McHugh said that Dr Aiken's
OL,18,Fdisclosure of both the fact and the
OL,19,Fcontents of the complaint were in
OL,20,Fbreach of members' rules.
