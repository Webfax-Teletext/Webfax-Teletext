OL,6,FUnpaid carers in Northern Ireland are
OL,7,Ffacing a multi-million pound bill due
OL,8,Fto benefit overpayments which "will
OL,9,Fpush many into acute financial
OL,10,Fhardship".
OL,12,FNewly obtained data shows that between
OL,13,F2021 and 2024, there were around 6,500
OL,14,Fcarers allowance overpayment breaches
OL,15,Freferred to the Department for

OL,17,Ftotal value of #9,208,923.
OL,19,FMany carers have experienced similar
