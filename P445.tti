OL,6,FThe 49-year-old avoided a statutory

OL,14,FHowever, there was criticism by

OL,17,Fthe sentence had been too lenient.

OL,6,F"While sentencing is a matter for the

OL,8,FPublic Prosecutions does have the
OL,9,Fpower to refer particular sentences to
OL,10,Fthe Court of Appeal on the grounds
OL,11,Fthat they may be unduly lenient," a
OL,12,FPPS spokesperson said.
OL,14,F"An unduly lenient sentence is one
OL,15,Fthat falls outside the range of
OL,16,Fsentences that a judge, taking into
OL,17,Fconsideration all relevant factors and
OL,18,Fhaving regard to sentencing guidance,
OL,19,Fcould reasonably impose. The sentence
OL,20,Fmust not just be lenient but unduly
OL,21,Flenient.
