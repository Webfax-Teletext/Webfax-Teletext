OL,6,FAsked about the Assembly report in
OL,7,FBelfast on Wednesday, Mr Murphy said:
OL,8,F"The report only landed yesterday,
OL,9,Fit's something like 40 pages. I know
OL,10,Fthere has been an initial response
OL,11,Ffrom the party.
OL,13,F"In relation to all of those matters,
OL,14,Fwe have initiated our own internal
OL,15,Freview of that. That is coming to a
OL,16,Fconclusion very soon. But the report
OL,17,Ffrom the Assembly now goes to the
OL,18,Fpolice and they have to make their
OL,19,Fassessment of it, and I think we
OL,20,Fshould give them space to do that."
