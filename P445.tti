OL,6,FEighty years ago today, the course of
OL,7,Fthe Second World War changed thanks to
OL,8,Fthe amazing bravery, fortitude and
OL,9,Fsacrifice of the many thousands who
OL,10,Ftook part in the D-Day landings along
OL,11,Fthe north coast of France.
OL,13,FVeterans from D-Day gathered in
OL,14,FNormandy earlier along with the King
OL,15,Fand Queen, President Macron and other
OL,16,Fdignitaries to mark the historic event.
OL,18,FDeputy First Minister Emma Little
OL,19,FPengelly said it was important to
OL,20,Frecognise those from Northern Ireland
OL,21,Fwho 'stepped up' on D-Day.

OL,6,F"I think it's incredibly important
OL,7,Fthat we remember their sacrifice. Over

OL,9,Fthe Royal Ulster Rifles lost over 400

OL,12,Fnot least because, of course, in
