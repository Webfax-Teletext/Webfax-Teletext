OL,7,FA Stormont spending watchdog has
OL,8,Fwarned that the Executive faces a
OL,9,F"cliff edge" when money from a
OL,10,FGovernment support package runs out.
OL,12,FThe Northern Ireland Fiscal Council
OL,13,Fsaid the #3.3 billion settlement
OL,14,Fprovided a substantial cash injection
OL,15,Fto deal with immediate pressures
OL,16,Ffacing public services in the region.
OL,18,FBut it questioned whether the package
OL,19,Foffered a realistic route to long-term
OL,20,Ffinancial sustainability at Stormont.

OL,10,FIreland, has conducted an assessment
OL,11,Fof the Treasury-funded settlement.
