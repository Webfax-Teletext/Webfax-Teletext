OL,6,FThe mussels species are filter feeders
OL,7,Fthat remove almost all phytoplankton,
OL,8,Fwhich is the bottom layer of the food

OL,16,Fsuffocate native freshwater mussels.
OL,18,FThey can also block water pipes, which

OL,8,Fsaid the quagga mussel is a small

OL,12,FThe species has spread rapidly from

OL,15,FEurope and to North America and Mexico.
OL,17,FIt was first recorded in Britain in
