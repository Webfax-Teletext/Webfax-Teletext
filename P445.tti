OL,6,FThe head of the Ambulance Service, Dr

OL,8,Fseriously ill patients are being asked
OL,9,Fto make their own way to A&E.
OL,11,F"Sometimes the risk of waiting what is
OL,12,Fgoing to be a significant period for

OL,14,Fputting somebody in a car and

OL,16,Ftold UTV.

OL,6,F"We do know there's lots of evidence
