OL,7,Ffound police failed to protect a
OL,8,Fmurder victim in the months running up
OL,9,Fto his killing.
OL,11,FThe investigation found the PSNI
OL,12,Fmissed opportunities to identify the
OL,13,Fsubject of a dissident republican
OL,14,Fthreat, six months before the 2018
OL,15,Fmurder of Jim Donegan.JJim Donegan was
OL,16,Fgunned down by a lone gunman while
OL,17,Fwaiting to collect his son outside a
OL,18,Fschool on the Glen Road in west
OL,19,FBelfast on 4 December.

OL,9,FAlthough it did not identity him.
OL,11,FThere had been other threats made

OL,6,FThe Ombudsman found on 7 June in 2018
OL,7,Fpolice received intelligence that
OL,8,Fdissident republicans were planning to
OL,9,Fshoot an unnamed man "they believed to
OL,10,Fbe involved in the sale of illegal
OL,11,Fdrugs".JThe intelligence identified
OL,12,Fthe type of car driven by the man and
OL,13,Fstated that he regularly picked up his
OL,14,Fson from a school on the Glen Road,
OL,15,Fbut provided no date for the
OL,16,Fanticipated attack.JAlthough police
OL,17,Fhad faced challenges in identifying Mr
OL,18,FDonegan as the subject of the threat,
OL,19,Fthe Ombudsman found that additional
OL,20,Fresearch of the police computer system
OL,21,Fat an early stage would have been
OL,22,Flikely to have made such a link.J"As
OL,23,Fthat did not happen, no threat
