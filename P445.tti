OL,10,FSome of the older graves are showing
OL,11,Ftheir age, youth groups are attempting
OL,12,Fto renew this important record of

OL,6,F"(The young people) not only come to
OL,7,Fvalue the site but they maybe begin to
OL,8,Fhave a curiosity for the history of
OL,9,FBelfast," the Local Historian said.
OL,11,FHe explained to UTV that what appears
OL,12,Fto be a path through the cemetery is
OL,13,Factually the length of an underground
OL,14,Fdividing wall.
OL,16,F"It was meant to keep the catholic
OL,17,Fworms from meeting the protestant
OL,18,Fworms," he joked.

OL,6,FIn the past, the site was regarded as
OL,7,Fa predominantly Protestant cemetery in
OL,8,Fan overwhelmingly Catholic
OL,9,Fneighborhood. That negative perception
OL,10,Fwas cemented by the Troubles.
OL,12,FRecalling a conversation with a local
OL,13,Fbusiness man Father Martin Magill
OL,14,Fsaid: "He mentioned when British

OL,16,Fearly 1970s, that in particular really
OL,17,Fput people off.
OL,19,F"There has been a fear from the
OL,20,FTroubles onwards that has kept some
OL,21,Fpeople from the Protestant community."

OL,15,F"I had an elderly aunt who tragically
