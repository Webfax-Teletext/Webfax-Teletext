OL,7,FAt the beginning of the hearing, Ms
OL,8,FO'Neill denied "absolutley," "playing
OL,9,Fpolitics" during the pandemic.JAsked
OL,10,Fif she felt she gave good leadership
OL,11,Fto Northern Ireland with then First
OL,12,FMinister Arlene Foster during the
OL,13,Fpandemic, Ms O'Neill said she did.JMs
OL,14,FO'Neill was shown a tense WhatsApp
OL,15,Fmessage exchange with Baroness Foster
OL,16,Fdated March 21 2020.JBaroness Foster
OL,17,Ftells Ms O'Neill in the exchange that
OL,18,Fshe felt her "public undermining of
OL,19,FRobin (Swann) was totally uncalled
OL,20,Ffor".J"If you want to effect change in
OL,21,Fa policy you are going completely the
OL,22,Fwrong way about it. You are playing
OL,23,Fpolitics when things are much too
OL,24,Fserious.J"It is hugely disappointing
OL,25,Fbut unfortunately I'm not surprised."

OL,8,F"It's too serious to tolerate. Lives
OL,9,Fwill be lost. Start listening."
OL,10,FBaroness Foster went on to query
OL,11,Fwhether Ms O'Neill was "calling two of
OL,12,Fyour ministerial colleagues
OL,13,Fincompetent", adding "Naomi (Long) and

OL,16,Furged her to be "more collegiate".JMs
OL,17,FO'Neill responded: "The department is

OL,20,Fis a time to knock head and to get

OL,14,FGovernment was too reliant on the

OL,16,Fto lead the response to the

OL,20,Fand the Department of Health were "all
