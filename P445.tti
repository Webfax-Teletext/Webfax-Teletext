OL,6,FOne of the things I have learned in
OL,7,Fthe short time that I've been talking
OL,8,Fto people for UTV's podcast 'Going the
OL,9,FExtra Mile', is the importance of
OL,10,Flived experience.
OL,12,FIt has turned into such a cliched term
OL,13,Fin many respects but for most of the
OL,14,Fpeople I've spoken to, it is their own
OL,15,Fpast experience, something which they
OL,16,Fhave gone through, something that they
OL,17,Fhave survived that gives them their
OL,18,Fpassion, their motivation and the
OL,19,Fdesire to help others.

OL,6,F"Never did I think I would end up an
OL,7,Faddict. I crossed the line. I hadn't

OL,10,Fchildren. I realised there was a
OL,11,Fproblem. Alcohol is what I was
OL,12,Faddicted to. It got to the stage where

OL,15,FThe effects of addiction are
