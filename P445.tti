OL,5,FThe inquiry only opened on Monday at

OL,10,F"transboundary issues" breaching their
OL,11,Fown planning regulations.
OL,13,FThe Planning Appeals Commissioner

OL,15,F"deeply regrettable that members of
OL,16,Fthe PAC have been put in this position

OL,5,FMs McParland added the inquiry has
OL,6,Fbeen "besieged with difficulties" and
OL,7,Fthis was a "necessary juncture". The
OL,8,Fcost to the public purse and impact on

OL,11,FCampaigners against the mine claim the
OL,12,Fgoldmine would have an environmental

OL,15,FSome residents from the county told

OL,17,Frespond to it and the public
OL,18,Fconsultation process wasn't "fair".
OL,20,FDuring a tense debate there were calls
