OL,6,FA family-run dog park near Moira is

OL,6,FNow, the Planning Appeals Commission
OL,7,F(PAC) has upheld previous concerns
OL,8,Fsurrounding noise coming from the
OL,9,Fpark, putting the future of the
OL,10,Fbusiness in jeopardy.
OL,12,F"We limit the dogs to six, we limit
OL,13,Four cars coming to four, we limit our
OL,14,Fhours - we can't really do much more,"
OL,15,FEileen told UTV.
OL,17,FIn a report, the PAC said that
OL,18,F'talking and laughing' from dog
OL,19,Fwalkers could create more noise when
OL,20,Fthey 'take breaks from using the park'.

OL,6,FThe commissioner also said that they
OL,7,Fcould hear 'some intermittent barking'
OL,8,Fcoming from the park when they paid a

OL,11,FThe owners believe that objections
OL,12,Ffrom two neighbours have led to the
OL,13,Fdecision being made, despite a
OL,14,Fpetition of more than 3,000 signatures
