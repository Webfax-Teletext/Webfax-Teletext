OL,5,F"Last year, in 2024, we made around
OL,6,F100,000 speeding detections across
OL,7,FNorthern Ireland.
OL,9,F"That is a shocking number of people,
OL,10,Fwho for whatever reason they think is
OL,11,Fjustified, found themselves with a
OL,12,Ffine and penalty points, or even under
OL,13,Farrest and in court.
OL,15,F"Even more shockingly, a number of
OL,16,Fdrivers have been caught speeding on
OL,17,Fmultiple occasions. Clearly these
OL,18,Fdrivers are not getting the message."
OL,20,FMr Donaldson urged drivers to slow
OL,21,Fdown over the Easter holiday period.
