OL,6,FMrs Erskine said: "A few weeks ago
OL,7,Fcracks were found in MaHa MOT testing
OL,8,Flifts and yet nothing has come from
OL,9,Fthe Department until now when whistle-
OL,10,Fblowers provided I and my colleagues
OL,11,Fwith information.
OL,13,F"This raises serious questions for the
OL,14,FMinister, his Department and DVA (who
OL,15,Fwill be coming to the Infrastructure
OL,16,Fcommittee on Wednesday).
OL,18,F"The Department spent #1.8million to
OL,19,Freplace 52 of the 55 lifts when cracks
OL,20,Fappeared on the same lifts in 2019.
