OL,10,Fstigma surrounding disabilities
OL,11,Fdespite an estimated one in four

OL,15,FMatthew Sheppard, who's daughter
OL,16,FJoniece, has cerebral palsy says:
OL,17,F"Barriers often stem from attitudinal
OL,18,Fand systemic issues, such as
OL,19,Fstereotypes, discrimination and
OL,20,Fpolicies that fail to account for the
