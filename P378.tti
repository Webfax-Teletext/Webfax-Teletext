OL,11,FThat is why I think it is so important

OL,6,FIn December he posted "Villa v Celtic
OL,7,Fis the fixture of my dreams. Never
OL,8,Fthought I'd see the day. As it
OL,9,Fhappens, it will be taking place on my
OL,10,Fthird day of a course of chemotherapy.
OL,11,FNo idea how I'll be feeling, but
OL,12,Fdetermined to be there. Throwing that
OL,13,Fwish into the universe for good vibes."
OL,15,FHe's continued to go to matches as the
OL,16,Frounds of chemotherapy ravaged his
OL,17,Fenergy. The West Ham game in the FA
OL,18,FCup two weeks ago was the first one he
OL,19,Fmissed because of his health.
