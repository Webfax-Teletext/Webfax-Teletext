OL,6,F"Since this investigation launched,
OL,7,Fwe've been working hard to locate the
OL,8,Fcar, any possible occupants and
OL,9,Festablish what exactly has led to the
OL,10,Fvehicle going into the water.
OL,12,F"Unfortunately, the river is running

OL,14,Famounts of rainfall we've had

OL,20,Fthat people do not speculate on what
OL,21,Fhas happened."
