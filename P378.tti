OL,6,FThe Major Oak in Sherwood Forest is
OL,7,Fone of Britain's most famous trees,
OL,8,Fbut it is now at risk of dying.
OL,10,FThe tree is thought to be 1,000 years
OL,11,Fold and, legend has it, was once a
OL,12,Fhideout for Nottinghamshire's, and
OL,13,Findeed England's, most famous outlaw,
OL,14,FRobin Hood, and his merry men.
OL,16,FIt is one of the biggest oak trees in
OL,17,FBritain, with a canopy spread of 28
OL,18,Fmetres and a trunk measuring 11 metres

OL,6,FDespite centuries of solid survival in

OL,14,FA victim of its own success
OL,16,FThe Major Oak is suffering from its
