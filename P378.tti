OL,8,Fsaid: "Me and my daughter were cutting
OL,9,Fthe grass in the garden. My daughter,
OL,10,Fwho is four, ran through the house and
OL,11,Fwithin two seconds the dog bolted
OL,12,Fbecause of the sound of the lawnmower
OL,13,Fand me and my daughter ran after her."
OL,15,F"Skye escaped from my house and we
OL,16,Fchased her down the road. We spent all
OL,17,Fevening looking in fields, we didn't
OL,18,Fsee the dog being taken, we were under
OL,19,Fthe impression that she was missing,
OL,20,Fthen a witness came forward and said
OL,21,Fthey saw somebody chase her".
