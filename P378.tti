OL,6,FScout Georgia Hinton, who was one of

OL,8,F"It's very cool and we think there's
OL,9,Fsomething else here like a stone, that
OL,10,Fmight be attached to the house."
OL,12,FThey found it on 21st July and sent it
OL,13,Fto the British Museum in London who
OL,14,Fexamined it and confirmed it is a
OL,15,Fcopper alloy, square-headed brooch,

OL,11,Flatching on the back seems to be quite
OL,12,Fmodern so we're kind of thrown a

OL,15,F"Maybe it's a replica of an Anglo-
OL,16,FSaxon brooch or, maybe just maybe we
OL,17,Ffound something quite special."
