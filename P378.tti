OL,6,FThe leader of Birmingham City Council
OL,7,Fhas claimed the authority is no longer
OL,8,Fbankrupt.
OL,10,FIt comes almost two and a half years
OL,11,Fafter the council issued a Section 114
OL,12,FNotice declaring effective bankruptcy.
OL,14,FNow the authority says it has closed a
OL,15,Fthree-hundred million pound budget
OL,16,Fgap, but says it still needs to find
OL,17,F93 million pounds of cuts in the next
OL,18,Fbudget.
OL,20,FHow does the council plan to fund the
