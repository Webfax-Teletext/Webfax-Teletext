OL,10,Fdefining day in their lives.
OL,12,FThat's the day they are going to hear
OL,13,Fthe findings from Sir Brian
OL,14,FLangstaff's far-reaching review into
OL,15,Fhow thousands of people in the UK were
OL,16,Fgiven infected blood products.
OL,18,FMany of them, like Ros Cooper who I
OL,19,Fmet at her mother Juliet's home in ,
OL,20,Fhave been campaigning for the truth

OL,11,FDoing that, Ros says, is like another

OL,14,Fwas then in my body until I had
