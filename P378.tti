OL,10,FJohn Plimmer, a 27-year-old detective
OL,11,Fconstable was at The Tavern in the
OL,12,FTown pub.
OL,14,FHe was having a quick pint with his
OL,15,Fcolleague Mike Davey as they chatted
OL,16,Fabout work.
OL,18,FJohn suggested if they stay for
OL,19,Fanother half a pint. But Mike said
OL,20,Fthey had too much work on at the
OL,21,Fstation and it wasn't a good idea.
