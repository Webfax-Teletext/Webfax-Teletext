OL,12,FThere'll be many Rams fans who'll be
OL,13,Fglad that Colin Todd is back in the
OL,14,Farea. He may be from the North East,
OL,15,Fbut in these parts, he's very much
OL,16,Ftreated like a son of Derby and for
OL,17,Fvery good reason.
OL,19,FHe played 371 times for the club and
OL,20,Fwon two league Championships, and his
OL,21,Ffondness for the club is still there.

OL,9,Fhim after Smith resigned, but the

OL,14,FDerby would be relegated from the
