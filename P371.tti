OL,6,FAt an inquest into her death, being
OL,7,Fheld at Birmingham Coroner's Court, a
OL,8,Fnumber of doctors gave evidence and
OL,9,Fdetails were read out from a Maternity
OL,10,Fand Newborn Safety Investigations
OL,11,F(MNSI) report.
OL,13,FThey showed that although Sade had
OL,14,Fbeen identified as at high risk of
OL,15,Fgestational diabetes, which is usually
OL,16,Ftested for at 26 weeks, glucose was
OL,17,Fspotted in her urine before, an
OL,18,Findicator of the disease. However,
OL,19,Ftests which would have diagnosed
OL,20,Fdiabetes were missed and she was
OL,21,Ftherefore not treated for it.

OL,8,Fwas given a paper form to take to the
