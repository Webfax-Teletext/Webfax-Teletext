OL,6,FThe first "car-free zone" school
OL,7,Fstreet has opened in Derbyshire this
OL,8,Fweek, after months of campaigning.
OL,10,FThe William Gilbert school in Duffield
OL,11,Fwill have a "school street" whereby
OL,12,Fthe area outside the school is
OL,13,Frestricted for access by cars during
OL,14,Fdrop off and pick up times.
OL,16,FThis means cars can't access Vicarage
OL,17,FLane, the road which runs alongside
OL,18,Fthe school, between the period of
OL,19,Fschool drop off and pick up times on
OL,20,FMonday to Friday.
