OL,4,CCalocane to be sentenced
OL,6,FOn Wednesday, Calocane's barrister
OL,7,FPeter Joyce KC urged the judge not to
OL,8,Fconsider a whole-life order, saying
OL,9,Fparanoid schizophrenia is an "unwanted
OL,10,Fvisitor" which "stalked down" a man of
OL,11,Fpreviously impeccable character and
OL,12,Fbehaviour.
OL,14,FMr Joyce told the court: "There are
OL,15,Fvery few whole-life orders and they
OL,16,Fhave all, without exception, been for
OL,17,Foffences of murder.
OL,19,F"This man is not before you for
OL,20,Fmurder, he is before you for
OL,21,Fmanslaughter."
