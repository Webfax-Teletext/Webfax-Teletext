OL,6,FAll Things Wild's Animal Manager,
OL,7,FMatthew Parker, said: "Dik-Diks are
OL,8,Fvery shy and timid animals.
OL,10,F"They are also incredibly unusual,
OL,11,Fwith a prehensile proboscis which
OL,12,Freminds some people of an elephant's
OL,13,Ftrunk.
OL,15,F"Although many populations of Dik-Dik
OL,16,Fantelope remain in good numbers across
OL,17,Flarge parts of Africa, there is
OL,18,Femerging evidence to suggest that some
OL,19,Flocalised populations are dwindling
OL,20,Fdue to common issues such as habitat
OL,21,Floss and poaching for illegal markets."
