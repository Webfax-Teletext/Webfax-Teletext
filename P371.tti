OL,5,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,6,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,7,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,8,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,9,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,10,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.
OL,12,FThe immune system normally defends the
OL,13,Fbody against harmful invaders, such as
OL,14,Fviruses and bacteria, to ward off
OL,15,Fillnesses.

OL,5,FPollen counts tend to be higher in the
OL,6,Fearly morning and late evening,
OL,7,Falthough they can sometimes be high
OL,8,Fall day long.
OL,10,FIf the grass is damp, the pollen peak
OL,11,Fwill be later in the morning because
OL,12,Fthe water evaporates before the pollen
OL,13,Fis released.
OL,15,FSome grasses release their pollen in
OL,16,Fthe afternoon. Pollen rises in the air
OL,17,Fduring the day and then descends at
OL,18,Fnight, as the air cools.

OL,5,FIn rural areas, the evening peak tends

OL,7,Fthe city, where the air stays warmer

OL,9,Fand levels tend to peak between 9pm
OL,10,Fand midnight or even later, which is
OL,11,Fwhy you may wake up sneezing in the
