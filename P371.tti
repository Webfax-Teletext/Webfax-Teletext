OL,7,FNeil Longden, who was the Environment

OL,9,FYorkshire, gave evidence to the
OL,10,Finquest, and was asked why there were

OL,12,Fwhich is next to the River Rother.
OL,14,FMr Longden said: "The answer really is
OL,15,Fyou can build something, but someone
OL,16,Fhas to pay for it.
OL,18,F"There is a feasible solution to the
