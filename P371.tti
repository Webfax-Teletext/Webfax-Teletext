OL,8,Frestructure the service to make sure
OL,9,Fthey are putting more crews where most
OL,10,Fincidents happen and because they say
OL,11,Fthey cannot recruit the number of on-

OL,13,Fcall crews work part-time alongside
OL,14,Fother jobs and can be at their local

OL,16,Fare on call.
OL,18,FThe Fire Service has now responded to
