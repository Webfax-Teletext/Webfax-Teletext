OL,6,FA dog walker from Nottingham had the
OL,7,Fshock of his life when a branch he
OL,8,Fthought looked like a snake turned out
OL,9,Fto be exactly that - a six-foot boa
OL,10,Fimpersonator snake.
OL,12,FThe reptile, which is usually found in
OL,13,Fthe jungles of Brazil, was sunbathing
OL,14,Fon the gravel path in Colwick Park at
OL,15,Faround 4pm on Thursday 18 July when it
OL,16,Fwas spotted by local man Sean Dirrane.
OL,18,FSean had been out for a stroll with
OL,19,Fhis one-year-old Springer Spaniel-
OL,20,FBorder Collie cross Bow when he
OL,21,Fstumbled upon the unlikely spectacle.
