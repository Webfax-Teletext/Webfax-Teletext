OL,7,Ffacing backlash following his remarks
OL,8,Fregarding recent street disorders in
OL,9,Fthe UK.
OL,11,FThe Newark MP, who is vying for
OL,12,Fleadership of the Conservative Party,
OL,13,Faccused Sir Keir Starmer of not being
OL,14,F"as clear as he could be" about the
OL,15,Finvolvement of "sectarian gangs" in
OL,16,Fsome of the unrest.
OL,18,FSpeaking to Sky News, he said Muslims
OL,19,Fshould be arrested for saying "Allahu
OL,20,FAkbar" in public. The everyday phrase
OL,21,Fmeans "God is great" in Arabic.

OL,6,FThis comes amid a broader debate over
OL,7,Fthe handling of recent far-right riots
OL,8,Fand other protests.
OL,10,FSir Keir Starmer has dismissed these
OL,11,Faccusations as a "non-issue,"
OL,12,Fmaintaining that policing is conducted
OL,13,F"without fear or favour."
