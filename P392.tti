OL,6,FMr Wright said: "Then you say 'in fact

OL,8,Fpunishing this child?"
OL,10,FThe defendant said: "I was not

OL,6,FRoughley replied: "I'm not sure. All I
OL,7,Fknow is when checked Genevieve each
OL,8,Fand every time. Even the last time,
OL,9,Fher face was always visible and never
OL,10,Fface down."
OL,12,FThe defence says Genevieve died as a
OL,13,Fresult of a "tragic and unavoidable
OL,14,Faccident".
OL,16,FIf further questioning, Mr Wright said
OL,17,Fto Roughley: "My suggestion to you is
OL,18,Fthat you deliberately pinned that
OL,19,Fchild face down in that bean bag."
