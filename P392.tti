OL,6,FA landlord has blamed people working
OL,7,Ffrom home as the reason why his pub
OL,8,Fhas been forced to close.
OL,10,FJeremy Brunning, who runs basement pub
OL,11,FThe Henry Potts in Chester, said the
OL,12,Fcity had turned into a "ghost town" as
OL,13,Fnobody was coming in to go to offices
OL,14,Fanymore.
OL,16,FReferencing working from home and
OL,17,F"ridiculous electricity bills", he
OL,18,Fsaid it was "with great sadness and
OL,19,Fnot a little irritation" that the pub
OL,20,Fwas closing.

OL,6,FMr Brunning said: "I think we'd easily
OL,7,Fhave been able to make it if more
OL,8,Fpeople were in their offices and keen
OL,9,Ffor lunch and early evening
OL,10,Frefreshment, but most seem to be
OL,11,Fworking from home.
OL,13,F"The commercial heart of Chester is a
OL,14,Fbit of a ghost town."
OL,16,FIn the statement, he continued: "It's
OL,17,Fa beautiful pub, like a cosy little
OL,18,Funderground hideaway with excellent
OL,19,Fstaff and the best quality food and
OL,20,Fdrink.

OL,6,F"However, it's simply not doing enough

OL,10,Felectricity bills and a host of other
