OL,6,FThe last surviving member of the
OL,7,FSummerland fire research team says the
OL,8,F'misadventure' ruling given to those
OL,9,Fwho died in 1973 is a "strange
OL,10,Fverdict".
OL,12,FJohn Webb was part of a team of
OL,13,Fexperts who went into the building on
OL,14,Fthe Isle of Man four days after the
OL,15,Ffire, working with a team from the
OL,16,FFire Research Station in 1973 to find
OL,17,Fthe cause of the blaze.

OL,6,FWhile taking photographs of what

OL,8,Fdiscovered that a key piece of
OL,9,Fevidence was missing.
OL,11,FJohn said: "Basically it is us

OL,13,Fwhy it spread so rapidly.

OL,6,FThe outer wall material had been

OL,8,Fcladding called galbestos, a material
OL,9,Fthat was used to save money, but was

OL,12,F"It surprised all of us, particularly

OL,6,FIn his view, the factors that led to

OL,8,Fstarted with the original design.
OL,10,F"There were a lack of escape routes

OL,12,Fshould have sounded the alarm when the
