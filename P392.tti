OL,7,FSchool dinner time is always busy, but
OL,8,Fit can also be costly. The children at
OL,9,FMonksdown Primary School in Liverpool
OL,10,Fenjoy hot lunches, but many are paying
OL,11,Faround 2 pounds a day, so more than
OL,12,Ften pounds a week.
OL,14,FIt is a cost that mounts up for
OL,15,Ffamilies already feeling the pinch in
OL,16,Fthe cost of living crisis.

OL,7,FSo the children have gone right to the
OL,8,Ftop, writing to the Prime Minister and
OL,9,Fjoining a national campaign urging the
OL,10,FGovernment to provide free school
OL,11,Fmeals to every child in England.
OL,13,FOne pupil said "I think it's terrible
OL,14,Fbecause Scotland, Wales and London
OL,15,Fhave free school meals so why can't
OL,16,FEngland."
OL,18,FAnother said "When you are in year 2
OL,19,Fyou don't have to pay, but when you
OL,20,Fare in year 3 parents have to put
OL,21,Faside like lots and lots of money"

OL,7,FThere is a foodbank known as the

OL,7,FTeacher Marie Ferrigan siad "It's
OL,8,Factually the family where two wages
OL,9,Fare coming in where on paper they have
OL,10,Fa steady wage and they don't actually
OL,11,Fqualify for anything at all. That's
OL,12,Fwhy the free school meal came about
OL,13,Fwhen we were looking at it. It was
OL,14,Fthose families who were using the
OL,15,Fpantry."
OL,17,FIt's a year since free school meals
OL,18,Fwere extended to every child in London
OL,19,Fand already the benefits are clear
OL,20,Fwith nearly 80% of parents saying it
OL,21,Fhas helped their budget.
