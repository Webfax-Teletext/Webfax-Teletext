OL,6,FIn 2023, he created a batch of about
OL,7,F30 calendars dedicated to electricity

OL,10,F"The British love that sort of inane
OL,11,Fdetail and like to celebrate the odd
OL,12,Fand the specific so I was hoping it
OL,13,Fwould have a positive response," said
OL,14,FStuart, from Crumpsall, Manchester.
OL,16,F"It actually sold really well ` much

OL,18,Ftipping the first batch into the paper

OL,6,FThe calendar proved so popular that
OL,7,FStuart has created a second edition
OL,8,Ffor 2025, which he described as more
OL,9,F"arty and photogenic".
OL,11,FStuart, who works for a hazardous
OL,12,Fwaste company, thought: "Why spend
OL,13,Fhours stuck in traffic on the M60 when
OL,14,Fyou can look at pictures of it in your
OL,15,Fown home?"
OL,17,FWhile he admits that the calendars are
OL,18,F"a bit tongue in cheek", he hopes they
OL,19,Fwill "bring a smile to people's faces".
