OL,6,FIt is unknown where the horses had

OL,8,Fsuspected they had escaped from a
OL,9,Flocal farm.
OL,11,FShe said: "I felt quite scared. At one

OL,13,Fthe eye and almost looked like they
OL,14,Fwere coming straight towards my car as
OL,15,Fopposed to weaving in and out of

OL,19,Flots of cars on both sides but the
OL,20,Fhorses were completely unaccompanied
OL,21,Fand doing their own thing.
