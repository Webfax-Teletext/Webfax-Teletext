OL,9,FFeeling as healthy as ever, he could

OL,11,FHowever, his decision to attend the
OL,12,Fscreening turned out to be life-saving.
OL,14,FOn Christmas Eve 2021, Gordon was
OL,15,Fdiagnosed with stage one lung cancer.
OL,16,FThe news came as a shock. "I couldn't
OL,17,Funderstand how I could have lung
OL,18,Fcancer and not feel ill or have any
OL,19,Fsymptoms." Gordon recalls.

OL,6,FThanks to the early detection, Gordon
OL,7,Funderwent keyhole surgery to remove
