OL,6,FInsp Beats said efforts to trace his

OL,8,FShe said: "This poor dog was in a
OL,9,Fstate, he was unable to stand, very
OL,10,Fthin and had pressure sores on his
OL,11,Fbody - a sign that he had been this
OL,12,Fway for quite some time.
OL,14,F"He isn't microchipped so sadly we're

OL,17,Fcame from to get in touch with us."
