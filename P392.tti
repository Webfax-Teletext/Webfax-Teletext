OL,5,FRunning from March to the end of

OL,7,Finto three main categories
OL,9,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,10,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,11,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilise other
OL,12,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,13,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,14,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.
OL,16,FThe immune system normally defends the

OL,5,FPollen counts tend to be higher in the

OL,10,FIf the grass is damp, the pollen peak
