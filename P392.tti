OL,8,Fdue to the rough sea and the ebbing

OL,6,FHoylake RNLI Coxswain Howie Owen said:
OL,7,F"Mechanical failure is the single
OL,8,Fbiggest cause of rescue call outs to
OL,9,Fsailing and motor cruisers, accounting
OL,10,Ffor nearly 20 per cent of all RNLI
OL,11,Flifeboat launches.
OL,13,F"In the challenging conditions, the
OL,14,Fcasualty made the right decision to
OL,15,Fraise the alarm when his yacht broke
OL,16,Fdown, particularly as he was sailing
OL,17,Falone. If you get into difficulty at
OL,18,Fsea, always call the Coastguard on VHF
OL,19,FChannel 16 or by dialling 999."
