OL,7,FA retired nurse who dedicated her life

OL,13,Fbeen enjoying retirement when she was
OL,14,Frushed to Royal Blackburn Hospital on
OL,15,F19 September 2023.
OL,17,FHer family described her as 'fit and
OL,18,Fhealthy'. She hadn't been to visit her
OL,19,FGP in more than three decades and had
OL,20,Fnever gone to A&E before.
