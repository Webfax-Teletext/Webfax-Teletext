OL,6,FThe Thirlwall Inquiry, which has been
OL,7,Fset up to examine the circumstances
OL,8,Fsurrounding Letby's crimes, has heard
OL,9,Fthat Mrs Murphy had "no concerns"
OL,10,Fabout Letby at the time and saw "no
OL,11,Findication" that she was causing harm
OL,12,Fto babies.
OL,14,F"I couldn't understand why it was
OL,15,Fhappening," she said. "So I have to
OL,16,Fapologise to all of those families
OL,17,Ffrom my perspective that I feel that I
OL,18,Fcertainly failed those children by not
OL,19,Fdoing something sooner."
