OL,13,FMrs Pearce said "When the incident

OL,15,Fput a call out for bears as it was not
OL,16,Fjust the families that were affected
OL,17,Fby it, it was all the children that
OL,18,Flost their friends, so I thought it
OL,19,Fwould be a good idea to give a bear to
OL,20,Fchildren so that they had a friend,"
