OL,6,FJust a few hours beforehand, the Great
OL,7,FManchester Run saw thousands of
OL,8,Frunners take to the city centre
OL,9,Fstreets, with Deansgate also acting as
OL,10,Fthe finish line.
OL,12,FBoth events lead to a busy day in
OL,13,FManchester, and a series of road
OL,14,Fclosures have been put in place to
OL,15,Fensure both events run smoothly.
OL,17,FFans planning to attend have therefore
OL,18,Fbeen asked to rely on public
OL,19,Ftransport, and organisers are asking
OL,20,Fthey travel light and do bring glass
OL,21,Fbottles to the parade.
