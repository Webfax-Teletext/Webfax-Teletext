OL,6,FThe first moment that cost Villa
OL,7,Funusually involved their goalkeeper
OL,8,FEmi Martinez. PSG did one of their
OL,9,Flightning quick breaks and Martinez
OL,10,Fcame to intercept the ball.
OL,12,FHis usual standards would demand he
OL,13,Fheld on or at least pushed it away
OL,14,Ffrom the onrushing Achraf Hakimi but
OL,15,Finstead it was a goal that sucked the
OL,16,Fbelief out of Villa Park.
OL,18,FAlmost every club in the world
OL,19,Fwould've crumbled in that situation so
OL,20,Fit is to Villa's credit that they
OL,21,Fmounted such a rousing comeback.

OL,6,FFirst Youri Tielemans got some luck
OL,7,Fwith a deflection and then, after the

OL,9,Flike a bull.
OL,11,FHe ran 50 yards with the ball before
OL,12,Funleashing a shot that also clipped a

OL,15,FThen Marcus Rashford went on a mazy

OL,7,Fthat left me wondering what if?
OL,8,FRashford whipped in a free kick and

OL,11,FIt looked like any connection would be

OL,15,Fas agonising.
OL,17,FI'm reluctant to talk about
