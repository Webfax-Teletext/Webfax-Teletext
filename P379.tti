OL,6,FWolverhampton Wanderers were our
OL,7,Fbusiest Premier League club on the
OL,8,Ffinal day of the transfer window, but
OL,9,Fit's more a sign of building for the
OL,10,Ffuture than saving this season.
OL,12,FWolves are bottom of the table and 18
OL,13,Fpoints off safety, so it would be
OL,14,Fnaive in the extreme not to think
OL,15,Fabout the Championship.
OL,17,FAs a previously established Premier
OL,18,FLeague club, they should have a big
OL,19,Fbudget for a club in the league below.

OL,8,Ffrom a penalty.
OL,10,FThat came off the back of him wanting
