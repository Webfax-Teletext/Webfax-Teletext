OL,16,F"There had to have special measures

OL,7,FAt 14, Neil's health deteriorated
OL,8,Ffurther. Hospitalised with a suspected
OL,9,Fruptured appendix, he encountered a
OL,10,Flack of compassion that compounded his
OL,11,Fsuffering.
OL,13,FHe said: "The rooms were padlocked and

OL,16,Ffrom London to come and do the
