OL,6,FThis week's reopening of the hospital
OL,7,Fbeds at Bishop's Castle Community
OL,8,FHospital felt like a real example of
OL,9,F'people power' in action.
OL,11,FThe 16 beds closed 'temporarily' back
OL,12,Fin October 2021 because a lack of
OL,13,Fstaff meant it was unsafe to keep them
OL,14,Fopen.
OL,16,FBut after nearly two years of closure
OL,17,Fand no sign of reopening, local
OL,18,Fresidents started campaigning to
OL,19,Fchange that last August.

OL,12,FThe reason they want the beds so much
OL,13,Fis because the town is in rural
