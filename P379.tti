OL,12,FWildlife Trust said: "We had a bit of

OL,14,Fwhen 33 brought this colossal fish
OL,15,Fback to the nest, which unfortunately
OL,16,Fwasn't quite dead and flipped on to
OL,17,Fthe chick, a bit reminiscent of last
OL,18,Fyear.

OL,8,Ffrom the nest, it looked as though the
OL,9,Fchick was unharmed, but unfortunately
OL,10,Fit had been displaced to the side of
OL,11,Fthe nest.
OL,13,F"In the process of the the fish
OL,14,Fhitting it. We watched this sort of

OL,17,Freally was trapped at the side of the
