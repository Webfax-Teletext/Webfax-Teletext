OL,6,FTwo acorns, planted by John Lennon and
OL,7,FYoko Ono at 55 years ago, have gone on
OL,8,Fdisplay at the Beatles Museum after
OL,9,Fbeing seized from a drunk driver.
OL,11,FThe couple visited the cathedral in
OL,12,F1968 to create a living art sculpture
OL,13,Fat the start of their campaign for
OL,14,Fpeace, with a wrought iron bench to
OL,15,Fsurround where the two oak trees would
OL,16,Fgrow.
OL,18,FHowever the sculpture reportedly
OL,19,Fcaused upset with the cathedral canon,
OL,20,Fand within a week the acorns had
OL,21,Fdisappeared and removed the bench.

OL,6,FNow, more than 55 years after they
OL,7,Fwere planted, the acorns have made
OL,8,Ftheir way to the Liverpool Beatles

OL,13,FMr Davies said they had been brought

OL,15,Fof about 19 or 20, who had been caught
OL,16,Fdrink-driving outside Bedworth a few

OL,6,FThe 88-year-old said the driver, who
OL,7,Flooked like a 'typical lad about
OL,8,Ftown', and his girlfriend were Beatles
OL,9,Ffans who had returned to the cathedral
OL,10,Fafter the planting ceremony and stolen
OL,11,Fthe acorns, coating them in clear nail
OL,12,Fvarnish to preserve them.
OL,14,FBecause the acorns had no owner and,
OL,15,Fat the time, no value, Mr Davies said
OL,16,Fhe could not charge the couple with
OL,17,Ftheft.

OL,6,FHe said: "They walked and the acorns
OL,7,Fwere left. It was no good taking them
OL,8,Fback and replanting them because they
OL,9,Fwere covered in nail varnish so
OL,10,Fwouldn't grow.
OL,12,F"They were in my desk until I retired
OL,13,Fin 1980 when I put them in a cardboard
OL,14,Fbox and that's where they remained
OL,15,Funtil I decided to start clearing out
OL,16,Fmy own personal things."
OL,18,FWhen Mr Davies came across the acorns
OL,19,Flast year it took him a moment to
OL,20,Fremember the story behind them.

OL,10,FThe great-grandfather, from Nuneaton,
