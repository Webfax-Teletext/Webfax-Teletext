OL,6,FIt was back in 2019 when Virginia
OL,7,FWairimu says she was forced on her
OL,8,Fjourney to seek asylum.
OL,10,FShe'd been outed as a lesbian in her

OL,12,Fseeking sanctuary and safety in the UK.
OL,14,FThe Home Office has since rejected her

OL,16,Fsays her evidence is inconsistent, and
OL,17,Fthat she hasn't provided enough
