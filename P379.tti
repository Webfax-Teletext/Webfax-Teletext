OL,6,FThe trial had heard Hollick's ex-
OL,7,Fpartner Adina Johnson had dropped
OL,8,Ftheir son off at his home as usual on
OL,9,F7 February for the weekend and while
OL,10,FKairo had a cold at the time, she had
OL,11,Fno other concerns about his health.
OL,13,FHollick was staying in the
OL,14,Fconservatory at his parents' home due
OL,15,Fto a lack of bedroom space after
OL,16,Fmoving back in with them when his

OL,6,FThe court heard Hollick phoned Ms

OL,8,Fshe did not answer because of the

OL,10,Fwould call him back later on.
OL,12,FHollick immediately sent her a message
OL,13,Ftelling her to "ring him back, it's
OL,14,Fabout Kai".
OL,16,FThe last person to see Kairo alive and
OL,17,Fwell was Hollick's brother James, who
OL,18,Fwent into the conservatory at around
OL,19,Fmidnight and saw them sleeping.
