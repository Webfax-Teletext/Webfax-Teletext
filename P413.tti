OL,7,Fout of a "decades-long decline" with a

OL,11,FPlum production in the UK hit its peak
OL,12,Fin 1987 with 28,900 tonnes being
OL,13,Fproduced that year, according to Defra
OL,14,Ffigures.
OL,16,FDue to lower yields and cheaper
OL,17,Fimports, the industry then declined,
OL,18,Fhitting its lowest point in 2008 with
OL,19,Ftotal production of just 2,500 tonnes.
