OL,6,FAn 82 year old veteran with advanced
OL,7,Flung cancer said he's been trapped in
OL,8,Fhis Southampton flat for more than
OL,9,Ffour months because of a broken lift.
OL,11,FFormer Royal Marine Terry Manley
OL,12,Frelies on a wheelchair and says
OL,13,Fwithout the lift, he's unable to leave
OL,14,Fhis first-floor flat and is fearful of
OL,15,Fmissing vital hospital appointments.
OL,17,F"I need the lift just to go up one
OL,18,Fflight of stairs to get to a car," he
OL,19,Fsaid. "The trouble is, the longer I
OL,20,Fstay here, I start feeling depressed."

OL,6,FThe lift in Terry's social housing
OL,7,Fblock, run by Sanctuary Housing, has
OL,8,Fbeen out of order since June. He said
OL,9,Fproblems with it have been ongoing for
OL,10,Fyears - and that he's even been
OL,11,Ftrapped inside twice, needing
OL,12,Ffirefighters to rescue him.
OL,14,FOther residents, many of them elderly,
OL,15,Fare also affected. Terry relies on his
OL,16,Fpartner and carer Carol to help him.
OL,18,F"We're all old, walking up stairs it's
OL,19,Fjust not on," Carol said. "It's
OL,20,Fdesperately needed. We feel totally
OL,21,Fneglected."
