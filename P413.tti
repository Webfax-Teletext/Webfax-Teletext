OL,6,FThe Chief Fire Officer of Oxfordshire
OL,7,FFire and Rescue Service has reassured
OL,8,Fthe public that proposed plans to cut
OL,9,Fservices won't impact safety.
OL,11,FRob Macdougall said any changes that
OL,12,Fcould be made, will be done to make
OL,13,Fsure vital services are still
OL,14,Favailable. The service, which is ran
OL,15,Fby Oxfordshire County Council, is
OL,16,Fconsulting on plans that could mean
OL,17,Fthree on-call fire stations will close.

OL,11,FMacdougall said they "will always send

OL,17,F"The modelling has shown us that in

OL,8,Fthe availability of on-call crews to

OL,11,FDemand is greatest during the day so
