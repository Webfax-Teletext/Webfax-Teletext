OL,8,Ffrustration of being stuck in traffic.
OL,9,FHowever, we close roads for only as
OL,10,Flong as is necessary, whether that's

OL,16,F"Those using the hard shoulder for
OL,17,Fanything other than a lawful reason
OL,18,Fcould obstruct emergency vehicles
OL,19,Fheading towards a serious collision,
OL,20,Fimpacting injured drivers.
