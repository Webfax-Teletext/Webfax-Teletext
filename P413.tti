OL,7,Ftheir frustration about the
OL,8,F"nightmare" disruption caused by
OL,9,Frepairs to a sewer underneath one of
OL,10,Fthe city's main streets.
OL,12,FEastern Road is closed in one
OL,13,Fdirection for a total of eight weeks
OL,14,Fso that Southern Water can carry out
OL,15,Fwhat it describes as "essential" works
OL,16,Fto a sewer line which has burst
OL,17,Fsixteen times over the last five years.

OL,6,FAlthough local people acknowledge the
OL,7,Fimportance of the works, there is
OL,8,Fconcerns over communication around the
OL,9,Fworks, and the knock-on effect that
OL,10,Fthey are having on traffic.
OL,12,FSouthern Water says that the repairs,
OL,13,Fwhich are costing #3.5 million, are
OL,14,Fcrucial to prevent widespread future
OL,15,Fdisruption from the sewers bursting
