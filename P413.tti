OL,8,Fcut speed limits to 20mph in three
OL,9,Fareas of Woodley and Earley.
OL,11,FThe council says the decision was made
OL,12,Fto improve safety for all road users,
OL,13,Famid plans for a new walking and
OL,14,Fcycling route.
OL,16,FBut it follows a public consultation -
OL,17,Fthe results of which revealed more
OL,18,Fthan half the respondents were against
OL,19,Fthe measures, with some saying it will
OL,20,Fcause delays and bottlenecks.

OL,12,FResidents who felt the lower speed
