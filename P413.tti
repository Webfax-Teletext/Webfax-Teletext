OL,9,FEngland can be severe, especially away
OL,10,Ffrom coastal areas. This is due to
OL,11,Frelatively long growing seasons and
OL,12,Flow rainfall, which result in a large
OL,13,Fnumber of days with high pollen

OL,14,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,15,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,16,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,17,Fplants of the same species. Many

OL,5,FThe immune system normally defends the

OL,10,FSome peoples immune system mistakenly

OL,5,FA pollen count is generated by
OL,6,Fmeasuring the number of pollen grains
OL,7,Fin a given volume of air, using a
OL,8,Fpollen trap.
OL,10,FWhat effect does time of day and

OL,13,FPollen counts tend to be higher in the
OL,14,Fearly morning and late evening,
OL,15,Falthough they can sometimes be high
OL,16,Fall day long.
OL,18,FIf the grass is damp, the pollen peak

OL,5,FSome grasses release their pollen in
