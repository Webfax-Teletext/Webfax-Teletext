OL,7,FHotel tycoon Surinder Arora has
OL,8,Fpublished a Heathrow expansion plan
OL,9,Fwhich rivals a proposal from the
OL,10,Fairport's owners.
OL,12,FThe billionaire's Arora Group said the
OL,13,F"primary benefit" of the plan it
OL,14,Fsubmitted to the Government is a
OL,15,Fshorter new runway which would avoid
OL,16,Fthe costly and disruptive need to
OL,17,Fdivert the M25 motorway.
