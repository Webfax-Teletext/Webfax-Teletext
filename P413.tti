OL,7,FEnvironmentalist Chris Packham has
OL,8,Fsaid he "loathed himself" and thought
OL,9,Fhe was "broken" as a teenager before
OL,10,Fhe understood he had autism.
OL,12,FThe Springwatch presenter, 62, who
OL,13,Flives in the New Forest, was only
OL,14,Fdiagnosed at the age of 44 after he
OL,15,Fdated a healthcare professional, and
OL,16,Fsaid he struggled in his teens to
OL,17,Funderstand why he was different.

OL,7,FSpeaking about the currently lengthy
