OL,6,FWildlife expert, Chris Packham, has

OL,8,Fthe potential expansion of Gatwick
OL,9,FAirport should be halted.
OL,11,FThe West Sussex site wants to bring

OL,13,Fin what it says would be a sustainable
OL,14,Fand climate conscious way.
OL,16,FCurrently, Gatwick is the world's

OL,6,FChris Packham today told ITV Meridian
OL,7,Fthe emergency runway should not be
OL,8,Fbrought into use until the aviation
OL,9,Findustry can prove it is sustainable.
OL,11,FHe understood that investment needs to

OL,13,Fon moving away from fossil fuels first.
