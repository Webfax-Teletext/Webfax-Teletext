OL,6,FThe NHS has begun giving patients a
OL,7,Fnew DIY heart monitor which looks for
OL,8,Fheart rhythm problems.
OL,10,FTraditional monitors can require
OL,11,Flengthy set-up by a trained
OL,12,Fphysiologist, but the new kit can be
OL,13,Fsent out to patients in the post for
OL,14,Fthem to attach themselves at home.
OL,16,FThe device looks like a small patch
OL,17,Fwhich is stuck to the skin, while
OL,18,Ftraditional devices see patients
OL,19,Fhooked up to numerous wires and
OL,20,Fmonitors.
