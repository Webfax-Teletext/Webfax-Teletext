OL,6,FThe mother-of-two, from Axminster in
OL,7,FDevon, had agreed to stay in a twin

OL,10,Fto feel lonely" on his birthday, the
OL,11,Fjury was told.
OL,13,FHe phoned 999 at around 8.30am the

OL,15,Fdiscovered her dead beside him in bed.
OL,17,FOn Thursday, a jury unanimously
OL,18,Fconvicted him of murder and rape, but
OL,19,Facquitted him of controlling or
OL,20,Fcoercive behaviour.
