OL,6,FThe sister of Reading headteacher Ruth
OL,7,FPerry has said that delays to Ofsted
OL,8,Freforms are "putting more lives at
OL,9,Frisk".
OL,11,FProfessor Julia Waters spoke at the
OL,12,Fannual conference of the National
OL,13,FEducation Union in Bournemouth on
OL,14,FFriday 5 April.
OL,16,FRuth Perry took her own life after an

OL,6,FLast month Sir Martyn Oliver, chief
OL,7,Finspector of Ofsted, launched the
OL,8,Fwatchdog's Big Listen public
OL,9,Fconsultation that will seek views
OL,10,Fabout Ofsted.
OL,12,FIn his first major speech since
OL,13,Fbecoming chief inspector in January,
OL,14,FSir Martyn said he wanted to "mark a
OL,15,Fnew chapter" with the sector.
OL,17,FBut during her speech, Prof Waters
OL,18,Fsuggested there was a lot of "passing
OL,19,Fthe buck going on between government
OL,20,Fand Ofsted" and "unnecessary delay".
