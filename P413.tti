OL,6,FThames Water has been fined #18.2
OL,7,Fmillion by regulator, Ofwat, over
OL,8,F'unjustified' dividend payments to
OL,9,Fshareholders.
OL,11,FOfwat said the fine was for paying
OL,12,F#158.3 million in dividends to
OL,13,Fshareholders in October 2023 and March
OL,14,F2024, which Ofwat says breached
OL,15,Fcondition P30 of its licence.
OL,17,FThe regulator said it will claw back
OL,18,F#131.3 million of the payments so it
OL,19,Fdoes not come out of customer bills.

OL,11,FOfwat disagreed with this assessment,
OL,12,Fsaying the payments resulted in 'the
OL,13,Fextraction of value' from Thames Water.
OL,15,FThames Water also told Ofwat the
OL,16,Fpayments were 'in the best interests

OL,18,Fwhich Ofwat said it was 'not convinced
