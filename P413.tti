OL,6,FThe new technology takes a series of

OL,9,Ftaking place.
OL,11,FMayor Dan Beauchamp said: "Those funds
OL,12,Fwill have to come from somewhere, and
OL,13,Fbeing a small parish council,
OL,14,Fnaturally it starts to look like it's

OL,17,F"It means an extra burden on people's
OL,18,Fcouncil taxes as well, most likely."
