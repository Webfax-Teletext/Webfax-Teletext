OL,5,F"I have never known life not speaking
OL,6,Fit. It's not very technical but I can
OL,7,Fget away with general conversation.
OL,9,F"I arrived aged 18 in 1941. My work
OL,10,Fwas always clerical. Boring in a way
OL,11,Fbut necessary. Everything that came in
OL,12,Ffrom our signals people had to be
OL,13,Frecorded in date order. It was just a
OL,14,Fset of groups of five letters and
OL,15,Ffigures and that was all.

OL,5,F"It was then up to the decoders to try
OL,6,Fto make sense of it. You were not
OL,7,Fallowed to speak to anyone outside
OL,8,Fyour own office about what you had
OL,9,Fheard or saw. That we had to keep
OL,10,Funtil 1975.
OL,12,F"At the time we were not told about
OL,13,Fwhat was going on. Everything was
OL,14,Fclosely guarded in the way of
OL,15,Finformation. Not until later years
OL,16,Fhave we been able to put the story
OL,17,Ftogether."

OL,5,F"The codebreakers also discovered that

OL,8,Flandings would be around Calais and

OL,5,F"Our chaps were exercising and

OL,7,Fforget there were a couple of guards
OL,8,Fofficers who stopped my ambulance and
OL,9,Fthey were dressed up as Germans and
OL,10,Fthey wanted a lift.
