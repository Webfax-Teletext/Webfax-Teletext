OL,6,FA leading professor from Oxford says
OL,7,F40 years of inaction led to thousands
OL,8,Fof children being harmed by a drug
OL,9,Fused to treat epilepsy.
OL,11,FCarl Heneghan runs the Centre for
OL,12,FEvidence-Based Medicine and says
OL,13,Fserious failings led to generations of
OL,14,Fchildren suffering disabilities caused
OL,15,Fby sodium valproate.
OL,17,FSodium valproate has been used for
OL,18,Fdecades to save the lives of women
OL,19,Fwith epilepsy, but it has also been
OL,20,Fharming babies.
