OL,9,FWorking in a firm helping the war
OL,10,Feffort, Mary Holley met her late
OL,11,Fhusband Roy before he joined the Royal
OL,12,FNavy and was sent to the Far East with
OL,13,Fthe battleship HMS Frobisher.
OL,15,FThey married two months before D-Day

OL,5,FShe said: "D-Day was coming up. They
OL,6,Fhad seven days and that was that. He
OL,7,Fcame home on Monday and we married on
OL,8,FWednesday and then he went back to his
OL,9,Fship on the second Monday."
OL,11,FMrs Holley, like others, suspected
OL,12,Fsome military operation was about to
OL,13,Fhappen and that her new husband's ship
OL,14,Fhad returned.
OL,16,F"Before D-Day - months before - the
OL,17,Fwhole of the South coast was cordoned
OL,18,Foff," she said.

OL,5,F"And only people who lived or worked
OL,6,Fthere could go. We all suspected. I
OL,7,Fknew he was on Frobisher, I knew she
OL,8,Fwas a cruiser so she would have been
OL,9,Fup in the forefront.
OL,11,F"They were in the bombardment of Gold
OL,12,FBeach each and it must have worked
OL,13,Fbecause he was one of the signalmen
OL,14,Fsent ashore. I don't know how,
OL,15,Fpresumably by tender. To set up a
OL,16,Fsignal station on the beach.
OL,18,F"It must of been after that that she
OL,19,Fwas torpedoed.

OL,5,F"And they thought she was going to
OL,6,Fsink so the order was given that they
OL,7,Fshould abandon ship. With Roy you only
OL,8,Fheard the funny stories. He was below
OL,9,Fsomewhere and had to make his way up
OL,10,Fto deck. He picked up someone's
OL,11,Fbreakfast left on someone's plate so
OL,12,Fhe went into the sea carrying
OL,13,Fsomeone's breakfast.
OL,15,F"I don't know how long they were in
OL,16,Fthe sea. But the one thing he did say
OL,17,Fabout it was about the oily water they
OL,18,Fswallowed. So the ship didn't sink.

OL,5,F"And they were considered safer on
OL,6,Fboard than in the sea. I don't know
OL,7,Fwhat they did in the sea because if a
OL,8,Fship was going down you got away from
OL,9,Fit because you didn't want to be
OL,10,Fsucked in with all the water. So they
OL,11,Fmust have been some way away from the
OL,12,Fship.
