OL,7,FA HIV patient has been sharing the

OL,9,Fvirus after she feared she would die
OL,10,Fafter her positive diagnosis.
OL,12,FSue Hunter from Shoreham, Sussex,
OL,13,Ftested positive in 2006 and is on
OL,14,Fmedication. It involves taking one
OL,15,Fpill a day, which stops her from
OL,16,Fgetting unwell and has suppressed the
OL,17,Fvirus, so it is untransmissible.
