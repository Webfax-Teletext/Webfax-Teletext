OL,6,FThe leader of Gateshead Council has
OL,7,Fsaid he suspects the upper carriageway
OL,8,Fof the Gateshead flyover "will not

OL,11,FThe flyover and the road beneath it
OL,12,Fhas been closed since Friday evening
OL,13,F(13 December) after an inspection by
OL,14,Fstructural engineers indicated a
OL,15,Fpotential risk to safety.
OL,17,FBut on Monday (16 December), council
OL,18,Fleader Martin Gannon said the flyover
OL,19,Fhas clearly "reached the end of it's
