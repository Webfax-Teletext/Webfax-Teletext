OL,6,FIn the North East, between June 2023

OL,8,Freferred to Salvation Army as victims
OL,9,Fof modern slavery.
OL,11,FThis represents a decrease of 8%
OL,12,Fcompared to the previous year. It
OL,13,Freflects the wider figures for England
OL,14,Fand Wales which show, for the first

OL,16,Fnumber of people coming forward to
