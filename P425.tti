OL,7,FLynne Ebdale, founding director of the
OL,8,Fcharity, explained: "I got a phone
OL,9,Fcall about a week ago from a lady who
OL,10,Fwas very concerned because the duck
OL,11,Fwas going blind, and they'd been
OL,12,Ffeeding it for years on the pond.
OL,14,F"They'd noticed she was going downhill
OL,15,Fbecause her feathers were getting a
OL,16,Fbit tatty and torn, and she was
OL,17,Fobviously going blind."
OL,19,FGeraldine was adopted within an hour
OL,20,Fof arriving at the charity after two
OL,21,Fvolunteers decided to adopt her.

OL,12,F"It's so busy here we cannot give her

OL,16,F"She always needs to be warm and dry
