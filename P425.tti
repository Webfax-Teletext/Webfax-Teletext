OL,8,Fof Newcastle and Gateshead 170 years on
OL,10,FAn explosion 170 years ago this week
OL,11,Fsparked a fire that would forever
OL,12,Fchange the face of Newcastle and
OL,13,FGateshead.
OL,15,FMany on Tyneside believed the end of
OL,16,Fthe world was upon them in the early
OL,17,Fhours of 6 October 1854 as a fire took
OL,18,Fhold of Gateshead.

OL,6,FIt soon spread across the Tyne -
OL,7,Fclaiming the lives of 53 people and

OL,10,FThe Great Fire of Newcastle and

OL,16,FTom Elwick, from the Discovery Museum,

OL,11,FIt was a fatal combination.

OL,11,F"The chemicals inside would glow when
