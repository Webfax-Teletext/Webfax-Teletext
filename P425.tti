OL,10,FIt was the strike that defined a

OL,14,FSome 23,000 of the North East's men

OL,9,F"I knew there was no alternative," he
OL,10,Fsaid. "We came out on strike first.
OL,12,F"The first thing that we did was to go
OL,13,Fdown Woods Terrace. There were several
OL,14,Fbutcher shops there and we begged
OL,15,Ffood. We were going to make sheep's
OL,16,Fhead broth and they collected all the
OL,17,Fbones and everything like that and
OL,18,Fmade some broth.
OL,20,F"I had a mortgage. I'd bought a pit

OL,11,FCharlie Bell was a miner for 20 years.
OL,12,FHe told ITV Tyne Tees: "We didn't even

OL,15,FAnd was it difficult.
OL,17,F"Retired miners were still around to

OL,9,Fgone down as one of the most violent

OL,11,Fpicketers and police.
OL,13,FMiners have long said police were used

OL,10,FThe miners played a long game and
OL,11,Ffought a hard fight but in August
OL,12,F1984, the first North East miner - 'a
OL,13,Fscab'- crossed the picket line in
OL,14,FEasington.
OL,16,FMr Temple explained: "We used to say
OL,17,Fwe're poor, but we won't always be

OL,19,Fbe a scab."

OL,12,FFor some it was enough, for others it
