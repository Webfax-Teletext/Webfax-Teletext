OL,6,FNewcastle United fans are facing a
OL,7,Ftravel headache as they try to arrange
OL,8,Ftravel back from London due to an 8pm
OL,9,Fkick-off against Arsenal on Saturday
OL,10,Fnight.
OL,12,FThe game is the latest in a run of
OL,13,Fevening away games - with many of the
OL,14,Fmatches ending after the last trains
OL,15,Fhome, leaving fans to shell out on
OL,16,Faccommodation.
OL,18,FThe issue even reached Parliament
OL,19,Fearlier this month when it was raised
OL,20,Fduring a debate by the Labour MP for
OL,21,FGateshead Ian Mearns.

OL,6,F"The current feeling right now is it
OL,7,Fis a bit of a joke," explained Adam
OL,8,FStoker from fan group Wor Flags. "It
OL,9,Ffeels like fans are being exploited.
OL,11,F"In this case, the loyalty of
OL,12,FNewcastle fans and the fact we will
OL,13,Fjust travel anywhere regardless of the
OL,14,Ftime. There is a feeling that is being
OL,15,Fexploited at the moment."
OL,17,FSpeaking during his pre-match press
OL,18,Fconference, Newcastle head coach Eddie
OL,19,FHowe admitted he would like to see
OL,20,Fchanges as he shared his sympathy for

OL,8,F"They want to come and see their team

OL,11,F"It is not easy to get from Newcastle
OL,12,Fto London anyway but to do it at those

OL,14,Falmost impossible I would imagine. So
OL,15,Ffor me, they should be the first

OL,18,FThe increase of late fixtures is in

OL,7,Fto travelling supporters who have been
OL,8,Fforced to shell out more to support

OL,14,F"It is something we would like the

OL,16,Fcoming in soon to address," Mr Stoker
OL,17,Fsaid. "We understand that games are
