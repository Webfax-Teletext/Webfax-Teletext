OL,6,FHeather Wood lived in Easington, a pit
OL,7,Fvillage in East Durham, where life was
OL,8,Fbuilt around the mine.
OL,10,FShe experienced first-hand the full
OL,11,Fforce of the strike between the
OL,12,FMarches of 1984 and 1985, and the
OL,13,Fchallenges it brought.
OL,15,FSpeaking to ITV Tyne Tees now, Heather
OL,16,Fsaid she "knew what was happening in
OL,17,Fevery house" and it broke her heart.
OL,19,F"It broke my heart because these were
OL,20,Fgood people, strong people," she
OL,21,Fcontinued.

OL,6,F"They weren't asking for money, they

OL,10,FHeather had an idea to support hard-up
OL,11,Ffamilies and at Easington Colliery
OL,12,FClub she set up the region's first
OL,13,Fminers' food kitchen.
OL,15,F"The first thing on people's minds is

OL,19,FShe set about ringing her mother and

OL,6,FInitiatives like Heather's soon grew
OL,7,Finto women-led support groups across
OL,8,Fthe North East.
OL,10,FIn Seaham, the group there was a

OL,12,Fhusband was a miner on strike, and for
OL,13,Fwhom, with a toddler in tow, every day
OL,14,Fwas a struggle.
OL,16,F"Life was difficult," she told ITV

OL,17,FIn March 1985, the men went back to
OL,18,Fwork. They, and the women, may not
