OL,6,FAround 70 endangered crayfish have
OL,7,Fbeen found dead in Northumberland, the
OL,8,FEnvironment Agency has said.
OL,10,FAn investigation has now been launched
OL,11,Fby the organisation into the deaths as
OL,12,Fthe species is the only native
OL,13,Ffreshwater crayfish in the UK.
OL,15,FThe fish were found dead along the
OL,16,FRiver Wansbeck - one of the last
OL,17,Fstrongholds for the species.

OL,13,F"We know the native species is really
