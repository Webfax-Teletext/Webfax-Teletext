OL,6,FIn the letter sent on Sunday (25
OL,7,FNovember), Lord Houchen wrote: "I
OL,8,Fbelieve a visit to the North East of
OL,9,FEngland will ensure your trip is not
OL,10,Fdominated by a London-centric,
OL,11,Fmetropolitan, media-driven agenda, but
OL,12,Fcentre around real people and real

OL,15,FDescribing the region as being at the
OL,16,F"coalface of the real economy", the
OL,17,Fpolitician compared investment in the
OL,18,FNorth East to action in the American
OL,19,F'Rust Belt'.
