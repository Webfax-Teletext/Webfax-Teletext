OL,6,F"It was a complete stroke of luck that

OL,8,Fwalked his dogs there before," said
OL,9,FRSPCA inspector Steph Baines.
OL,11,F"It's also incredibly lucky that he
OL,12,Fwas interested enough to peer into the
OL,13,Fhole. But the biggest miracle is that
OL,14,Fhe even spotted the animal at the
OL,15,Fbottom of the shaft because it was
OL,16,Fincredibly dark and very deep.
OL,18,F"When he called us he believed it was

OL,20,Fwater at the bottom of the shaft.
