OL,8,F'real risk' of a measles outbreak in
OL,9,Four region, amid a rise in cases
OL,10,Felsewhere in the country.
OL,12,FParents are being urged to ensure
OL,13,Ftheir children receive both doses of
OL,14,Fthe two-part MMR vaccine, which
OL,15,Fprotects against measles, as well as

OL,13,FThe NHS states that both are needed to
