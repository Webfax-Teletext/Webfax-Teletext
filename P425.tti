OL,6,FThe Hexham MP has launched a bill in
OL,7,FParliament to create a register of
OL,8,Fculturally significant trees like the
OL,9,Fnow-felled Sycamore Gap Tree.
OL,11,FJoe Morris MP said the felling of the
OL,12,Ftree in his constituency "felt like an
OL,13,Fattack".
OL,15,FIn a speech in the House of Commons,
OL,16,Fhe said parliamentary colleagues often
OL,17,Fnickname him "the right honourable
OL,18,Fmember for Sycamore Gap." adding that
OL,19,Fnews of the tree did not just shock
OL,20,Fcommunities in the North of England,
OL,21,Fbut the whole country.
