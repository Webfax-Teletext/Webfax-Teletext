OL,7,FMr Smith said: "There's a lot of
OL,8,Fpeople in senior management jobs who
OL,9,Ffailed, nothing's happened to them and
OL,10,Fthere's been no personal
OL,11,Faccountability for that."
OL,13,FWhile Patient X's mother added:
OL,14,F"They're not just numbers, They're not
OL,15,Fjust nameless faces. They are family
OL,16,Fmembers, they are mothers, they are
OL,17,Fdaughters. Please just remember that."

OL,7,FFor many years, Christie's mother said
OL,8,Fshe carried the guilt of her
OL,9,Fdaughter's death. But now she knows
OL,10,Fshe was not to blame:
OL,12,F"No matter what I did it wouldn't have
OL,13,Fchanged anything," she said. "It
OL,14,Fwasn't my fault. It was their fault."
OL,16,FThe Trust's CEO, Brent Kilmurray, has
OL,17,Falso given a own statement, which
OL,18,Freads: "As we made clear in court
OL,19,Ftoday, we're deeply sorry for the
OL,20,Fevents that led to these tragedies.

OL,7,F"We didn't provide the care these two
OL,8,Fpeople deserved, and the guilty pleas
OL,9,Freflect that. Of course, that's no
OL,10,Fconsolation for Patient X and
OL,11,FChristy's loved ones, for which I
OL,12,Foffer our heartfelt apologies.
OL,14,F"The CQC has acknowledged in our
OL,15,Flatest inspection that improvements
OL,16,Fhave been made since then, however
OL,17,Ftoday is about being accountable and
