OL,11,FOver six months after leaving Northern

OL,10,F"We had a nice romantic walk along

OL,17,F"The location was special because

OL,6,FGian and Angela certainly attribute

OL,10,F"The Guinness and Bushmills might have

OL,13,F"We spent a lot of time in the pubs,
OL,14,Fof course, but Belfast is such a great
