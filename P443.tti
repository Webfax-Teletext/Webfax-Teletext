OL,6,FThe Health Minister has admitted that
OL,7,Fa "devastating" culture of poor
OL,8,Fbehaviour, exposed within Northern
OL,9,FIreland's cardiac surgery unit, could
OL,10,Fbe more widespread across the health
OL,11,Fservice.
OL,13,FMike Nesbitt told health committee
OL,14,Fmembers that his department was on
OL,15,Fstandby for other whistleblowers to
OL,16,Fcome forward, after UTV revealed the
OL,17,Fcontents of a report about the
OL,18,Fbehaviour of some heart surgeons at

OL,11,FOn Thursday, Health Committee chairman
OL,12,FPhilip McGuigan asked the minister
OL,13,Fwhen committee members and the public

OL,6,FHe said: "It was a devastating report,

OL,10,Fthere was a terrible breakdown in
