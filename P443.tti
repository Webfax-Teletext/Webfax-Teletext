OL,6,FThe Government is due to appeal an
OL,7,Finquest ruling, which found that SAS
OL,8,Fsoldiers were unjustified when they
OL,9,Fkilled four IRA men in Clonoe over 30
OL,10,Fyears ago.
OL,12,FThe soldiers opened fire on the group
OL,13,Fof men, after they had launched an
OL,14,Fattack on Coalisland Police station
OL,15,Fjust minutes beforehand.
OL,17,FPeter Clancy, Kevin Barry O'Donnell,
OL,18,FSean O'Farrell, and Patrick Vincent,
OL,19,Fdied when over 500 rounds were fired

OL,6,FLast month, coroner Mr Justice Michael
OL,7,FHumphreys found that the soldiers did
OL,8,Fnot have an honest belief in the
OL,9,Fnecessity of using lethal force.
OL,11,FIn his ruling, Mr Justice Humphreys
OL,12,Fsaid that no attempt was made by the
OL,13,Fsoldiers to arrest any of the members
OL,14,Fof the IRA unit, and the operation was
OL,15,Fnot planned and controlled in a way to
OL,16,Fminimise to the "greatest extent
OL,17,Fpossible" the need to use lethal force.
