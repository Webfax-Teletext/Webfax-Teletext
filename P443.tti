OL,7,Flawyer said police were sent to a
OL,8,Freport of an RTC in Asda carpark in
OL,9,FDundonald and when they arrived, Gray
OL,10,Fwas in the driver's seat of a VW Golf.
OL,12,FHe failed an initial preliminary
OL,13,Fbreath test and an evidential sample
OL,14,Fgave a reading of 189, more than five
