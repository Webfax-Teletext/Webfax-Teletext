OL,6,FThe Lammas Fair is a Ballycastle
OL,7,Finstitution having been part of the
OL,8,Ftown for around 400 years - however,
OL,9,Fthere are a number of challenges
OL,10,Ffacing the annual event.
OL,12,FOne issue is the Antrim Arms Hotel
OL,13,Fwhich stands derelict in the Diamond
OL,14,Farea of the town which, traditionally,
OL,15,Fis at the heart of the fair.
OL,17,FWith this, the Council has installed
OL,18,Fshipping containers to help provide
OL,19,Fsafe access between the Diamond area
OL,20,Fand Fairhill Street.
