OL,6,FCommunities Minister Gordon Lyons has
OL,7,Fdefended his decision to meet with a
OL,8,Fgroup which represents loyalist
OL,9,Fparamilitaries.
OL,11,FMr Lyons was one of two DUP ministers
OL,12,Fwho faced criticism after holding
OL,13,Fseparate meetings with the LCC, which
OL,14,Fincludes representatives of the Ulster
OL,15,FVolunteer Force, Ulster Defence
OL,16,FAssociation and Red Hand Commando.

OL,6,FMr Lyons said there had been a

OL,8,Fsince the meeting.
OL,10,FHe said: "Unlike some, I will never

OL,13,Fglorify it and unlike some I will
OL,14,Fnever adhere to the notion that there

OL,17,FMr Lyons told the committee the LCC
OL,18,Fwas representing those who "want to
OL,19,Fmove away from paramilitary activity".
