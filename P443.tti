OL,9,FOn Monday, the families of two men who
OL,10,Fwere murdered by loyalist
OL,11,Fparamilitaries almost 50 years ago
OL,12,Fwere told they were to receive

OL,6,FAn investigation by the now-defunct

OL,8,Fwas likely there had been collusion
OL,9,Fbetween individual members of the

OL,11,Ffor murdering Mr Toland in his
OL,12,Fworkplace at the Happy Landing Bar in

OL,14,Funable to rule out collusion in Mr
OL,15,FLoughrey's killing at his home in
OL,16,FGreysteel the previous week.
OL,18,FOn Monday, the MoD and PSNI settled
OL,19,Fthe cases with no admission of
