OL,6,FKlaire Tanner, Chair of Cymru Pride
OL,7,FWales, said: "Our hopes are that
OL,8,Fpeople come and get that sense of
OL,9,Fcommunity and they no longer feel
OL,10,Falone."
OL,12,FThey continued: "We're actually
OL,13,Fbringing it back home by bringing it
OL,14,Fto the island.
OL,16,F"What we know as North Wales Pride
OL,17,Ftoday originated in Mona Showground
OL,18,Fwith Mardi Gras."
OL,20,FFrom there, the event evolved into
OL,21,FNorth Wales Pride.

OL,6,F"It's good to be in the centre of

OL,8,Fwas being able to bring everybody from
OL,9,Faround the island into the centre of
OL,10,Fthe island," Klaire said.
OL,12,F"Being in Llangefni and bringing Pride
OL,13,Fto them, I just think it makes it more
OL,14,Faccessible for those in rural areas.
OL,15,FThey don't need to go to Liverpool or
OL,16,Fgo to Manchester - it's come to them.
