OL,7,FWrexham got themselves ahead against a
OL,8,Fstruggling Blackburn side after just
OL,9,Ften minutes. Matty James hoisted a
OL,10,Flong ball over the Rovers defence
OL,11,Fwhere he found striker Sam Smith, who
OL,12,Ffired past Aynsley Pears in goal.
OL,14,FA missed clearance by Blackburn as
OL,15,Fhalf time approached gave Wrexham the
OL,16,Fopening for the second, but Ollie
OL,17,FRathbone had no right to score from
OL,18,Fthe angle he did. As the ball came
OL,19,Fover his shoulder travelling away from
OL,20,Fgoal, he hooked his boot around it to
OL,21,Fvolley in from 10 yards.
