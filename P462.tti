OL,5,FLocal Pollen information for Wales
OL,7,FThe grass pollen season for Wales can
OL,8,Fvary quite a lot over a short
OL,9,Fdistance. Although generally it can be
OL,10,Fsevere in the south and towards the
OL,11,FWelsh-English border, elsewhere Wales
OL,12,Ftypically experiences a mild grass
OL,13,Fpollen.
OL,15,FLower Pollen Count AreasJThe wind
OL,16,Fdirection in the UK is predominantly
OL,17,Fsouthwesterly and therefore coastal
OL,18,Fareas are less susceptible high pollen

OL,9,Ftypically experience a mild grass

OL,13,FHigh Pollen Count AreasJThe growing

OL,5,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,6,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,7,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,8,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,9,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,10,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.
OL,12,FThe immune system normally defends the

OL,14,Fviruses and bacteria, to ward off
