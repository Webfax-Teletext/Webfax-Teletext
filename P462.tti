OL,6,FA North Wales church which has been
OL,7,Fwithout services for over a decade has
OL,8,Fbeen reopened by the Archbishop of
OL,9,FWales.
OL,11,FMany chapels and churches have closed
OL,12,Facross the country due to high costs
OL,13,FbutJSt Mary's Church in Morfa Nefyn is
OL,14,Fbucking the trend.
OL,16,FNo-one is quite sure exactly but
OL,17,Fsomewhere between 2,000 - 3,500
OL,18,Fchurches across Britain have locked
OL,19,Ftheir doors and left only a
OL,20,Fcongregation of spiders inside. St
OL,21,FMary's was on that list...until now.
