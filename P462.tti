OL,11,FBut Cardiff council says it's coming

OL,6,FA teacher from Ysgol Nant Caerau says
OL,7,Fthe cost of living crisis could be the

OL,11,F"For me, it's such an important thing.
OL,12,FSwimming is a life skill to have
OL,13,Fespecially for children and younger

OL,16,F"It's so important for them to develop
OL,17,Fthe basic skills for swimming. I know
