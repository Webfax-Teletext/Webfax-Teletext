OL,8,FUniversity Health Board has been
OL,9,Flabelled 'a disaster' by angry parents.
OL,11,FThe health board announced in December
OL,12,Fa review was needed "in order to
OL,13,Fmaintain the public confidence in the
OL,14,Fcare being delivered."
OL,16,FIt followed an ITV Wales This Week

OL,18,Fissues within the maternity unit at
OL,19,FSingleton Hospital and a Healthcare
OL,20,FInspectorate Wales report which found
OL,21,Fthe unit to be "unsafe".
