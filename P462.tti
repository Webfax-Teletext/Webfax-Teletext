OL,7,FToday, you can still see the eerie

OL,9,Fthoroughfares that once pulsated with
OL,10,Flife. They're echoes of a vibrant
OL,11,Fcommunity that was displaced during
OL,12,Fthe 1970s.
OL,14,FThe lower part of Splott, once flanked
OL,15,Fby heavy industry, was a traditional

OL,12,F"We were always looked after and we

OL,7,FGeoff Cook was born and brought up in

OL,9,Fgives him an enormous sense of pride.
OL,11,F"It's a generation lost now. What they
OL,12,Fhad down here years ago, nobody seems
OL,13,Fto have anymore," he said.
OL,15,F"You had street after street after
