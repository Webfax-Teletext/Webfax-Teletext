OL,6,FOnce, you'd have had no trouble
OL,7,Ffinding Pentre Berw station. You'd
OL,8,Fjust follow the smoke of the steam
OL,9,Fengine and the noise of the whistle.
OL,11,FBut nothing's whistled - or smouldered
OL,12,Faway in the platform there - for
OL,13,Fdecades.
OL,15,FIn fact, down a north Anglesey lane
OL,16,Fthat feels like you might be slightly
OL,17,Ftrespassing, you suddenly come to a
OL,18,Flong, low red and white brick building
OL,19,Fthat hasn't seen a single passenger
OL,20,Ffor maybe 70 years.

OL,6,FAs we wander from waiting room to

OL,9,Fdoesn't take much to imagine what this

OL,13,FSo, all those fireplaces - marble in
