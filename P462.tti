OL,6,FThere's not much that surprises me,
OL,7,Fhaving covered politics for as long as
OL,8,FI have, and yet, this week I found
OL,9,Fmyself both surprised and baffled.
OL,11,FI'd based myself in Westminster on
OL,12,FMonday because the sense of a crisis
OL,13,Funfolding around Sir Keir Starmer's
OL,14,Fleadership, triggered by the row over
OL,15,FPeter Mandelson's appointment as US
OL,16,Fambassador, had become abundantly
OL,17,Fclear.

OL,14,FShe didn't follow suit and in fact
OL,15,Fdidn't speak publicly on Monday at
