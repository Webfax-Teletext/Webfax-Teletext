OL,6,FVaughan Gething has said he "would
OL,7,Flike to see a change in approach" in
OL,8,Fthe way the Prime Minister deals with
OL,9,Fthe Welsh Government.
OL,11,FSpeaking on The News Agents podcast,
OL,12,FMr Gething reflected on the sometimes
OL,13,Fstrained relationship between the
OL,14,FFirst Minister of Wales and the Prime
