OL,7,FMr Drakeford's use of WhatsApp.
OL,9,FThat in itself is no surprise:
OL,10,FWhatsApp messages have been at the
OL,11,Fcentre of the inquiry and of political
OL,12,Fcriticism directed at Boris Johnson,
OL,13,FMatt Hancock, Nicola Sturgeon and

OL,16,FOn both occasions in the Senedd, Mr

OL,18,Fhe said, he had to respect the
OL,19,Finquiry. His refusal infuriated his

OL,8,Foccasions, one of which was to say

OL,11,FMr Drakeford portrayed himself as
OL,12,Fsomeone who is largely ignorant of

OL,12,F"I have no knowledge or expertise in
