OL,6,FProsecutor David Mainstone said that
OL,7,Fthe behaviour towards Ms Lloyd, who
OL,8,Fhas a range of health issues including
OL,9,Fosteoporosis, amounted to a
OL,10,F"disability hate crime."
OL,12,FIn court he detailed Ms Lloyd's ordeal
OL,13,Fsaying that on 16 August last year,
OL,14,FPennington of Glan yr Eglwys, was
OL,15,Foutside their home talking to a

OL,6,FMr Mainstone went onto say that

OL,11,FThe court heard how he was also said
OL,12,Fto become abusive after drinking and
OL,13,Fdid so on the evening of 16 August.
OL,14,FFearing something would happen Ms
OL,15,FLloyd began recording their

OL,18,FMr Mainstone said Pennington grabbed
OL,19,Fher hair and dragged her from room to
OL,20,Froom then slapped her and head-butted
OL,21,Fher above her left eye.

OL,11,FMs Lloyd was said to have been left
