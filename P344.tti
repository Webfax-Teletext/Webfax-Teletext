OL,5,GIf you have a newer Freeview Play TV or
OL,6,Gbox, you may have noticed something
OL,7,Gstrange happening to BBC Four on your
OL,8,Gchannel list.
OL,10,FSince last week, some receivers have
OL,11,Freplaced BBC Four SD on channel 9
OL,12,F(channel 24 in Scotland) with BBC Four
OL,13,FHD. The SD channel is now found on

OL,5,FUntil now, there's been a one size fits
OL,6,Fall channel numbering system in place
OL,7,Fon Freeview, applying to both HD and SD
OL,8,Fdevices. On Sky or Freesat, if you have
OL,9,Fan HD receiver, HD versions of channels
OL,10,Freplace SD versions. This hasn't
OL,11,Fhappened on Freeview.
OL,13,FAlongside the Freeview broadcast
OL,14,Fsignal, there's data telling TVs and
OL,15,Fset top boxes which channel number
OL,16,Fshould be assigned to each service  a
OL,17,Fso-called LCN, or logical channel
OL,18,Fnumber. Under this system, if an HD
OL,19,Fchannel was to swap places with a SD

OL,5,FUsing the above example of BBC Four,

OL,7,FFreeview box would suddenly move BBC

OL,10,Fof Ofcom channel prominence rules,
OL,11,Fwhich stipulates BBC Four should appear
OL,12,Fin the first 24 channel slots.
OL,14,FCLM gets around this by delivering an
