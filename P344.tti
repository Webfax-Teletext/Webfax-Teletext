OL,4,FWith seconds to go before the end of
OL,5,Ftoday's BBC News Special on BBC One,
OL,6,Fpolitical editor Chris Mason is asked
OL,7,Fwho he thinks might get the foreign
OL,8,Fsecretary job in newly appointed Prime
OL,9,FMinister Rishi Sunak's new cabinet.
OL,11,FChris obviously wants to provide a full
OL,12,Fanswer but presenter Huw Edwards is
OL,13,Fhearing the countdown to the close of
OL,14,Fthe programme in his ear.
OL,16,FAnd just when Huw thinks he's home and
OL,17,Fdry, Chris throws in an "or"  leading
OL,18,Fon to an alternative suggestion for the
OL,19,Fforeign post.

OL,6,Fto her director and producer.
OL,8,FShe then walked the short distance to
OL,9,Fthe door leading into the main studio.
OL,10,FHowever, the door was firmly shut, with
OL,11,Fwarning notices banning unauthorised
OL,12,Fpersonnel, mobile phones and cameras.
OL,14,FWhy? Well, a new set is currently under
OL,15,Fconstruction in the main studio. The
OL,16,Fprogramme is currently based in a small
