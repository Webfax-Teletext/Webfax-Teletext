OL,8,Fproject to save London's "charming
OL,9,Flittle" hairy snail.
OL,11,FNamed the German hairy snail because
OL,12,Fof tiny hairs that cover its shell,
OL,13,Fthe rare species is one of the UK's
OL,14,Fmost endangered molluscs.
OL,16,FThe finger-sized animal can be found
OL,17,Fonly in small, fragmented patches of
OL,18,Fits historic damp riverside habitat
