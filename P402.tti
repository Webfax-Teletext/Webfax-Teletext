OL,6,FThompson has, almost unwittingly,
OL,7,Fplayed a major part in Murray's recent
OL,8,Fhistory at the west London tournament.
OL,10,FIt was in 2017 when Murray, then world
OL,11,Fnumber one and defending the last of
OL,12,Fhis five titles at Queen's, was beaten
OL,13,Fby lucky loser Thompson as the hip
OL,14,Fproblems which would eventually
OL,15,Frequire drastic surgery were really
OL,16,Fbeginning to bite.

OL,6,F"I could see he had a problem in the
OL,7,Fwarm-up and then his first serve,"
OL,8,Fsaid Thompson.
OL,10,F"I thought, 'hit the ball in and make
OL,11,Fhim run'. I actually learned that from
OL,12,Fhim, when he was playing, and if a guy
OL,13,Fwas hurt or cramping or something,
OL,14,Fhe'd always use a drop shot or just
OL,15,Ftry and take it up the line.
OL,17,F"I thought. 'I just need to make him

OL,19,Fme being a lot younger than him and
OL,20,Fwatching him play.
