OL,9,Fhelp.
OL,11,F"He used to play on the green out on

OL,13,Fof the young ones was hurt, he'd be
OL,14,Fthe first that would go to their aid."

OL,6,FMs Gilbert said: "There was so much
OL,7,Foverlap in terms of both the
OL,8,Fpsychology of the characters in my
OL,9,Fstory, but also the details of how
OL,10,FPeter (Lee's dad) had continued to
OL,11,Fsearch for his son...and I was stunned

OL,15,FOne event that features in the movie
OL,16,Fis something that happened to Mr
OL,17,FBoxell when somebody told him that his

OL,20,Flooked similar it wasn't him.
