OL,7,Frefused annual leave and heard his

OL,11,Fthe claimant as "this shit" and "this
OL,12,Fslave", the tribunal was told.
OL,14,FTribunal judge Paul Abbott found that
OL,15,FMr Ravichandran was "upset and
OL,16,Fhumiliated" and that the refusal of
OL,17,Fthe claimant's leave request was
OL,18,F"significantly influenced" by his race.
