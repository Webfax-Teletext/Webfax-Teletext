OL,6,FOn Wednesday, the panel of five
OL,7,Fjustices found there was "ample
OL,8,Fevidence" for a jury to convict the
OL,9,Ftwo men had it been properly directed,
OL,10,Fbut they had not.
OL,12,FIn an 82-page judgment, with which
OL,13,FSupreme Court president Lord Reed,
OL,14,FLords Hodge and Lloyd-Jones and Lady
OL,15,FSimler agreed, Lord Leggatt said:
OL,16,F"That misdirection undermined the
OL,17,Ffairness of the trial."
OL,19,FThe jury direction errors made both
OL,20,Fconvictions unsafe, Lord Leggatt said.
