OL,7,Fponds or lakes is extremely dangerous.
OL,8,FNever assume that the ice is thick
OL,9,Fenough to support you. It may look
OL,10,Fsturdy enough to stand on, but it
OL,11,Foften isn't and can be of variable
OL,12,Fthickness especially as you move away
OL,13,Ffrom the edge where the ice is often
OL,14,Fthinner. If you fall into icy water,
OL,15,Fthe risk of hypothermia is very high
