OL,6,FThe defence responded: "Whilst welcome
OL,7,Fnews, this defendant spent 16 months
OL,8,Fon remand. When granted bail the PPS
OL,9,Fappealed to ensure he remained in

OL,12,Fit was under extremely strenuous

OL,15,FHe continued: "I am sure he is
OL,16,Fdelighted as he has been removed from
OL,17,Fhis family and community. Today was
OL,18,Fhis 55th court appearance and it's
OL,19,Ffrankly astonishing the case is only
OL,20,Fnow withdrawn at this very late stage."
