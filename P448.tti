OL,6,FThe community of east Belfast came
OL,7,Ftogether on Wednesday to condemn a
OL,8,Fracist attack on a church.
OL,10,FThe DUP leader and MP for the area
OL,11,FGavin Robinson told UTV there could
OL,12,Fnever be a justification for violence.
OL,14,F"It is not justified today just

OL,16,Fme," he said.
OL,18,FThe East Belfast Churches Network also
OL,19,Fcondemned the attack.
