OL,6,FThe chairman of the Police Federation
OL,7,Ffor Northern Ireland has called on the
OL,8,FUK Government and the Stormont
OL,9,FExecutive to end their "shameful,
OL,10,Fpenny-pinching betrayal of policing".
OL,12,FLiam Kelly, in his address to the
OL,13,Ffederation's annual conference in Co
OL,14,FAntrim, said the PSNI is in the
OL,15,Fdeepest resourcing crisis since its

OL,18,Funless there is urgent intervention.
