OL,3,C'An insult': Sean Brown's family on
OL,4,CGovernment taking legal action
OL,6,FThe family of Sean Brown has said it
OL,7,Fis an "insult" that the Government is
OL,8,Ftaking legal action relating to the
OL,9,Finquest into his death.
OL,11,FThe move will effectively delay a
OL,12,Fdecision on whether to grant a public
OL,13,Finquiry into the GAA official's
OL,14,Fmurder.JMr Brown, who was 61, was
OL,15,Fabducted in Bellaghy in Co Londonderry
OL,16,Fand was shot near Randalstown in 1997.
OL,18,FHis daughter Siobhan Brown said the
OL,19,Ffamily is still coming to terms with
OL,20,Fthe development.

OL,9,Finquest. They did not state the

OL,12,F"It would be inappropriate to comment

OL,17,FIt is understood, however, the nature
OL,18,Fof the action centres on the partial
OL,19,Frelease of sensitive information
