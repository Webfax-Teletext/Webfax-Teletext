OL,9,Fan Asian hornet in Northern Ireland
OL,10,Ffor the first time.
OL,12,FIt was captured in Dundonald on Friday
OL,13,F10 October, and while the insect poses
OL,14,Fno more of a threat to humans than a
OL,15,Fnormal wasp or bee, it can have a

OL,7,FEntomologist Paul Moore said the

OL,7,F"Therefore they're very easy prey, but

OL,9,Fissue. It's a whole range of other
OL,10,Fpollinators. Hoverflies, wasps are all

OL,12,Fbees are a big big stationary colony
OL,13,Fand therefore it's an easy meal for

OL,16,F"It's a big problem for beekeepers who
