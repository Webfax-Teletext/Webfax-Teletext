OL,6,FThe brake is a mechanism that allows a
OL,7,Fminimum of 30 Stormont MLAs, from at
OL,8,Fleast two parties, to refer a proposed
OL,9,Flaw change to the UK Government.
OL,11,FThe government then makes an
OL,12,Fassessment of the proposed change on
OL,13,FNorthern Ireland and can ultimately
OL,14,Fveto its application in the region.
OL,16,FThe process is a potentially lengthy
OL,17,Fone and, if the government believes
OL,18,Fthe brake has been appropriately
OL,19,Fpulled, will involve direct engagement
OL,20,Fwith the EU to find a solution.
