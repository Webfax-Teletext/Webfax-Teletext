OL,6,FDesperate to avoid dialysis, Bev
OL,7,Fturned to social media, in a desperate

OL,9,Fkidney to her.
OL,11,FThe 65-year-old grandmother said: "I
OL,12,Fdidn't focus on the disease I focused
OL,13,Fon life. There were very few people
OL,14,Fknew about it so I just thought if I
OL,15,Fdon't tell anybody nobody can help me
OL,16,Fso I penned an appeal."

OL,6,FIn a remarkable twist, one person who
OL,7,Fcame forward was no stranger but in
OL,8,Ffact long lost friend Lisa Chapman who
OL,9,FBev had not seen for more than 20
OL,10,Fyears.
OL,12,FTwelve volunteers who replied to the

OL,14,FLisa was the best match.
OL,16,FThe 49-year-old said: "I just feel

OL,6,FShe said:"I didn't realise you could

OL,8,Fwere still alive so it's raising that

OL,10,Fstill have a healthy life yourself."
OL,12,FBev said one of the best things to
