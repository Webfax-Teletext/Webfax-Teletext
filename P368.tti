OL,6,FIn October 2023, an RSPCA Inspector
OL,7,Fattended Russel's property following

OL,9,Fleft for over a week with no food or
OL,10,Fwater.
OL,12,FKnowing they had potentially no access
OL,13,Fto food and water for over a week,
OL,14,Fthey immediately called for police to
OL,15,Fattend and support with the removal of

OL,6,FPrior to officers' arrival, Russel
OL,7,Freturned to the property and gave a

OL,9,Fwere near to death. These excuses
OL,10,Fcontinued during her interview with
OL,11,Fofficers, stating she had 'been in
OL,12,Fhospital', 'had a paid a dog sitter
OL,13,Fwho failed to care for the animals',
OL,14,F'left the tap running 24/7 for the
OL,15,Fanimals' and 'fed them three times a
