OL,13,FRotterdam in Holland when the tragedy

OL,16,FOnce he became aware of the Stena

OL,6,FWhen the Solong reached one nautical
OL,7,Fmile from the oil tanker, Motin said
OL,8,Fhe took the decision to take it out of
OL,9,Fautopilot and steer 15 degrees.
OL,11,FAsked if he looked at the button when
OL,12,Fhe switched to manual, Motin said:
OL,13,F"Literally, I done it more than 1,000
OL,14,Ftimes. In reality you don't look to
OL,15,Fthe button when you press it."
OL,17,FMotin told jurors he then rotated the
OL,18,Fwheel starboard by 20 degrees. When
OL,19,Fnothing happened after five seconds,
OL,20,Fhe increased the rudder angle to no
