OL,3,CWorld Bee Day: Celebrating the all-
OL,4,Cimportant pollinators
OL,6,F'World Bee Day' is celebrated on 20
OL,7,FMay each year, and aims to acknowledge
OL,8,Fthe role that bees - and other
OL,9,Fpollinators - play in our ecosystem.
OL,11,FOne third of the UK bee population has
OL,12,Fdeclined in the last 10 years. The
OL,13,Fmain causes are loss of habitat for
OL,14,Fnesting and foraging, climate change
OL,15,Fand the use of chemical pesticides.
OL,17,FThe easiest way we can help our bees
OL,18,Fthrive is by planting bee friendly,
OL,19,Fnative plants in our gardens that
OL,20,Fflower at different times of the year.

OL,6,FAsking local public spaces to plant

OL,8,Fverges alone will also encourage, and

OL,11,FBees Feed Us
OL,13,FAlmost 90% of wild plants and 75% of
OL,14,Fleading global crops depend on animal
OL,15,Fpollination. 1 of every 3 mouthfuls of
OL,16,Four food depends on pollinators such
OL,17,Fas bees.

OL,6,FThe best thing to do if you see a bee
OL,7,Fstruggling is gently put it onto a bee-
OL,8,Ffriendly flower. If there are no bee-
OL,9,Ffriendly flowers around, mix 50/50
OL,10,Fwhite sugar and water to give the
OL,11,Fbumblebee a one-off energy boost,

OL,6,FOnly female bees can sting. Male bees
OL,7,Fdon't have the anatomy to do so. And -
OL,8,Funlike the more aggressive relation,
OL,9,Fthe wasp (yellow jacket) - bees rarely
OL,10,Fsting...only when they feel
OL,11,Fthreatened. It is only the honey bee
OL,12,Fthat will die after stinging, not the
OL,13,Fbumble bee!
OL,15,FThey're Speedy!
OL,17,FWorker bees can reach a speed of 15-20
OL,18,Fmph when flying to a food source, and
OL,19,Fabout 12 mph when returning laden down
OL,20,Fwith nectar, pollen, propolis or water.
