OL,5,FThe future of a former RAF base in
OL,6,FLincolnshire is once again under the
OL,7,Fspotlight after the government dropped
OL,8,Fplans to house asylum seekers on the
OL,9,Fsite.
OL,11,FThe disused RAF Scampton had been
OL,12,Fearmarked by the last Conservative
OL,13,Fgovernment as a reception centre for
OL,14,Fup to 2,000 migrants at any one time.
OL,16,FBut Labour announced on Thursday that
OL,17,Fthey would follow through on an
OL,18,Felection pledge to ditch the proposals.
