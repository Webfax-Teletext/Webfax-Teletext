OL,6,FDet Con Scott Jarvis, of South
OL,7,FYorkshire Police, said: "Stubbs
OL,8,Fbetrayed the trust given to her as
OL,9,Fsomeone employed to work within one of
OL,10,Four prisons. She desperately tried to
OL,11,Fcover her tracks but her story just
OL,12,Fdidn't add up and a thorough
OL,13,Finvestigation led to the truth being
OL,14,Frevealed.
OL,16,F"The conveyance of any prohibited
OL,17,Farticle into prisons poses a serious
OL,18,Frisk to both staff and prisoners, and
OL,19,Fcan trigger instances of violence and
OL,20,Fdisorder.
