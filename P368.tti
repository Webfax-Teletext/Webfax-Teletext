OL,6,FBut senior coroner Joanne Kearsley,
OL,7,Fwho ruled he died from suicide, has
OL,8,Fraised concerns about the case in a
OL,9,Fprevention of future deaths report.
OL,11,FShe said Mr Abraham had expressed
OL,12,Fsuicidal thoughts to a counsellor in
OL,13,FOctober 2022, but the information was
OL,14,Fnot shared with the force. He later
OL,15,Ftold a sergeant he was considering
OL,16,Fending his life, prompting an email
