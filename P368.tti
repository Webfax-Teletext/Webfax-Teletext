OL,7,FKemi Badenoch is only too aware of the
OL,8,Flong shadow that Margaret Thatcher
OL,9,Fcontinues to cast over the
OL,10,FConservative Party - even 35 years
OL,11,Fafter she left Downing Street for the

OL,14,FCardboard cutouts of the country's

OL,17,FManchester earlier this month.
OL,19,FHer name is revered among many of the

OL,11,FOn what would have been Thatcher's

OL,15,FShe was shown the wooden honours board

OL,17,FMargaret Roberts; a plaque
OL,18,Fcommemorating her attendance at the

OL,7,FOver the weekend, Doncaster born

OL,10,FDoncaster North MP Ed Miliband at the

OL,13,FHe posted on X: "People of Doncaster
OL,14,FNorth. Are you happy with your MP?
OL,15,FWould you like it if someone from your
OL,16,Fneck of the woods kicked him out?"
OL,18,FClarkson has made similar suggestions

OL,20,Fparty he would run for, if he planned
OL,21,Fto contest the seat.

OL,16,FBut for many Thatcher's legacy is
