OL,6,FJeremy Evans, prosecuting, said that
OL,7,Fthe victim had begun a relationship
OL,8,Fwith the woman only a few days before
OL,9,Fthe incident in September last year.
OL,11,FHe said Blanshard and the woman had
OL,12,Fsplit up about 14 months before the
OL,13,Fattack, although they briefly reunited
OL,14,Fabout a month before the incident.
OL,15,FThey finally ended their relationship
OL,16,Fafter a violent confrontation between
OL,17,Fthem.JMr Evans said messages sent
OL,18,Fbetween the woman and Blanshard
OL,19,Fbetween September 4-8 showed that the
OL,20,Fbreak-up of their "toxic" relationship
OL,21,Fwas the motive behind the attack.
