OL,8,FYorkshire man who spent over a year
OL,9,Ftrekking nearly 9,000 miles around the
OL,10,Fcoast of Great Britain.
OL,12,FThe Navy veteran took on the challenge
OL,13,Fto raise money for the Gurkhas - who
OL,14,Fhe worked alongside.
OL,16,FNow he's back and planning to walk the
OL,17,Flength of Normandy's D Day Beaches-
OL,18,F where his father served 80 years ago.

OL,6,FJim, from Penistone, walked the length
OL,7,Fof the British Coastline in September
OL,8,F2022. It took him 537 days to complete.
OL,10,FBut he's not ready to hang up his
OL,11,Fboots just yet.
OL,13,FHis next challenge will see him walk
OL,14,Fthe length of Normandy's D Day Beaches
OL,15,Ffrom Utah to Sword- where his father
OL,16,Fserved 80 years ago.
OL,18,F"When you look at the photos of him,
OL,19,Fhe was 21, but he only looked about 12
OL,20,Fto be honest on some of the pictures.
OL,21,FIt must have been terrifying for him."

OL,6,FLike his father Jim also spent time in
OL,7,Fthe navy- serving alongside many
OL,8,FGurkhas on HMS Gurkha.
OL,10,FHis walk and the proceeds of his book
OL,11,Fhave raised over #40,000 for the
OL,12,FGurkha Welfare Trust.
OL,14,FBut he hopes this next challenge will
OL,15,Fhelp him to reach his #50,000 target.
OL,17,F"The Gurkas fought for us for over 200
