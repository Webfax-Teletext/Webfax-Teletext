OL,8,Fof delays caused by leaves on the line.
OL,10,FEast Midlands Railway said that in
OL,11,Fautumn leaves can make the rails
OL,12,Fslippery and has therefore reduced the
OL,13,Fnumber of trains which stop at
OL,14,FSwinderby, Lincolnshire.
OL,16,FThe change is being implemented from
OL,17,FMonday 28 October to Saturday 30

OL,6,FA spokesperson for East Midlands
OL,7,FRailway said the measure is in a bid
OL,8,Fto improve the overall performance of
OL,9,Fthe Nottingham - Lincoln route in the
OL,10,Fautumn.
OL,12,FThey said: "During Autumn, low
OL,13,Fadhesion caused by leaf fall can make
OL,14,Frails slippery and harder for trains
OL,15,Fto accelerate and brake effectively.
OL,17,F"Safety is our top priority, so when
OL,18,Fthis happens, drivers have to pull out
OL,19,Fof stations more slowly and brake much
OL,20,Fearlier for stations and signals to
OL,21,Fmake sure they stop in time."
