OL,6,FA meeting was being held at County
OL,7,FHall to approve Wakefield Council's
OL,8,Fbudget for 2024 to 2025 which included
OL,9,Fincreasing council tax by almost 5%.
OL,10,FIt was briefly adjourned by Mayor of
OL,11,FWakefield Cllr Josie Pritchard
OL,12,Ffollowing the comment by Independent
OL,13,FCllr Akef Akbar, who had previously
OL,14,Fdisagreed with the council tax
OL,15,Fincrease.JCllr Akbar had earlier said:
OL,16,F"Can somebody tell me why the taxpayer
OL,17,Fshould pick up the bill for your
OL,18,Fincompetence and your mistakes?J"We
OL,19,Fshould pull our fingers out and be
OL,20,Fmore efficient."JBut Cllr Akbar made
OL,21,Fthe controversial "scum" remark while
OL,22,Fraising a point of order when Labour's
OL,23,FGeorge Ayre spoke against a
OL,24,Fsuggestions of a council tax freeze.
