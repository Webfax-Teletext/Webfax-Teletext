OL,6,FSgt Mark Patterson, who pulled Smith

OL,8,Fwasn't the cleverest place to hide on
OL,9,Fa cold November night and he could
OL,10,Fhave caused himself serious harm.
OL,12,F"Smith was arrested and we immediately
OL,13,Fgave him first aid to help him warm up
OL,14,Fwhile an ambulance was called.
OL,16,F"He was shivering, so we wrapped him
OL,17,Fin a foil blanket and gave him one of
OL,18,Four woolly police hats to wear, and a
OL,19,Fthick winter police coat."
