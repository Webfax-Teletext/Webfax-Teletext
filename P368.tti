OL,10,FIt's just a couple of weeks since the

OL,15,FYorkshire is home to the Prime

OL,17,F- as well as a number of key bricks in

OL,20,FSo, could Yorkshire decide the result

OL,6,FYou'll hear a lot of talk about the

OL,9,FIn 2019, the Tories took 14 seats from

OL,13,FOf course, Labour will be desperate to

OL,15,FRother Valley and Penistone and
