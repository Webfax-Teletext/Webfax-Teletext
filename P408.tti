OL,6,FHorse behaviour expert Suzanne Rogers
OL,7,Fsaid: "I've seen lots of similar

OL,9,Ftrained but they are made to stand in
OL,10,Fa small area for long periods of time.
OL,12,F"So it might not be what the tourists
OL,13,Fthemselves did - it might be the
OL,14,Fresult of a lot of triggers.
OL,16,F"It's interesting because there's a
OL,17,Fsign directly next to the horse that
OL,18,Fsays the horses may bite or kick and
OL,19,F'please don't touch the reins'.
