OL,6,FMayor of London Sadiq Khan has pledged
OL,7,Fnot to expand the ultra low emission
OL,8,Fzone (Ulez) scheme if he returns to
OL,9,Fthe role after May's election.
OL,11,FIn a letter to London's transport
OL,12,Fcommissioner Andy Lord, Mr Khan wrote
OL,13,Fthat he had "categorically" ruled out
OL,14,Fthe introduction of a pay-per-mile
OL,15,Fscheme as well as any tightening of
OL,16,FUlez emissions standards.
OL,18,FHe wrote: "There is clearly still more
OL,19,Fto do to tackle air pollution, and I'm
OL,20,Fdetermined to continue leading from
OL,21,Fthe front in London.
