OL,6,FThe grey shed, which houses the

OL,10,FSpeaking to ITV News London, Mr Kemp
OL,11,Fsaid: "I came back from holiday in mid-
OL,12,FJuly and noticed there was a temporary
OL,13,Fstructure outside my other property. I
OL,14,Fdidn't think anything of it, as just
OL,15,Fthought it was a temporary structure.
OL,17,F"After a couple of weeks, it was still
OL,18,Fthere, so I parked up and viewed the
OL,19,Foutbuilding. This did not look
OL,20,Ftemporary as there is a concrete base.

OL,6,F"I then took a couple of weeks to try

OL,17,FMr Kemp told ITV News that TfL did not

OL,19,Ftoilet was going to be erected. He
OL,20,Fmade a formal complaint in August.
