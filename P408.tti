OL,6,FThe Commissioner for the Metropolitan
OL,7,FPolice has said violence against women
OL,8,Fand girls (VAWG) is "endemic, systemic
OL,9,Fand a threat to society on the same

OL,12,FSir Mark Rowley spoke out after a
OL,13,Freport published by the National
OL,14,FPolice Chiefs' Council and National
