OL,6,FLocal farmers and wine makers have
OL,7,Fsaid the heavy rain this autumn is
OL,8,Faffecting their crops and livestock
OL,9,Fand having an impact on their
OL,10,Fbusinesses.
OL,12,FAndrew Woollatt, who runs Hedges Farm
OL,13,Fin St Albans, told ITV News he has
OL,14,Frarely seen weather like it - and
OL,15,Ffields normally full of cows are
OL,16,Finstead under water.
OL,18,FHertfordshire saw its wettest
OL,19,FSeptember on record this year, with

OL,6,FMr Woollatt said his fields had fallen
OL,7,Fvictim to 'poaching', the process in
OL,8,Fwhich meadows are destroyed by the
OL,9,Fcattle churning up the wet ground.
OL,11,FIt means there's less grass for his
OL,12,Fcows to graze on and the planting of
OL,13,Fseeds for animal feed has had to be
OL,14,Fpushed back.
OL,16,FAll of this costs money, with cows
OL,17,Fneeding supplements in their diets and
OL,18,Fcrops likely to produce smaller yields.

OL,6,FMr Woollatt said he will have to
OL,7,Fabsorb the cost, but the National
OL,8,FFarmer's Union says the weather could
OL,9,Fend up hitting consumers.
OL,11,FThe NFU's Director of Strategy Nick
OL,12,FVon Westenholz said: "All of this can
OL,13,Fbe the difference for a farmer between
OL,14,Fhaving a profitable year and having a
OL,15,Fyear where he's making a loss.
OL,17,F"But there will be a knock on for the
OL,18,Fconsumer as well because ultimately
OL,19,Fthis means fewer crops being produced
OL,20,Fand less feed for livestock and that
OL,21,Fall puts pressure in the market place."

OL,6,FChief executive Christopher White told

OL,8,Fharvest you need the maximum amount of
OL,9,Fsunshine ... when you have cloud cover
OL,10,Fand rain they slow down the sugars and
OL,11,Fthe photosynthesis slows down.
OL,13,F"We need a bit of dry weather to make
OL,14,Fsure that the volume in it, the sugars
OL,15,Fare correct, the acidity is correct
OL,16,Fand the flavours are all there."
OL,18,F2023 was a bumper year for the estate,
OL,19,Fbut Mr White said he expects the
OL,20,Fvolume of its yield this year to be
OL,21,Fdown by around 30 per cent.
