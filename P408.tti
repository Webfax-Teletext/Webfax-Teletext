OL,7,FGovernment of "curtailing the UK's
OL,8,Fglobal connectivity".
OL,10,FThe west London airport criticised
OL,11,Fmeasures such as introducing a #10 fee
OL,12,Ffor some transiting passengers and the
OL,13,Frefusal to resume tax-free shopping
OL,14,Ffor international visitors.
OL,16,FThe Government launched the electronic

OL,19,Ftransiting through the UK without
