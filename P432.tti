OL,6,FThe end of the net was full of sand,
OL,7,Fmud and fish. Once it was lifted out
OL,8,Fthe water, it swung away from vessel's
OL,9,Fside causing it to capsize.
OL,11,FThe skipper did not have time to raise
OL,12,Fthe alarm before entering the water.
OL,14,FHowever they were wearing a lifejacket

OL,16,Fand managed to swim to the vessel's
