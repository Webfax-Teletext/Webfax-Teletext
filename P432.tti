OL,6,FA scientist has warned people to stay
OL,7,Faway from "unstable cliffs" after a
OL,8,Fmajor cliff fall at a Devon beach.
OL,10,FThe collapse happened at Jacob's
OL,11,FLadder beach, in Sidmouth at around
OL,12,F2pm on Sunday 17 March.
OL,14,FVicky Walkley, a coastal scientist
OL,15,Ffrom Exmouth, was sitting on a bench
OL,16,Flooking out to sea when the cliff
OL,17,Fstarted to fall and managed to capture
OL,18,Fit on video.

OL,6,FShe said: "I was enjoying a view of
OL,7,Fthe coast when I heard a big rumble
OL,8,Fand saw a huge section of the cliff
OL,9,Fcollapse.
OL,11,F"The rocks and debris entirely covered
OL,12,Fthe full width of the beach in
OL,13,Fseconds, which really highlights how
OL,14,Fdangerous it is to walk next to
OL,15,Funstable cliffs like these."
OL,17,FShe said debris continued to fall from
OL,18,Fthe cliffs even after the main cliff
OL,19,Fcollapse had stopped, and warned there
OL,20,Fcould have been "tragic" consequences
OL,21,Ffor passers-by.

OL,6,F"All the heavy rainfall we've had this
OL,7,Fwinter acts to lubricate the joints in

OL,11,F"Warm sunshine can also heat the rock,
