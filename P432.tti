OL,10,FMost of the group have been here for

OL,13,FUri said: "What I was most surprised
OL,14,Fabout was there were so many planes
OL,15,Fflying around.
OL,17,F"When the war started in Ukraine there
OL,18,Fwere no planes because the air was
OL,19,Fclosed and then when I came here I was

OL,21,Fit was a common thing, just unusual."

OL,10,FEveryone said they found it "scary"
OL,11,Fwhen they arrived because of the
