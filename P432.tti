OL,6,FAround 5,000 eggs from a variety of
OL,7,Fbirds were seized. No arrests have

OL,9,Fcontinuing.
OL,11,FThe Gloucestershire investigation was
OL,12,Fled by the force's rural crime team.
OL,14,FPC Cath McDay said: "Birds, their eggs
OL,15,Fand their nests are protected under
OL,16,Fnumerous pieces of legislation.
OL,18,F"Unfortunately, some people still like
OL,19,Fto collect eggs. When those eggs are
OL,20,Ftaken, those birds are no longer in
OL,21,Fthe wild and are no longer breeding.
