OL,6,FWhat is china clay and how is it mined?
OL,8,FChina clay is a material known as
OL,9,Fkaolin, which was first used in China
OL,10,Fmore than 10 thousand years ago to
OL,11,Fmake fine white porcelain. Some of
OL,12,Fthis eventually made its way to Europe.
OL,14,FNoticing a gap in the market, a
OL,15,FPlymouth apothecary began to research
OL,16,Fthe porcelain-making process and spent
OL,17,Fseveral years searching for a material
OL,18,Fthat resembled kaolin. In 1745 he
OL,19,Ffound it, at Tregonning Hill in
OL,20,FCornwall.

OL,6,FBy the mid 19th century 65,000 tonnes
OL,7,Fof china clay were being mined from
OL,8,Fthe St Austell area every year by
OL,9,F7,000 workers.
OL,11,FKaolin is traditionally extracted from
OL,12,Fmines using a hydraulic mining method.
OL,13,FThis is a wet process where high
OL,14,Fpressure water washes the clay from
OL,15,Fthe granite - forming a slurry to
OL,16,Ftransport it via pipes to a drying
OL,17,Fsite.
