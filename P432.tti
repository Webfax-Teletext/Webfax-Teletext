OL,10,Finside.
OL,12,F"We got it onto the edge of a slate

OL,15,Fand saw it was among the most

OL,6,FThe Brazilian yellow scorpion, or
OL,7,FTityus serrulatus , carries a venom
OL,8,Fwhich is extremely toxic, and is the
OL,9,Fmost dangerous scorpion in South
OL,10,FAmerica and responsible for the most
OL,11,Fdeaths from stings.
OL,13,FOne of the other roofers, Ben's
OL,14,Fbrother Jamie, said the scorpion had
OL,15,Fsurvived a long sea journey from
OL,16,FBrazil to the UK before emerging in
OL,17,FPlymouth.

OL,6,FHe said: "They are very common in
OL,7,FBrazil and can go without food for
OL,8,Fmonths, that is how it survived for
OL,9,Fall this time. It's probably been
OL,10,Fsitting in a merchants for a while

OL,13,FThe scorpion is now safely being
OL,14,Flooked after at Plymouth Reptile and
OL,15,FAquatic, in Cattedown.
OL,17,FJamie said: "They said it needed a bit
OL,18,Fof heat on it right away. We'll all go
OL,19,Fand see it in a few days."
