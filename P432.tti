OL,8,FFinley hasn't had a single seizure.
OL,9,FHis 'incurable' condition appears to
OL,10,Fhave been cured.
OL,12,F"It's absolutely amazing," said
OL,13,FFinley's mother, Sarah. "When we first
OL,14,Fstarted out, we never thought he would
OL,15,Fbe seizure-free. We thought that was
OL,16,Four life now."
OL,18,FBristol Children's Hospital is one of
