OL,6,F"My hedge is destroyed." That was the
OL,7,Fmessage I received from my neighbour
OL,8,Fwhen she got back from her holiday.
OL,10,FShe was referring to the destruction
OL,11,Fof her box hedge, or 'Buxus
OL,12,Fsempervirens,' a favourite in many
OL,13,Fgardens, often seen as neatly trimmed
OL,14,Fballs or pyramids. They're also
OL,15,Fsynonymous with big country houses in
OL,16,Fswathes of clipped topiary.
OL,18,FHowever, even the large estates and
OL,19,Ftheir gardening teams are suffering
OL,20,Fthe same fate as my friend. But who or
OL,21,Fwhat is responsible...

OL,17,F"It seems that the caterpillars are
