OL,8,Fthousands of people will be navigating
OL,9,FWorthy Farm's stages to see their
OL,10,Fbucket list acts.
OL,12,FBut for those looking to find a quiet
OL,13,Fmoment amidst all the noise, a new
OL,14,Fsensory space has been introduced, to
OL,15,Fgive festivalgoers a chance to unwind.
OL,17,FIt was created by Bristol charity
OL,18,FDiverse UK, and was built with people
OL,19,Fliving with ADHD, autism, and those
OL,20,Fstruggling with their mental health
OL,21,Fespecially in mind.

OL,15,FDiverse UK's Harry Jones says one tent

OL,6,FShe told ITV News West Country: "This
OL,7,Fkind of provision is vital. It's a
OL,8,Freasonable adjustment that needs to be
OL,9,Fnormalised because we live in a very
OL,10,Fstressful world - especially post-
OL,11,FCovid.
OL,13,F"People who identify as being disabled
OL,14,Fin various ways have a lot more of a
OL,15,Fvoice and are able to say these are
OL,16,Fthe things that they need.
OL,18,F"It's perfectly reasonable to ask for
OL,19,Fsome respite when things are too much.
