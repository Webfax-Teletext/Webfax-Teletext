OL,6,FAn increasing number of injured
OL,7,Fdolphins have been found around the
OL,8,FCornish coast, prompting a warning
OL,9,Ffrom the Cornwall Wildlife Trust.
OL,11,FThe mammals have been found primarily
OL,12,Fwith injured dorsal fins, likely to be
OL,13,Fthe result of propellors from high-
OL,14,Fspeed boats. A number of mammals have
OL,15,Fbeen found in a "severe" condition,
OL,16,Ftheir fins missing entirely.
OL,18,FThe trust is urging all water users to
OL,19,Fslow down and follow the marine and
OL,20,Fcoastal code.

OL,6,F"A couple of them even had their
OL,7,Fdorsal fin missing entirely. That is
OL,8,Fobviously not a great thing for
OL,9,Fdolphins because they use those dorsal
OL,10,Ffins for balance, and to help them
OL,11,Fkind of swim through the water, so it
OL,12,Fwill be impacting how they're living
OL,13,Ftheir lives and it will be adding
OL,14,Fstress to how they live their lives.
OL,16,F"We can't say for sure how they're
OL,17,Fdoing exactly. We do hope that they
OL,18,Fwill be doing all right, but it can
OL,19,Faffect their survivability as well."
