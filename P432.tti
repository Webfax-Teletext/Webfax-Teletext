OL,6,FDan Trevelyan, Senior Bird Keeper at
OL,7,FNewquay Zoo, said: "Windy was paired
OL,8,Fup with male penguin, Jet, for a long
OL,9,Ftime, and produced more than 20 chicks
OL,10,Ftogether. When Windy lost her partner,
OL,11,Fwe didn't necessarily expect her to
OL,12,Fpair up with another penguin, but
OL,13,FNacho started courting Windy last
OL,14,Fyear, and the two have been devoted to
OL,15,Feach other ever since.
OL,17,F"They had a clutch of eggs last
OL,18,Fspring, but neither of them were
OL,19,Fsuccessful, so we are really happy
OL,20,Fthat the pair have had a healthy chick
OL,21,Fthis breeding season."
