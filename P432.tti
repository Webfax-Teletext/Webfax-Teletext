OL,6,Fin recent years, , during the drier,

OL,9,FMr Lott said: "When fires take hold
OL,10,Fover an extensive area, they're
OL,11,Fheavily resource intensive and they're
OL,12,Falso incredibly dangerous.
OL,14,F"They're dangerous to the public,
OL,15,Fdangerous to livestock, dangerous to
OL,16,Fthe environment and biodiversity, and
OL,17,Fthey're also dangerous to the
OL,18,Ffirefighters who are responding in
OL,19,Forder to fight them and get them under
OL,20,Fcontrol."

OL,6,FMr Lott added that wildfires can also
OL,7,Fhave a devastating impact on the
OL,8,Fenvironment's biodiversity.
OL,10,FTony Whitehead, RSPB Communications
OL,11,FManager, said many people don't
OL,12,Frealise that some species of birds
OL,13,Fnest on or close to the ground.
OL,15,F"You've got to think of heathers as
OL,16,Fbeing like mini forests," he
OL,17,Fexplained. "So the birds will be
OL,18,Fnesting in amongst the heaths at
OL,19,Fground level."

OL,6,FHe added that some animals, such as
OL,7,Freptiles, cannot always escape the
OL,8,Ffires.
OL,10,F"In a place like this, you've got
OL,11,Fcommon lizards, you've got grass
OL,12,Fsnakes and adders, and sometimes the
OL,13,Ffirest move really quickly, and they
OL,14,Fcan't necessarily get the speed up to
OL,15,Fescape them and so they will perish as
OL,16,Fwell," he said.
OL,18,F"It's just another reason to please
