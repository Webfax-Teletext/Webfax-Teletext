OL,6,FI grew up on a farm in North Yorkshire
OL,7,Fand my favourite part of the year was
OL,8,Flambing. I would always spend the half

OL,10,Fmuch as I could alongside school.

OL,13,FFast forward a few years and I work
OL,14,Fbehind the scenes at ITV West Country,
OL,15,Fbut when the opportunity came up to go
OL,16,Flambing on a farm in Somerset, I
OL,17,Fcouldn't resist.

OL,6,FI headed to Cheddar for a couple of
OL,7,Fdays to join Rosie Bloor on her farm.
OL,8,FShe has a flock lambing indoors and
OL,9,Foutdoors.
OL,11,FNow that we are into the warmer

OL,13,Fthe option of outdoor lambing is
OL,14,Fsomething many farmers choose to do,
OL,15,Fbut this was an element completely new

OL,10,FOne of the first tasks was to cover

OL,6,FThen we gave everyone their breakfast.
OL,7,FYou need to be keeping the ewes fit
OL,8,Fand healthy so they produce plenty of
OL,9,Fmilk for the lambs so they get silage,
OL,10,Fwhich is like a nicer version of hay,
OL,11,Fand water. Those having or who had had
OL,12,Fthree lambs get some pellets too for
OL,13,Fextra nutrients.
OL,15,FAlongside all these jobs you can get
OL,16,Fdistracted by new arrivals. There are
OL,17,Fa few signs you can look out for to
OL,18,Ftell you a lamb is on the way. The ewe

OL,6,FIdeally the ewe will do it all
OL,7,Fthemselves, but sometimes you do need
OL,8,Fto step in and help.
OL,10,FThe lamb should be coming with its

OL,12,Fsometimes they could be presenting
OL,13,Fdifferently (tangled up with a
OL,14,Fsibling, leg or head back, coming
OL,15,Fbackwards) so you need to help the ewe.
OL,17,FOnce the lamb is born the ewe will

OL,6,FRosie introduced me to a new version
OL,7,Fwet adoption - using a bucket and
OL,8,Fsalt. You can make the ewe believe she
OL,9,Fhas two lambs instead of one by
OL,10,Fcovering the adopted lamb in the ewe's
OL,11,Fdelivery fluids and salt.
OL,13,FThe salt help the ewe want to lick the
OL,14,Flamb and form the important bond
OL,15,Fbetween then.
OL,17,FThe perks of outdoor lambing are that
OL,18,Fthe ewes can lamb themselves (most of
OL,19,Fthe time) and then you can leave them
OL,20,Fto it.
