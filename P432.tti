OL,3,CPilot recalls first ever flight at
OL,4,CBristol Balloon Fiesta
OL,6,F"Everybody around me said take off,
OL,7,Fand I reluctantly did," says 86-year-
OL,8,Fold Chenube Roy, a female pilot who
OL,9,Fmade the first ever ascent at Bristol
OL,10,FInternational Balloon Fiesta in 1979.
OL,12,FIt was 46 years ago that she made the
OL,13,Fflight from Ashton Court, beating the
OL,14,Fevent's founder Don Cameron who was
OL,15,Fsupposed to have the honour of being
OL,16,Ffirst in the sky.
OL,18,FMs Roy said she was encouraged to take
OL,19,Fflight after the newlywed couple
OL,20,Fflying with her started to get nervous.

OL,6,F"Part of being a pilot is creating a
OL,7,Fnew adventure for other people and
OL,8,Fmaking sure that they're comfortable,"
OL,9,FMs Roy said.
OL,11,F"The bride was beginning to get very
OL,12,Ffrightened, and her husband was
OL,13,Fbeginning to get tense as well, so
OL,14,Feverybody around me said just take

OL,17,F"I felt awful as I knew it wasn't my
OL,18,Fplace to be first," she added. "But
OL,19,FI've talked to Don about it since, and
OL,20,Fhe said he doesn't even rememember it."

OL,6,FMs Roy, who learnt to fly in Norfolk
OL,7,Fafter seeing an advert in the local

OL,9,FInternational Balloon Fiesta once.
OL,11,F45 years passed before she returned to
OL,12,FAshton Court again, in 2023.
OL,14,F"It was very moving," she said. "I was
OL,15,Fin tears. It wasn't that I wished I
OL,16,Fflying, it was just the joy that it
OL,17,Fwas, it is.
OL,19,F"All the memories of ballooning and
OL,20,Fall the wonderful times."

OL,6,FReflecting on her flight at the
OL,7,Ffiesta, Ms Roy said it was a "lovely
OL,8,Fmorning" for flying.
OL,10,FBut she recalled finding it hard to
OL,11,Fchoose a suitable landing place, due
OL,12,Fto the bride's unusual flying attire.
OL,14,FMs Roy explained: "I probably flew a
OL,15,Flittle bit longer than I normally
OL,16,Fwould looking for a field that we
OL,17,Fcould get into without ruining her
OL,18,Fwedding dress.

OL,11,FNot long after becoming the first

OL,14,Fset the first British record for the

OL,11,FShe didn't stop her adventures there,
