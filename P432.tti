OL,6,FOn Wednesday 31 July, Dr Thomas Fox
OL,7,Ftold the inquest he'd never seen an ME
OL,8,Fpatient with such severe symptoms as
OL,9,FMaeve.
OL,11,FMs Boothby said: "I'm hoping the

OL,13,Fwasn't expected to die, didn't want to
OL,14,Fdie.
OL,16,F"Death from ME is extremely rare -
OL,17,Fmalnutrition is common. I believe she
OL,18,Fdied from malnutrition and
OL,19,Fdehydration. I believe her death was
OL,20,Fpremature and highly preventable.
