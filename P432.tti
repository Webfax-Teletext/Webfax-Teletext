OL,6,F"I'm probably one of the oldest,
OL,7,Fsingle foster carers in the country I
OL,8,Fwould think," he said.
OL,10,F"I went to fostering because I lost my
OL,11,Fwife around five or six years ago now.
OL,12,FWe'd been married for 50 years, and I
OL,13,Fdidn't want to spend the rest of my

OL,15,Ftelevision doing nothing."
OL,17,FBorn in the 1930s, Nigel experienced
OL,18,Ffirst-hand a number of historical
OL,19,Fevents during his childhood, including
OL,20,FWinston Churchill's time in office and
OL,21,Fthe Second World War.
