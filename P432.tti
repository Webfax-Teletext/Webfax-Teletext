OL,15,F"It seemed as if both otters had been

OL,6,FThe charity says otter cubs have a
OL,7,Fbetter chance of thriving once they're
OL,8,Fre-released back into the wild if
OL,9,Fthey're paired up. Dave said: "With
OL,10,Fthese two cubs being found at such
OL,11,Fsimilar ages - around three months old
OL,12,F- they make a great pairing
OL,13,Fopportunity. We've started the process

OL,16,Fand in the same enclosure within a
