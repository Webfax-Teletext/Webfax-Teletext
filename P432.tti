OL,7,FThe boss of South West Water has said
OL,8,Fshe is "truly sorry" for the
OL,9,Fdisruption. But the company has faced
OL,10,Fcriticism for 'moving too slowly',
OL,11,Fafter it initially said the water was
OL,12,Fokay to drink despite initial reports
OL,13,Fof sickness, only to issue a 'boil
OL,14,Fnotice' two days later.
OL,16,FIt has also been criticised for poor
OL,17,Fcommunication, with some households
OL,18,Ftold they could resume drinking tap
OL,19,Fwater only to be told that it actually
OL,20,Fremained unsafe just hours later.
