OL,7,FIt is important that you approach the
OL,8,Fsite on the side that you want to
OL,9,Fpark. Using local roads to get to the
OL,10,Fopposite side of the site causes
OL,11,Fdelays so use main roads that are well
OL,12,Faway from the site. A few extra miles
OL,13,Ftravelled further away can save hours
OL,14,Fin queues near to the site. Always
OL,15,Ffollow the directional signs, variable
OL,16,Fmessage signs and park where directed
OL,17,Fby staff.
