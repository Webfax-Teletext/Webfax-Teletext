OL,11,F"There's so much deep culture about
OL,12,Fwild ponies and wild horses", he said.
OL,14,F"That imagination that comes from
OL,15,Fhaving wild horses back in the
OL,16,Flandscape which we miss running wild

OL,19,F"So to encourage this, to allow them

OL,6,FSylvi and Stella were initially kept

OL,10,FJack said: "They've come from a

OL,12,Fwe've kept them in a stable and
OL,13,Frunning them down to a paddock just to
