OL,6,FPalaeontologists have identified what
OL,7,Fmay be the largest known marine
OL,8,Freptile after a father and daughter
OL,9,Ffound a fossil on a Somerset beach.
OL,11,FThe fossilised remains of a gigantic
OL,12,Fjawbone measured more than two metres
OL,13,Flong, and belong to a new species of
OL,14,Fenormous ichthyosaur, a type of
OL,15,Fprehistoric marine reptile.
OL,17,FExperts estimate the giant creature
OL,18,Fwould have been more than 25 metres
