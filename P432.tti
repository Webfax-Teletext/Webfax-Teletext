OL,6,FComing from a farming background, I've
OL,7,Fseen first-hand what the industry
OL,8,Flooks like today and the struggles
OL,9,Ffarmers are facing.
OL,11,FOur countryside used to be a patchwork
OL,12,Fof small, family farms: lots of
OL,13,Ffarmers doing lots of manual work.
OL,14,FThings are different now. Technology
OL,15,Fhas done away with some jobs but
OL,16,Ffarmers face global competition.

OL,6,FSpeaking to Hugh, Celia and Josh Gay,
OL,7,Fit surprised me just how much of their
OL,8,Fincome is from their farm shop and
OL,9,Fcafe rather than their farm itself.
OL,10,FFive-sixths, to be precise! The only

OL,6,FThen there are solar panels - more and
OL,7,Fmore of them are appearing on green
OL,8,Ffields as farmers try to make their
OL,9,Fland pay. For Patrick Twigger on his

OL,11,Ffor solar panels generates a reliable

OL,9,Fthe Royal Agricultural College in
