OL,6,FSam Mason has been leading the

OL,8,Fmassively grown in confidence over the
OL,9,Flast 10 weeks.
OL,11,FSam said: "It's always a real pleasure

OL,14,Fany expectation of what the group's

OL,17,F"But then as the weeks progress you
OL,18,Fget to see the group of people really
OL,19,Fstart to come together and merge
OL,20,Ftogether, and they're creating great
OL,21,Fmusic which has just been joyous."

OL,6,FSophie is a volunteer with The WATCH
OL,7,FProject in Chard. She said music is a
OL,8,Fgreat leveller, and therefore goes
OL,9,Fhand in hand with mental health.
OL,11,FSophie said: "I think it's a way of
OL,12,Fbringing people together where you
OL,13,Fdon't necessarily have to say how you
OL,14,Ffeel. It's a bonding experience - if
