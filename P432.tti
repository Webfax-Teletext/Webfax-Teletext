OL,13,Fa human skull spotted during a beach

OL,6,FOnce the authorities had determined
OL,7,Fthe bones were historic, Dr Richard
OL,8,FMikulski from Cornwall Archaeological
OL,9,FUnit excavated the sites and analysed
OL,10,Fthe skeletons.
OL,12,FDr Mikulski has identified the Sennen
OL,13,Fskull as most likely that of an older
OL,14,Fbronze age man, dated 1300bc.
OL,16,FHe told ITV News: "The bone is very
OL,17,Fwell-preserved, especially given how

OL,6,F"Although only the skull remained of

OL,8,Fhas placed this individual firmly into

OL,12,FAnn said the human bones found on

OL,14,Fhave been easier to analyse.
OL,16,FShe said: "We can piece together far
