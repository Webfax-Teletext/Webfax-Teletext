OL,8,Finternational action
OL,10,FThis weekend's Six Nations games look
OL,11,Fabsolutely mouthwatering. Last weekend
OL,12,Fwas entertaining, don't get me wrong,
OL,13,Fbut we expected three home wins and
OL,14,Fultimately that is exactly what we
OL,15,Fgot. Round two looks to have more
OL,16,Fcapacity to spring surprises.

OL,6,FSo what about the players and coaches
OL,7,Ffrom our part of the world? We'll
OL,8,Fstart with Scotland and Galashiels'
OL,9,FGregor Townsend has quite the task

OL,11,Fcomfortable home win over Italy. They
OL,12,Fface far stiffer opposition on Sunday
OL,13,Fwhen they take on a re-energised
OL,14,FIreland at Murrayfield.
OL,16,FTownsend has now been Scotland's Head
OL,17,FCoach for eight years and has done
OL,18,Fremarkably well in that time to make
OL,19,Fso much out of the meagre resources
OL,20,Fthat a country with only two
OL,21,Fprofessional clubs can produce.

OL,15,Fwill surely have been noted by Andy
