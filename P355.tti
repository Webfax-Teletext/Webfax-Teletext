OL,14,FThe studio's large video walls allow
OL,15,Fthe programme to transform the set,
OL,16,Fdisplaying its distinctive new
OL,17,Fbranding, featuring landmarks
OL,18,Fassociated with London/Westminster and
OL,19,Fother parts of the UK. The style feels
OL,20,Flike a nod to newspaper political
OL,21,Fcartoonists.
