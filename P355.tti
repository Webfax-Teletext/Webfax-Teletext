OL,6,FIn his speech, the former Undertones
OL,7,Fsinger described the impacts of what
OL,8,Fhe called the "sewage scandal" and
OL,9,Fpraised the efforts of Save Windermere.
OL,11,F"Right now in our country, there is so
OL,12,Fmuch sewage going into our rivers and
OL,13,Four lakes, and onto our beaches, it is
OL,14,Falmost mind-bendingly, unbelievably
OL,15,Fcomprehensible.
OL,17,F"By my calculations, over the last
OL,18,Ffive years, water companies in England
OL,19,Fhave spent almost 15 million hours
OL,20,Fdumping sewage into the environment.
