OL,13,Fthe Director of Excavation for the dig.

OL,6,FAround 200 buckets of earth and rubble
OL,7,Fwere taken from the dig site. It took
OL,8,Fvolunteers more than three weeks to
OL,9,Fsift through all of that and while
OL,10,Fthey were doing so they found 34
OL,11,Fgemstones, which give new clues as to
OL,12,Fwhat life was like in Roman Carlisle.
OL,14,F"A lot of these rings aren't military
OL,15,Fand the size of them we think most of
OL,16,Fthese were worn by women so that's
OL,17,Fchanged the way we think about this

OL,6,FExperts think the small gems would

OL,10,F"They've gone into the saunas, the
