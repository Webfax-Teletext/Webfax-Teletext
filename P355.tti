OL,6,GAnother week...another round of

OL,10,Fthe new BBC News channel.
OL,12,FIt remains to be seen just how much
OL,13,FUK News will be included but it
OL,14,Fsounds like there will be more than
OL,15,Foriginally envisaged.
OL,17,FThe principal bespoke UK content will
OL,18,Fbe the main BBC One bulletins,
OL,19,FBreakfast, Newsnight and ` at some
OL,20,Fpoint soon ` Nicky Campbell's 5 Live
OL,21,Fshow.

OL,6,FThis week's edition of Newswatch
OL,7,Faddressed some of the concerns.
OL,9,FIt also emerged that dedicated UK
OL,10,Fcontent will be shown here while the
OL,11,Finternational stream is showing ad
OL,12,Fbreaks.
OL,14,FIt will take a few weeks to be able
OL,15,Fto get a sense of just how the

OL,17,Fpractice.

OL,8,Fchanges to the presentation rota and
OL,9,Fthe departure of some staff skew our

OL,6,FIf the channel seems like a bland
OL,7,Foffering focused on the international
OL,8,Faudience and divorced from licence
OL,9,Fpayers, this could become a corporate
OL,10,Fcatastrophe.
OL,12,FThe decision though to simulcast
OL,13,FNewsnight on the new channel should
OL,14,Fbe welcomed ` even if there is still

OL,6,FFor many of us, there is a logic
