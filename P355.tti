OL,9,FThe first sign of problems came
OL,10,Fimmediately after the opening titles,
OL,11,Fwhen Jo Coburn began verbally
OL,12,Fintroducing the studio guests but
OL,13,Fviewers at home were seeing video of

OL,5,FBelatedly, we cut to a wide shot of the
OL,6,Fstudio and quickly on to the two guests
OL,7,Fthat Jo had almost finished
OL,8,Fintroducing. The director then caught
OL,9,Fup with Jo by quickly moving on to a
OL,10,Fshot of the other two studio guests.
OL,12,FWe then cut to Jo in-vision,
OL,13,Fintroducing the next part of the
OL,14,Fopening sequence, but the video she was
OL,15,Fexpecting didn't materialise.
OL,17,FThe director lingered on Jo for a
OL,18,Ffurther 10 seconds, before the sequence
OL,19,Fwas abandoned, with Jo explaining that
OL,20,Ftechnical issues meant they couldn't
OL,21,Fcontinue with the headline segment.
