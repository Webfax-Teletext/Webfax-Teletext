OL,8,Ftirelessly, including overnight in
OL,9,Fthe equipment rooms, to restore the
OL,10,Ffull-sized mast as quickly as
OL,11,Fpossible."As many will have seen from
OL,12,Frecent pictures, the structure itself
OL,13,Fis very near its full height. Once
OL,14,Fcomplete, we need to install the
OL,15,Fantenna at the top and the feeders `
OL,16,Fwhich take the content up the tower
OL,17,Fto the antenna ` then we will test
OL,18,Fthe transmitters before go-live.  We
OL,19,Fwill continue to update as work
OL,20,Fprogresses."The location of the site
OL,21,Fand the structure means that work is
OL,22,Fheavily dependent on the conditions.
OL,23,FAt around 300m, safety is paramount
OL,24,Fand for those reasons work cannot
