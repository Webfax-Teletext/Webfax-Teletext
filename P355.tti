OL,6,GRecently there was something of a storm
OL,7,Gover reports the BBC was planning an
OL,8,Gonline only future.
OL,10,FThe storm ` which ironically enough was
OL,11,Fmostly online ` died down once the
OL,12,Factual nature of what the BBC had
OL,13,Fsuggested became clearer.
OL,15,FBut terrestrial television does face
OL,16,Fsomething of a challenge. In short,
OL,17,FFreeview has to stay fit for purpose if
OL,18,Fit is to be more than a legacy service.
OL,19,FThe risk is that other options may
OL,20,Fsimply become more attractive to
OL,21,Fviewers.

OL,6,FAt present, it's hard to see why anyone
OL,7,Fwith access to the iPlayer on their TV
OL,8,Fwould use it simply to watch live TV if
OL,9,Fthey also had access to a simple linear
OL,10,Fservice. The joy of the iPlayer is in
OL,11,Fthe wealth of content it offers `
OL,12,Fswitching, say, from the live stream of
OL,13,FBBC One to BBC Two takes a few clicks.
OL,15,FIf you do not want pay TV, the linear
OL,16,Fchoice is between Freeview and Freesat.
OL,18,FFreesat was initially designed as a
OL,19,F"fill in" in the areas where digital
OL,20,Fterrestrial was unavailable before
OL,21,Fswitchover. Later it became an upgrade
OL,22,Ffrom Freeview Light in those places.

OL,6,FThere was little reason for anyone with
OL,7,Faccess to the full Freeview service to
OL,8,Fcontemplate Freesat.
OL,10,FBut the lack of HD on Freeview could
OL,11,Fchange things. Shortly all BBC services
OL,12,Fwill be available in HD on Freesat `
OL,13,Fincluding BBC Alba and Parliament.
OL,15,FThese services will remain SD only on
OL,16,FFreeview ` indeed recently BBC News HD
OL,17,Fwas lost on Freeview. Meanwhile Freesat
OL,18,Fviewers can now watch ITV 2, ITV 3 and
OL,19,FITV 4 in HD.
OL,21,FIf Freeview is to have a future it
OL,22,Fneeds more HD capacity urgently.

OL,6,FIt is time for the broadcasters and
OL,7,FOfcom to review the DTT system
OL,8,Furgently.
OL,10,FThe review could also look at whether
OL,11,Fquite so many multiplexes would be
OL,12,Fneeded if a more efficient transmission
OL,13,Fmethod were used.
OL,15,FIt could also review the future of the
