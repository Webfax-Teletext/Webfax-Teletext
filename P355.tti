OL,6,FCourt's ruling that footpaths in a

OL,13,Fbeen in continuous use since the foot

OL,5,FCampaigner Kol Chaterjee, says it was
OL,6,F"heartbreaking" not being able to walk
OL,7,Fon the pathways with his father and

OL,10,FHe said: "I walked here with my

OL,12,Fwalked here with my son. All of a
OL,13,Fsudden they were just cut-off and we
OL,14,Fweren't allowed access which was quite
OL,15,Fheartbreaking.
OL,17,F"It has been very restrictive, because
OL,18,Fnow we're all corralled in one path.
OL,19,FWe can't enjoy the woods, the river or
OL,20,Fthe places that we used to visit."

OL,5,FThe Ramblers Association is a charity

OL,9,Fsays this result will 'set a

OL,12,FHe said: "We took the case to prove

OL,15,Fthough the usage of these paths were

OL,5,FCampaigner Ewan Cartwright, said:
