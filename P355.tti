OL,6,FTransport Secretary, Mark Harper, said
OL,7,Fthe new funding is "truly game-
OL,8,Fchanging for the smaller cities,
OL,9,Ftowns, and rural communities across
OL,10,Fthe North West.JHe added: "This new
OL,11,Ffunding boost will make a real
OL,12,Fdifference to millions of people in
OL,13,Fthe North West, empowering local
OL,14,Fauthorities to drive economic growth,
OL,15,Ftransform communities, and improve the
OL,16,Fdaily transport connections that
OL,17,Fpeople rely on for years to come."JThe
OL,18,Ffunding comes from money originally
OL,19,Fallocated to the cancelled northern
OL,20,Fleg of HS2 last year.JMr Harper said:
OL,21,F"It's part of the decision we took
OL,22,Flast year to cancel the second phase
OL,23,Fof HS2 - #36billion of savings, every
OL,24,Fpenny spent on transport and spent in
OL,25,Fthe parts of the country that it was
OL,26,Fgoing to be spent.

OL,6,FThe transport minister insisted that

OL,8,Fallow local authorities to invest in
OL,9,Ftheir own transport systems: "I'm
