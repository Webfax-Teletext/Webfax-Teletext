OL,6,FOver a decade after Jean Hanlon was
OL,7,Ffound dead in Crete, new evidence has
OL,8,Fbeen discovered which could lead to
OL,9,Ffinding her killer.
OL,11,FJean had moved to the Greek island to
OL,12,Fstart a new life but went missing and
OL,13,Fwas found dead in the sea off the
OL,14,Fharbour of Crete's capital Heraklion.
OL,16,FHer death was originally ruled as
OL,17,Fdrowning, but last year, after a long
OL,18,Fcampaign from her family, the Greek
OL,19,Fauthorities confirmed that her death
OL,20,Fwas the result of foul play but didn't
OL,21,Ftake the investigation any further.
