OL,6,FAn investigation by the Heath and

OL,8,Fpotential presence of hydrogen
OL,9,Fsulphide gas in the pump house on the
OL,10,Fmorning Mr Cole was found.
OL,12,FHydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a
OL,13,Fcolourless but toxic gas which is a
OL,14,Fbyproduct of some processes that occur
OL,15,Fat the Futamura plant. It has a strong
OL,16,Fodour similar to that of rotten eggs.

OL,6,FInvestigator Jason Wan told the court
OL,7,Fthat, while no conclusive evidence
OL,8,Fexists of the presence of H2S on that
OL,9,Fmorning, he had identified two ways in
OL,10,Fwhich the gas could have entered the
OL,11,Froom via the drainage system.
OL,13,FEvidence from Cumbria Fire and Rescue
OL,14,Fidentified the presence of H2S in the
OL,15,Fpump house later on the same day.
OL,17,FMr Wan's investigation concluded that
OL,18,FH2S was present in the pump house on
OL,19,Fthe morning of 24 December 2021.

OL,6,FManaging Director of Futamura Adrian

OL,9,Fits way into the pump house via the

OL,13,FHowever, he reiterated that there is
OL,14,Fno evidence to prove that it was
OL,15,Fpresent when Mr Cole was found.
OL,17,FHe also said that because the entire
OL,18,FFutamura plant has a sulphurous smell,
OL,19,Fit is difficult to accept the
OL,20,Feyewitness memories of the rotten egg
OL,21,Fsmell as proof of the presence of H2S.
