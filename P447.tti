OL,6,FFor any of us who experience a crisis,
OL,7,Fparticularly a matter of life and
OL,8,Fdeath, those who are kindest to us and
OL,9,Fwho help manage the situation, leave
OL,10,Fan indelible mark and live long in our

OL,13,FFor others, that strength of feeling

OL,15,Fto show more active measures of
OL,16,Fsupport.
OL,18,FMarcus Christie's mother Joan was

OL,14,F"The Air Ambulance was there within 25
