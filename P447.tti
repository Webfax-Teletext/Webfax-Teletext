OL,7,Frest of the UK, it is all about trying
OL,8,Fto protect household incomes, they are
OL,9,Feven talking about tax reductions, and
OL,10,Fyet in Northern Ireland we are being
OL,11,Fasked to increase the tax burden on
OL,12,Fhard-working families."
OL,14,FShe added that the Executive is united
OL,15,Fin their aim to help families with the
OL,16,Ffinancial pressure they are under
OL,17,F"rather than adding to their
OL,18,Fpressures".
OL,20,FOne of the main issues putting a
OL,21,Fstrain on family finances is childcare.
