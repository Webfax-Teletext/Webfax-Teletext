OL,6,FUTV has uncovered footage from almost

OL,8,Fhaemophiliac being injected with
OL,9,FFactor 8 - hailed as "wonder
OL,10,Ftreatment" at the time, which turned
OL,11,Fout to be very far from the actual
OL,12,Fcase.
OL,14,FToday the Prime Minister offered an

OL,17,Fwhich should "shake our nation to the

OL,20,FRishi Sunak promised "comprehensive
