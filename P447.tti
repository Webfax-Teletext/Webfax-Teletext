OL,8,Fstands out. Humility leaves its mark.
OL,10,FFor Theresa Kelly, when her sister,

OL,12,Fbreast cancer, the treatment that she
OL,13,Freceived at the Foyle Hospice left not
OL,14,Fjust an indelible mark but also a
OL,15,Fprecious, positive memory from one of
OL,16,Fthe darkest of times.
