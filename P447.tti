OL,11,FThe potential for revenue raising from

OL,14,FOne of the first rumours which emerged
OL,15,Fover the summer was that stamp duty
OL,16,Fcould be scrapped and replaced with a
OL,17,Ftax on the sale of homes.
OL,19,FIn other words the seller instead of
OL,20,Fthe buyer would have to pay out.

OL,5,F"They need to inject a bit of
OL,6,Fconfidence in England, I don't think
OL,7,Fthey are going to do that by raising
OL,8,Ftaxes, introducing a mansion tax or
OL,9,Fincreasing stamp duty."
OL,11,FHomes worth over half a million pounds
OL,12,Fwould likely be targeted for that
OL,13,Fannual levy or mansion tax as some
OL,14,Fpeople call it.
OL,16,FBut for those looking to get on the

OL,18,Ffeel the market is always against
