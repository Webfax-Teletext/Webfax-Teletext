OL,6,F"Now it's not a straightforward
OL,7,Fcomparison but in England, the highest
OL,8,Fcouncil tax bills would be in and
OL,9,Faround #5,000 to #5,500 and so what I
OL,10,Fam proposing to the Executive is a

OL,12,Fapproach.
OL,14,F"It would be an elevation of the max

OL,19,Fparties in the Executive will have to
