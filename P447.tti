OL,8,FUTV can reveal the impact hoax calls
OL,9,Fare having on the ability of our
OL,10,Femergency services to carry out their
OL,11,Fjobs - and there are fears these
OL,12,Fnuisance calls could costs lives.
OL,14,FFigures obtained by UTV show that the
OL,15,FAmbulance Service is wasting more than
OL,16,F2 months a year responding to hoax
OL,17,Fcalls.
OL,19,FThe service spent on average 74 days a
OL,20,Fyear worth of hours responding to hoax
OL,21,Fcalls between 2020-23

OL,6,FThe PSNI, as well as the Ambulance
OL,7,FService have be stretched thin in
OL,8,Frecent years and having to deal with
OL,9,Fhoax calls is another issue they could

OL,12,FMr McDonald added: "The challenges

OL,14,Fparticularly in the context of
