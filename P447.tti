OL,6,FBelfast's homelessness crisis is "the
OL,7,Fworst it has been for a long time", an
OL,8,Foutreach team has said.
OL,10,FServices are stretched, teams are
OL,11,Funder pressure and temporary
OL,12,Faccommodation is reportedly more
OL,13,Fdifficult to secure due to demand.
OL,15,FHomelessness in the city is not a new

OL,17,Fmore dangerous.
