OL,7,FPreviously the inquiry had been told

OL,13,Fofficials were "surprised" as they
OL,14,Fbelieved the notes had been supplied
OL,15,Fto the inquiry.JShe outlined efforts
OL,16,Fthat had been made by the inquiry to
OL,17,Fobtain those notes and follow-up
OL,18,Fqueries around missing materials.JMs
OL,19,FDobbin said the inquiry "set out to
OL,20,FThe Executive Office that these
OL,21,Fhandwritten notes cover a period of
OL,22,Fsignificant interest to the inquiry
OL,23,Fand it's plainly of concern if these

OL,11,Ffact that the TEO in fact told the
