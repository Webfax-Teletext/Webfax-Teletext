OL,10,Fthink I could probably speak for a lot
OL,11,Fof children who have been in foster
OL,12,Fcare and were adopted, there's always
OL,13,Fthat feeling of 'what did I do to

OL,15,Fsome way'?
OL,17,F"It was such a relief at the end to
OL,18,Ffinally hear everything, as much as
OL,19,Fsome of it is quite hard to hear...
OL,20,Fbut it finally gives you a bit of self
OL,21,Fworth, you know your own story now."
