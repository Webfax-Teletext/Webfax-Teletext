OL,6,FThe site of Casement Park in west
OL,7,FBelfast has laid unused since 2014.
OL,9,FThe project has been delayed by a
OL,10,Fseries of planning disputes and legal
OL,11,Fchallenges and the estimated costs
OL,12,Fhave spiralled to at least double the
OL,13,Foriginal figure, with some suggesting
OL,14,Fthe bill could exceed #200million.
OL,16,FThe stadium is one of the venues
OL,17,Fselected to host matches in the Euro
OL,18,F2028 football tournament, which is
OL,19,Fbeing jointly hosted by the UK and

OL,8,FCasement Park was "a nice plot of

OL,12,FThe precise breakdown for the funding

OL,14,Fto be agreed.
OL,16,FThe Irish Government last week pledged
OL,17,F50million euro (#42.7 million) for the
