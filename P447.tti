OL,11,FIt comes after the first Asian Hornet

OL,6,FBeekeeper Chris Hodgins spoke of his
OL,7,Fconcern following the first sighting.
OL,9,F"So what the hornet will do, it will
OL,10,Ftake the honey bee, go to an adjacent
OL,11,Ftree, and basically pull off its head
OL,12,Fand feed on the muscle tissue in the
OL,13,Fthorax," he told UTV.
OL,15,F"Our bees have got no natural defenses
OL,16,Fagainst the Asian hornet because
OL,17,Fthey're from Asia.

OL,6,F"Therefore they're very easy prey, but
OL,7,Fit's not just honey bees that are the
OL,8,Fissue. It's a whole range of other
OL,9,Fpollinators. Hoverflies, wasps are all
OL,10,Ffacing the same problem, but honey
OL,11,Fbees are a big big stationary colony
OL,12,Fand therefore it's an easy meal for
OL,13,Fthe hungry hornet.
OL,15,F"It's a big problem for beekeepers who
OL,16,Frely upon honey as their source of
OL,17,Fincome. To make honey, you need bees,
OL,18,Fand if the hornets are eating a fair
OL,19,Fportion of your bees, then it's a bit
OL,20,Fof a problem."
