OL,3,CNew museum to tell the stories of
OL,4,CIrish soldiers in the British Army
OL,6,F"The British Army came to Ireland in
OL,7,Fthe 19th century to find soldiers,
OL,8,Fbecause Ireland didn't have an
OL,9,Findustrial revolution, it didn't have
OL,10,Fan agricultural revolution and so
OL,11,Fthere was lots of strong, sturdy men,
OL,12,Fthat they couldn't find in England
OL,13,Fbecause they'd all gone to the
OL,14,Fcities", Andy Hart told UTV.
OL,16,FThe museum will challenge the
OL,17,Fcontested and divisive narratives
OL,18,Fwhich have emerged in Northern Ireland
OL,19,Fin the latter half of the 20th century.
