OL,5,FHe added: "This is about both early
OL,6,Flearning and childcare.J"This strategy
OL,7,Fwill have dual aims, supporting both
OL,8,Fchild development and enabling
OL,9,Fparental employment. It is about
OL,10,Fgiving children the best start in life
OL,11,Fand supporting working families. It is
OL,12,Fimportant that the work we do and the
OL,13,Fmodel we put in place is capable of
OL,14,Fachieving both.J"I am aware that the
OL,15,Fcost of childcare is putting immense
OL,16,Fstrain on family finances and in some
OL,17,Fcases is preventing parents,
OL,18,Fparticularly women, from entering and

OL,23,Fthe strategy would be the "real test
