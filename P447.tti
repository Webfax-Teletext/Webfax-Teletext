OL,8,Ftaking up his ministerial role he was
OL,9,Fmade aware that unspent "ring-fenced

OL,11,FUK Government" as part of Fresh Start
OL,12,Fhad now been "rolled into the wider
OL,13,Fpackage of #3.3bn".
OL,15,F"Therefore we in education have lost

OL,17,Fthere, it is no longer available to my
