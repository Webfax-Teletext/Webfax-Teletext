OL,6,FDr Ursula Mason, Royal College of GPs
OL,7,Fsaid: "I think what's different this

OL,9,Fcases and the number of people getting
OL,10,Fsick from flu happening in greater
OL,11,Fnumbers this year but also much
OL,12,Fearlier in the season.
OL,14,F"So often this kind of a rise is
OL,15,Fhappening later on, perhaps in January
OL,16,Finto February but now we're seeing it
OL,17,Fearly in December and that's really
OL,18,Fquite concerning.
