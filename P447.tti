OL,5,FColin Broomfield, director of markets
OL,6,Ffor the Utility Regulator, said the
OL,7,Freductions are "primarily driven by
OL,8,Fthe steady fall in wholesale energy
OL,9,Fprices".J"In January 2024, the Utility
OL,10,FRegulator commenced a review of Power
OL,11,FNI's regulated electricity tariff, and
OL,12,FSSE Airtricity and Firmus Energy's
OL,13,Fregulated gas tariffs," he said.
OL,14,F"Following our analysis, we have
OL,15,Fagreed that a 6.3% decrease in Power
OL,16,FNI's electricity tariff and a 22.8%
OL,17,Freduction in SSE Airtricity's
OL,18,Fregulated gas tariff will become
OL,19,Feffective from April 1 2024. These
OL,20,Freductions are primarily driven by the
OL,21,Fsteady fall in wholesale energy
OL,22,Fprices.J"These reductions will see a
OL,23,Ftypical Power NI's domestic customer
OL,24,Fpaying #64 less a year. The annual
