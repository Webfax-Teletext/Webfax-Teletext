OL,6,FLinda's trip was nearly over before it
OL,7,Fhad properly begun when she capsized
OL,8,Fonly two days into the journey and
OL,9,Fbroke her boat.
OL,11,F"It was quite shocking" Linda said and
OL,12,Fshe added: "I didn't want to get
OL,13,Frescued, I lost two of my oars as
OL,14,Fwell. The waves just ripped the oars
OL,15,Fout of my hand and they break the
OL,16,Fgate, which is the round thing that
OL,17,Fthe oar sits in.

OL,11,FLinda had her ups and downs on the

OL,13,Fher: "I did fear for my life out there
