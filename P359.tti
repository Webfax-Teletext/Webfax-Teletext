OL,5,FBBC Two trade test transmissions were
OL,6,Fseverely curtailed and the transmitters
OL,7,Fwere left off for much of the daytime.
OL,8,FIt was annoying to the trade as it made
OL,9,Fit harder to install TVs and aerials
OL,10,Fbut amongst the wider public only
OL,11,Fhardcore fans of the test card would
OL,12,Fhave been disappointed.
OL,14,FThe move was only formally reversed in
OL,15,F1983 at the same time as schools

OL,5,FObviously daytime shutdowns are now out

OL,7,Fchannels are broadcast on the same
OL,8,Fmultiplex, it makes no difference when
OL,9,Fan individual channel like BBC Three or
OL,10,FFour is off air.
OL,12,FIf there were to be any benefit in

OL,15,Fon a particular multiplex would need to
