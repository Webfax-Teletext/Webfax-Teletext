OL,5,GThere was a minor playout error tonight
OL,6,Gon BBC Two, immediately after
OL,7,GNewsnight.
OL,9,FAs usual, we exited Newsnight and went
OL,10,Fstraight to the Weather. However, one
OL,11,Fsecond into the weather bulletin, we
OL,12,Fmoved on to the next event in the
OL,13,Fplayout schedule: a slide for Newscast.
OL,15,FThe announcer would normally have
OL,16,Fvoiced the Newscast slide  but not
OL,17,Fhere. A trail for Laura Kuenssberg's
OL,18,FSunday morning political programme then
OL,19,Fplayed out in full, before the
OL,20,Fpre-recorded Weather was recued and
OL,21,Fplayed out in full.

OL,5,FWhen network exited the Weather

OL,7,Fcontent, the clean feed switched to the
OL,8,Fgeneric animation. And that's what

OL,5,FProgramme content is available on the

OL,7,Flonger (at each end) than on the
OL,8,Fconventional network feed. That's why

OL,10,Fairing of the Weather bulletin held on
OL,11,Fits opening frame for 5 seconds, before
OL,12,Fplaying.
OL,14,FThe lack of live voiceover (by the
OL,15,FWelsh announcer) on the Newscast slide
OL,16,Ffollowing the Weather was presumably
OL,17,Fbecause the BBC Two Wales
OL,18,Fdirector/announcer was still adjusting
OL,19,Fthe local playout schedule to
OL,20,Fcompensate for the network error.
