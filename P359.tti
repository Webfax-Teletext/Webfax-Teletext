OL,4,GITV's main channel is to be return to
OL,5,Gits former name of ITV 1 after nearly
OL,6,G10 years. ITV staff have been briefed
OL,7,Gon the plan which is part of a wider
OL,8,Gbranding shake-up.
OL,10,FThe move coincides with the launch of
OL,11,Fthe new streaming service ITVX.
OL,13,FIt seems like a case of going back to
OL,14,Fthe future.
OL,16,FI was surprised when the name ITV 1 was
OL,17,Fdropped in 2013 just as it seemed to be
OL,18,Fgetting accepted by the public.

OL,4,FThe argument was that it aligned the
OL,5,Fname of the company with the name of
OL,6,Fits principal service. It was also
OL,7,Fargued that viewers still called the
OL,8,Fchannel ITV.
OL,10,FNow the aim is to distinguish between
OL,11,Fthe channel and the company again.
OL,12,FHopefully the return of the ITV 1 name
OL,13,Fwill succeed this time.
OL,15,FNothing would be worse in the modern
OL,16,Fenvironment than the old ITV identity
OL,17,Fcrisis with viewers using a myriad of
OL,18,Fmodern and historic regional names.

OL,4,FSome Pres fans need to remember that
OL,5,Fthe old regional names and idents
OL,6,Freflected a federal system which has
OL,7,Flong gone. Some regional names such as
OL,8,FGranada were legendary but viewers in
OL,9,Fthe south west saw 4 names in 18 years.
OL,11,FIt would be wrong to judge the new look
OL,12,Fbranding until it appears on screen.
OL,14,FBut there's an interesting question for
OL,15,FPres fans and viewers in Northern
OL,16,FIreland: will the last remnants of UTV
OL,17,Fchannel branding survive?

OL,9,FThis time, they will need a full

OL,12,FDoes the last remaining use of the UTV
