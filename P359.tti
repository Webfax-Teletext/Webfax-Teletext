OL,5,FUntil recently, the Freeview HD
OL,6,Fmultiplex (PSB3) as broadcast from
OL,7,FWinter Hill had been relayed to all
OL,8,Ftransmitters across Northern England.
OL,9,FEarlier this month, some transmitter
OL,10,Fgroups began carrying bespoke
OL,11,Fversions of the multiplex in order to
OL,12,Fcarry regional programmes.
OL,14,FThe same limitations meant ITV 1
OL,15,Fcouldn't offer fully regionalised
OL,16,Fnews on Freeview HD, but it is yet to
OL,17,Fconfirm if it will make use of the
OL,18,Fnew regional structure to allow
OL,19,Fviewers to access their local ITV
OL,20,Fnews on the service.
