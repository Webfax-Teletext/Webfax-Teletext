OL,7,FTrust, says the sculpture will 'be
OL,8,Ficonic.' He said: "It will attract
OL,9,Fpeople, but it also signifies where
OL,10,FScotland starts effectively. I think
OL,11,Fit's a great piece of artwork and you
OL,12,Fwill certainly notice it and recognise
OL,13,Fit.
OL,15,F"In the same way that the Kelpies and
OL,16,Fthe Angel of the North attract quite a
OL,17,Flot of visitors each year, we would
OL,18,Fexpect the same sort of impact over
OL,19,Fhere. It will just develop further."
