OL,5,GBoth the main public service
OL,6,Gbroadcasters are celebrating big
OL,7,Gbirthdays. The BBC is marking its
OL,8,Gcentenary just as Channel 4 turns 40.
OL,10,FThere are certain parallels.
OL,12,FBoth face a degree of uncertainty about
OL,13,Ftheir future and finding the right way
OL,14,Fto mark the occasions may not have been
OL,15,Feasy.
OL,17,FThe BBC's centenary had seemed an

OL,5,FAnd just what should be celebrated? The
OL,6,FBBC as it is today? Its rich heritage?
OL,7,FOr its humble origins on Savoy Hill.
OL,9,FActually the three are interlinked. The

OL,9,Fsomething bigger.
OL,11,FOver at Channel 4, the celebrations
OL,12,Fhave seemed more muted.
OL,14,FA revival of Friday Night Live was a
OL,15,Freminder of one part of its special
OL,16,Fpersonality. No doubt Countdown will be
OL,17,Fmarking its own 40th in style. (There

OL,5,FChannel 4 has commissioned a range of
OL,6,Fedgy programmes as part of a 40th
OL,7,Fanniversary season which are not about
OL,8,FChannel 4 or the anniversary itself.
OL,10,FThis is actually in keeping with the
OL,11,Fchannel's early personality ` offering,
OL,12,Ffor example, Christmas programmes which
OL,13,Fcontrasted with the explicitly festive
OL,14,Fofferings elsewhere.
OL,16,FBut then again today's Channel 4 is not

OL,15,FWill there be any revival of the
