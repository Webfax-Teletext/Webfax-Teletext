OL,6,GSoaps and continuing dramas have a
OL,7,Gstrong relationship with their regular

OL,10,Gthe bond with viewers can be broken.
OL,12,FFor some time, there has been

OL,14,Fthe long-term decline in its ratings.
OL,16,FIn general, of course, it's important
OL,17,Fto remember that what really matters is
OL,18,Fhow many people overall see the

OL,6,FBut the BBC's scheduling of its soaps
OL,7,Fand continuing dramas has become
OL,8,Fsomewhat erratic. It isn't just an

OL,14,FThe revival of Waterloo Road was, in

OL,6,FMeanwhile in Scotland, the scheduling
OL,7,Fof the local soap River City has become
OL,8,Fa little erratic. It was off air last
OL,9,Fsummer and is now off the air again
OL,10,Funtil May. For its first 18 years it
OL,11,Fnever took a break.
OL,13,FWhy is this a problem?
OL,15,FFor a soap or a continuing drama,
OL,16,Fregularity is vital. The viewer needs
OL,17,Fto know it is there at a certain time.

OL,6,FThere is s strategic argument to
OL,7,Fexplore here though.
OL,9,FDoes the BBC really need to have soaps
OL,10,Fand continuing dramas? Should it focus
OL,11,Fits resources on one-offs, short-run
OL,12,Fdramas and big hitters with, say,
OL,13,Fannual runs of 8, 10 or 13 episodes?
OL,15,FThe respected writer Russell T. Davies
OL,16,Frecently suggested the number of
OL,17,Fepisodes of EastEnders should be scaled
OL,18,Fback. Certainly it could open up slots
OL,19,Fin the schedule and you might wonder if
OL,20,Fit might be easier for those with busy
OL,21,Flives to follow soaps again if there
OL,22,Fwere fewer episodes.

OL,6,FYou also wonder if Casualty could be
OL,7,Frevived if it was, once again, an
OL,8,Fannual series of ` say ` 13 episodes.
OL,10,FOf course any moves like these would be
OL,11,Fdifficult and no doubt controversial.
OL,13,FBut Is it simply the case that the
OL,14,Fmarket is saturated and that ITV has
OL,15,Fthe upper hand? Should the BBC put up a
OL,16,Fwhite flag and accept there are other
OL,17,Fways to win ratings? Or should ongoing
OL,18,Fdramas remain part of the mix as they
OL,19,Fcan connect with people the corporation
