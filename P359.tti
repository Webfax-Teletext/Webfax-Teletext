OL,6,FSo, after days of "will she, won't
OL,7,Fshe?", we got the answer this
OL,8,Fafternoon.
OL,10,FKate Forbes will not stand to become
OL,11,Fleader of the, and Scotland's next
OL,12,FFirst Minister. There will be a
OL,13,Fcoronation, not a contest.
OL,15,FBarring a late challenger unexpectedly
OL,16,Femerging before nominations close on
OL,17,FMonday John Swinney will be crowned -
OL,18,Fin a political sense - next week,
OL,19,Ftaking over from Humza Yousaf.

OL,6,FThe question in Holyrood is why did Ms
OL,7,FForbes, who ran Mr Yousaf extremely
OL,8,Fclose in the race to replace Nicola
OL,9,FSturgeon just over a year ago, not
OL,10,Fthrow her hat in the ring.
OL,12,FThe answer appears to lie in a mix of
OL,13,Fpragmatism and principle - as is often
OL,14,Fthe case when political decisions are
OL,15,Fmade.
OL,17,FMost observers believe that , a former
OL,18,Fparty leader, ex-deputy First
OL,19,FMinister, and party stalwart for four
OL,20,Fdecades would have been harder to beat
OL,21,Fthan Mr Yousaf nearly was.

OL,6,FHe had also, as we subsequently
OL,7,Flearned, offered her a big job in
OL,8,Fgovernment if she stood aside and
OL,9,Fbacked him. That's the pragmatic bit.
OL,11,FThe principle lies in the direction Ms

OL,13,Fhas been critical of aspects of the

OL,6,FHer fears, shared by some within her

OL,15,FBut it was obvious that, for good or

OL,17,Ffurther to the Left as a result of the
OL,18,Ftwo party alliance.
