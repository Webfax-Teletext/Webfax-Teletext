OL,7,F"Once someone becomes The Speaker
OL,8,Fthey're meant to give up their party

OL,14,FConservatives it was against the SNP
OL,15,Fbut he took the side of the Labour

OL,7,F"I think he came under enormous
OL,8,Fpressure from the Labour Party which
OL,9,Fwas wrong in itself, and shouldn't
OL,10,Fhave happened, but nevertheless the
OL,11,Fspeaker should've kept a central role

OL,14,F"The Clerk of the House of Commons
OL,15,Fsaid that he had broken precedent and
OL,16,Fthat he shouldn't had done what he did

OL,18,Fthat I think that his role in being
OL,19,Fneutral was compromised.
