OL,6,FHigh school students have been
OL,7,Flearning about a difficult topic which
OL,8,Faffects us all, as they take lessons
OL,9,Fin death and bereavement.
OL,11,FThe pupils at Castle Douglas High
OL,12,FSchool are engaging in a three-day
OL,13,Fcourse called 'The D Word', which aims
OL,14,Fto help pupils explore their feelings
OL,15,Faround bereavement, and suggests
OL,16,Fcoping mechanisms.
OL,18,FThe course was designed by a
OL,19,Fcelebrant, who says she wants to take
OL,20,Faway "the fear of the unknown".

OL,6,FAileen Palmer told ITV Border: "We
OL,7,Fstarted to look at the barriers to
OL,8,Ftalking about death in society, and
OL,9,Fhow it's increasingly hidden from our
OL,10,Fculture.
OL,12,F"We then looked at what happens in a
OL,13,Fnormal death, and what needs to happen
OL,14,Fpractically: power of attorney and
OL,15,Fwills."
OL,17,FOne pupil, Kirstie Benson, said the
OL,18,Fcourse had been helpful, as she deals
OL,19,Fwith losing her mother when she was in
OL,20,Fprimary school.

OL,6,FKirstie said: "It's hard to lose
OL,7,Fanyone in your life, no matter what
OL,8,Fage you are. You grow with your grief,
OL,9,Fyou don't get used to it.
OL,11,F"You get on with it, basically - it's
OL,12,Fall you really can do."
OL,14,FThe English curriculum is set to
OL,15,Finclude bereavement training, but no
OL,16,Fequivalent is planned in Scotland.
OL,17,FThis course has so far been given in
OL,18,Ffour Scottish schools.
