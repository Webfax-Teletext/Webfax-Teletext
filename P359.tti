OL,5,GThe director-general of the BBC Tim
OL,6,GDavie has said that whilst it's
OL,7,G"obviously sad" that three
OL,8,Glong-standing news presenters have
OL,9,Gopted to depart the organisation the
OL,10,Gcurrent level of "management
OL,11,Ginefficiency" needs to be addressed.
OL,13,FYesterday, Deadline reported that BBC
OL,14,FNews presenters David Eades, Joanna
OL,15,FGosling and Tim Willcox have opted to
OL,16,Ftake voluntary redundancy.

OL,5,FThe news came as the BBC continues the
OL,6,Fphased implementation of a merger of
OL,7,Fits international and domestic TV news
OL,8,Fchannels. The official start date for
OL,9,Fthe new channel is believed to be some
OL,10,Ftime in April, though the on-air launch
OL,11,Fis expected to be low-key.
OL,13,FIn July, the BBC announced plans to
OL,14,Fmerge the two TV news channels, as part
OL,15,Fof its new digital-first strategy. Over
OL,16,F70 posts are believed to face the axe
OL,17,Fas a result.

OL,5,FDavie told the Public Accounts
OL,6,FCommittee: "There is a degree of
OL,7,Fmanagement inefficiency, in my view,
OL,8,Fand it is not right, and no one in the
OL,9,Fworld is running completely separate
OL,10,Foperations in this way.
OL,12,F"Now linked to that, I think that it is
OL,13,Fobviously sad when people decide to
OL,14,Ftake VR and leave, but you need less
OL,15,Fpresenters and I think that is
OL,16,Fappropriate.

OL,5,F"Sorry to be blunt. I think we are in a
OL,6,Fposition where we are going to make
OL,7,Fchanges. Some people will leave the
OL,8,FBBC, some people will stay. Actually
OL,9,Fso-called churn in the newsroom is very
OL,10,Flow historically.
OL,12,F"You talk about three outstanding
OL,13,Fpresenters who have chosen to move on,
OL,14,Fthat gives opportunities and allows
OL,15,Fpeople to move through the
OL,16,Forganisation."
OL,18,FMr Davie said he not believe the BBC
OL,19,Fneeded "two completely separate
OL,20,Foperations" and that their merger plans
OL,21,Fweren't just about "digital evangelism"
OL,22,Fbut "based on where the audience is".
