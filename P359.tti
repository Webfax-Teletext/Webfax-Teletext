OL,6,FBut the BBC's scheduling of its soaps
OL,7,Fand continuing dramas has become
OL,8,Fsomewhat erratic. It isn't just an

OL,14,FThe revival of Waterloo Road was, in

OL,16,FCasualty's sister programme Holby

OL,6,FMeanwhile in Scotland, the scheduling
OL,7,Fof the local soap River City has
OL,8,Fbecome a little erratic.  It was off
OL,9,Fair last summer and is now off the
OL,10,Fair again until May. For its first 18
OL,11,Fyears it never took a break.
OL,13,FWhy is this a problem?
OL,15,FFor a soap or a continuing drama,
OL,16,Fregularity is vital. The viewer needs
OL,17,Fto know it is there at a certain
OL,18,Ftime.  Otherwise the relationship
OL,19,Fgoes. When the relationship goes and
OL,20,Fthe ratings fall, a programme's

OL,9,FDoes the BBC really need to have

OL,6,FThe respected writer Russell T.
OL,7,FDavies recently suggested the number
OL,8,Fof episodes of EastEnders should be
OL,9,Fscaled back. Certainly it could open
OL,10,Fup slots in the schedule and you
OL,11,Fmight wonder if it might be easier
OL,12,Ffor those with busy lives to follow
OL,13,Fsoaps again if there were fewer
OL,14,Fepisodes.
OL,16,FYou also wonder if Casualty could be
OL,17,Frevived if it was, once again, an
OL,18,Fannual series of ` say ` 13 episodes.
OL,20,FOf course any moves like these would
OL,21,Fbe difficult and no doubt
