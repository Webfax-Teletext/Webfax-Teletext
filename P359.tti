OL,5,GLast week we noted the temporary
OL,6,Gincrease in advertising on the three
OL,7,Gmain commercial channels.
OL,9,FITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 all lost
OL,10,Fsome advertising time following the
OL,11,Fdeath of HM The Queen and during the
OL,12,Fperiod of mourning.
OL,14,FWith Ofcom's approval they can now make
OL,15,Fup some of the "lost minutes" by
OL,16,Frunning more adverts than normal.
OL,18,FThe big rule is that they still cannot
OL,19,Fhave more than 12 minutes in a clock
OL,20,Fhour.
OL,3,CAre we getting a taste of potential new
OL,4,Cad rules for commercial PSBs?

OL,5,FSo does this offer us a taste of what
OL,6,Fthings may be like if Ofcom allows a
OL,7,Fpermanent increase in the amount of
OL,8,Fadvertising on the three main
OL,9,Fcommercial PSBs?
OL,11,FWe looked carefully at advertising
OL,12,Fbetween 5pm and 12am on ITV between
OL,13,FFriday and Sunday.
OL,15,FThere was 12 minutes of advertising in
OL,16,Fthe 5pm, 7pm, 8pm, 9pm and 11pm hours.
OL,18,FThe 6pm hour contained two breaks  one
OL,19,Fof 4 minutes between the regional and
OL,20,Fnational news and one of 3 minutes 30
OL,21,Fseconds at approximately 6.45pm.
OL,3,CAre we getting a taste of potential new
OL,4,Cad rules for commercial PSBs?

OL,5,FIf a full 12 minutes were to be allowed
OL,6,Fin each hour, the likelihood is that 2
OL,7,Fmore breaks would be included totalling
OL,8,F4 minutes and 30 seconds.
OL,10,FIn the 10pm hour, there was 8 minutes
OL,11,Fof advertising  4 minutes before News
OL,12,Fat Ten and 4 minutes after the regional
OL,13,Fnews. Again 4 minutes would need to be
OL,14,Ffound to "max out" each hour.
OL,16,FIt should be noted that internal breaks
OL,17,Fcan normally only include 3 minutes 30
OL,18,Fof ads but there is no cap on the
OL,19,Famount during breaks between
OL,20,Fprogrammes.

OL,5,FThere was one "trail break" at around
OL,6,F5.55pm which could have been extended
OL,7,Fand replaced by a 3 minute 30 seconds
OL,8,Fad break.
OL,10,FAfter 6pm, only the 8pm hour didn't
OL,11,Finclude a full 12 minutes of ads  it
OL,12,Fonly included 10 minutes and 30 seconds
OL,13,Fworth.
OL,15,FBetween 5pm and 12am there was almost
OL,16,Fas much advertising as would be
OL,17,Fallowable after any potential increase.
OL,19,FThe 6pm hour fell slightly short by 30

OL,5,FIt's certainly interesting to get a
OL,6,Fsense of what things could potentially
OL,7,Fbe like in a few months time.
OL,9,FSaturday and Sunday evenings on ITV
OL,10,Fwould hardly be any different 
OL,11,Falthough a little reconfiguration could
OL,12,Fbe needed.
OL,14,FThere is also the question of whether
OL,15,Fprogramme durations might need to be
OL,16,Ftweaked to ensure the schedule runs to
OL,17,Ftime and that there is room for
OL,18,Fpromotions  some promo time has been
OL,19,Fsacrificed to allow for the temporary

OL,5,FThe broader economic arguments over
OL,6,Fwhether it would be beneficial to allow
OL,7,Fmore advertising need proper scrutiny.
OL,9,FBut given that the public hardly seem
OL,10,Fto have noticed the current rise, it's
OL,11,Fhard to suggest viewers will lose out
OL,12,Ftoo much. Perhaps some newspaper
OL,13,Fjournalists need to watch more TV?
OL,15,FOfcom is seeking views until next week
OL,16,Fover whether to look at relaxing the
OL,17,Frestrictions affecting advertising on
OL,18,FPSBs. It will then decide whether to
OL,19,Frun a full consultation on any proposed
