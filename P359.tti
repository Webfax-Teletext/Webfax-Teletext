OL,4,GBoth the main public service
OL,5,Gbroadcasters are celebrating big
OL,6,Gbirthdays. The BBC is marking its
OL,7,Gcentenary just as Channel 4 turns 40.
OL,9,FThere are certain parallels.
OL,11,FBoth face a degree of uncertainty about
OL,12,Ftheir future and finding the right way
OL,13,Fto mark the occasions may not have been
OL,14,Feasy.
OL,16,FThe BBC's centenary had seemed an

OL,18,Fspecial programmes over the past week
OL,19,Fhave played to its core audience.

OL,9,FThe special episodes of Doctor Who and

OL,5,FBBC as it is today? Its rich heritage?
OL,6,FOr its humble origins on Savoy Hill.
OL,8,FActually the three are interlinked. The

OL,4,FIt's been interesting to see the use of
OL,5,Fa common ident for the anniversary
OL,6,Facross different channels. Again this
OL,7,Fsuggests each service is part of
OL,8,Fsomething bigger.
OL,10,FOver at Channel 4, the celebrations
OL,11,Fhave seemed more muted.
OL,13,FA revival of Friday Night Live was a
OL,14,Freminder of one part of its special
OL,15,Fpersonality. No doubt Countdown will be
OL,16,Fmarking its own 40th in style. (There

OL,4,FChannel 4 has commissioned a range of
OL,5,Fedgy programmes as part of a 40th
OL,6,Fanniversary season which are not about
OL,7,FChannel 4 or the anniversary itself.
OL,9,FThis is actually in keeping with the
OL,10,Fchannel's early personality  offering,
OL,11,Ffor example, Christmas programmes which
OL,12,Fcontrasted with the explicitly festive
OL,13,Fofferings elsewhere.
OL,15,FBut then again today's Channel 4 is not
OL,16,Fthe channel of the 80s and 90s even if
OL,17,Fit's more distinctive parts speak to
OL,18,Fits roots.

OL,9,Ftoo well that so many of the serious,
OL,10,Fchallenging programmes and minority
OL,11,Finterests which also ran through its

OL,14,FWill there be any revival of the

OL,16,Fthe blocks has less of an impact now as
OL,17,Fit has happened so often.
