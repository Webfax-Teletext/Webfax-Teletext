OL,11,Fwhether there was a case to change the

OL,13,FChannel 5.

OL,7,FCelebrity, you'll be aware of the kind
OL,8,Fof archaic compromises ITV has to make
OL,9,Fto stay within the rules.
OL,11,FITV is allowed 40 minutes of
OL,12,Fadvertising between 6pm and 11pm with
OL,13,Fno more than 12 minutes in each hour.
OL,15,FOn a typical weeknight, there are 4

OL,18,F7pm and the start of News at Ten.

OL,10,FInstead, the network news followed its

OL,6,FIt is important to look properly at
OL,7,Fwhether there are genuine economic
OL,8,Fbenefits to advertisers and
OL,9,Fbroadcasters from allowing more
OL,10,Fadvertising. It is possible they may
OL,11,Fconclude that the same amount of
OL,12,Fadvertising spending could simply be
OL,13,Fspread more thinly.
OL,15,FIt should also be clear that
OL,16,Fbroadcasters do not need to use their
