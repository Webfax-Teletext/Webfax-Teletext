OL,6,FNew research may explain why people's

OL,9,Fthe hit TV series The Traitors.
OL,11,FThe popular BBC show follows a group

OL,6,FIn the second series, screening now,
OL,7,Fthe Traitors have so far proved
OL,8,Felusive with the Faithful struggling
OL,9,Fto identify who should and should not
OL,10,Fbe trusted.
OL,12,FA study from the School of Psychology
OL,13,Fat the University of Aberdeen found
OL,14,Fwhen people encounter groups, they
OL,15,Fjudge their trustworthiness by
OL,16,Fcombining their facial features into
OL,17,Fone "composite face", which
OL,18,Fresearchers say can have serious

OL,6,FPostgraduate student Fiammetta Marini
OL,7,Fexplained: "We know that we
OL,8,Fsubconsciously judge whether an
OL,9,Findividual is trustworthy based on
OL,10,Ffacial characteristics.
OL,12,F"For example, high eyebrows that seem
OL,13,Fsurprised-looking in their shape,
OL,14,Falong with a U-shaped mouth, are
OL,15,Fusually perceived as trustworthy.
OL,17,F"On the other hand, eyes close
OL,18,Ftogether or lower eyebrows are often
OL,19,Fperceived as untrustworthy.
