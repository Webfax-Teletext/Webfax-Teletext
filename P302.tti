OL,6,FWhen dealing with food delivery
OL,7,Fcompanies, Ms Vincent said there is
OL,8,Foften is a dispute whether a driver is
OL,9,Fdeemed an employee or self-employed,
OL,10,Fwhich means a company would not be
OL,11,Fliable for the individual.
OL,13,FAs most companies class their drivers
OL,14,Fas self-employed, they tend to shift
OL,15,Fthe blame away from them, she added.

OL,6,F"That being said, ample training is
OL,7,Fsupposed to be supplied by the company
OL,8,Fand clear CRB checks obtained. Data
OL,9,Fsuch as telephone numbers collected
OL,10,Fand passed on by the company to the
OL,11,Fdriver should be limited to purpose
OL,12,Fand perhaps the ability for such
