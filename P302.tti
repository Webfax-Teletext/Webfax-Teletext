OL,6,FIn October last year, the Court of

OL,8,Fpayments to car dealers as part of
OL,9,Ffinance arrangements made before 2021
OL,10,Fwithout the motorist's fully informed
OL,11,Fconsent were unlawful.
OL,13,FHowever, two lenders, FirstRand Bank
OL,14,Fand Close Brothers, took the row to
OL,15,Fthe Supreme Court, telling a three-day
OL,16,Fhearing in April that the decision was

OL,12,Ftelling the UK's highest court that
OL,13,Fthe Court of Appeal ruling "goes too

OL,17,FIn August, the Supreme Court ruled
