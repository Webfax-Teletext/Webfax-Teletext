OL,7,FThe report said the Government should
OL,8,Fdevelop a physical campus for a
OL,9,F"National School for Government and
OL,10,FPublic Services".
OL,12,FThe committee said having a physical
OL,13,Fcampus would create "a 'network
OL,14,Feffect' of civil servants across
OL,15,Fdepartments, enabling more effective
OL,16,Fcollaboration in future".
OL,18,FThis would "embed cultural change in

OL,20,Fculture of strategic thinking and
OL,21,Fbreak the cycle of short-term thinking.

OL,11,Fyears is vital to restoring public
OL,12,Fconfidence in our entire democratic

OL,14,Fgenerations who will inherit the
OL,15,Fconsequences of what governments do
OL,16,Fnow.
OL,18,F"The next government should seize this
