OL,7,FMcIntyre once said during a stand-up

OL,14,FChristina Sanchez-Stockhammer and

OL,7,FThe regular Briton will be familiar
OL,8,Fwith the classics, such as "wasted" or
OL,9,F"hammered". These ol' faithfuls have
OL,10,Fmarked their territory at the top of
OL,11,Fthe nation's favourite drunkonyms list.
OL,13,FBut what about "fried", "toastered",
OL,14,For "sozzled"? Well, they're valid too,
OL,15,Faccording to this study.
OL,17,FThe professors discovered that "drunk"
OL,18,Fmainly occurs in the combinations
OL,19,F"too", "so", or "very" drunk but
OL,20,Funexpectedly, not with the kinds of
OL,21,Fadverb used by McIntyre.

OL,7,FBy contrast, the drunkonyms ending in

OL,7,FThe linguists therefore provided an

OL,9,FEnglish native speakers reach
OL,10,Fadulthood, they have most likely
OL,11,Fexperienced so many different words
OL,12,Fending in -ed meaning "drunk" that it
OL,13,Fallows them to interpret words with
OL,14,Funknown meaning ending in -ed (such as

OL,7,FWhat renders McIntyre's examples
OL,8,F"gazeboed" or "carparked" funny is
OL,9,Fthat there is no obvious relation
OL,10,Fbetween the base (e.g. "gazebo") and
OL,11,Fthe meaning "drunk".
OL,13,FThe English language also expresses
