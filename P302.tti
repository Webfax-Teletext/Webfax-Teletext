OL,7,FDonald Trump has doubled down on his
OL,8,Fdecision to pursue tariffs against the
OL,9,FUnited State's nearest neighbours,
OL,10,Fdespite widespread concern.
OL,12,FThe US president has introduced a 25%
OL,13,Flevy on goods coming from Mexico and
OL,14,FCanada, and a 10% trade tax on Chinese
OL,15,Fgoods, which will come into effect on
OL,16,FTuesday.
OL,18,FThe penalties have sparked fears of a
OL,19,Fnew era of trade wars across the globe.

OL,12,Fallowed to so freely flow into
