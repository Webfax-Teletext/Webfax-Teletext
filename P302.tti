OL,15,FHe argued that say, there are still
OL,16,F"countless people" who have not

OL,19,FThe Labour leader said many were fed

OL,21,Fbut still had questions about Labour.

OL,7,FOne challenge that I put to Starmer in

OL,9,Fhe had set out big ambitions around
OL,10,Fhousebuilding, renewable energy and
OL,11,Fthe NHS but was ruling out increasing
OL,12,Ftwo of the big tax rates - National
OL,13,Finsurance and Income tax.
OL,15,FSurely that tied his hands?
OL,17,F"I think that working people have been
