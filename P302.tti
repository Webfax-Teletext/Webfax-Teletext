OL,5,F"For 15 years Kris had been living
OL,6,Fwith secondary breast cancer. She
OL,7,Fhasn't lost a battle, she wasn't in a
OL,8,Ffight and she certainly wouldn't want
OL,9,Fyou to see her death as tragic. She
OL,10,Fwas simply living. She was 38 and died
OL,11,Fwith fulfilment and a heart full of
OL,12,Flove," CoppaFeel wrote.
OL,14,FMs Hallenga had thrown herself a
OL,15,Fliving funeral to celebrate her life
OL,16,Fbefore her death, and it featured Dawn
