OL,13,FLord Justice Arnold, sitting with Lord

OL,15,FLewison, said the High Court judge
OL,16,Ffound the yellow circle with a red

OL,10,Fand the conclusion is one that the

OL,13,FHowever, Lord Justice Arnold
OL,14,Foverturned the previous finding of
OL,15,Fcopyright infringement against Tesco.
OL,17,FHe said: "Any painter will confirm
OL,18,Fthat placing one colour against
