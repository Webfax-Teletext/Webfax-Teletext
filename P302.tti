OL,6,FThe teasing was mainly one-sided and
OL,7,Fthe intention was to playfully provoke
OL,8,Fa response or attract the target's

OL,11,FThe researchers said that just like in
OL,12,Fhumans, ape teasing was found to be
OL,13,Fpersistent and included elements of
OL,14,Fsurprise and play.
OL,16,FThey said the findings, published in
