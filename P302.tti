OL,6,FOne of the key ministers involved in
OL,7,Forganising the relief effort says no
OL,8,Fcountry in the world could have coped
OL,9,Fwith the scale and intensity of the
OL,10,Fstorm.
OL,12,FMatthew Samuda, the minister for
OL,13,Fclimate change, told me that this
OL,14,Fhurricane was so monstrous that it
OL,15,Fshould even be recognised as an
OL,16,Fentirely new extreme weather
OL,17,Fphenomenon - the world's first
OL,18,F"category six" storm.

OL,6,FHe told ITV News: "This is a storm
OL,7,Fwhich could be classified as the
OL,8,Fworld's first category six hurricane.
OL,10,F"If this storm had hit New York or
OL,11,FLondon, the response would not be much
OL,12,Fdifferent - because it was 185mph
OL,13,Fwinds, sustained, that hit a very old
OL,14,Fset of towns. So this is to be
OL,15,Fexpected."
OL,17,FHe continued: "There is no
OL,18,Fjurisdiction on earth that would
OL,19,Ffunction seamlessly post-185mph storm."

OL,6,FHe also told ITV News that the world

OL,6,FThe minister also insisted that the

OL,8,FJamaica would now dramatically ramp
OL,9,Fup, acknowledging some failures.
OL,11,FHe said the slow response can be

OL,6,FThat is unlikely to diminish the
