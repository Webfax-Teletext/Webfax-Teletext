OL,7,Fcandidate, you've probably never heard
OL,8,Fof. The Green Party's Dr Jill Stein -
OL,9,Fwho is barely mentioned by American

OL,12,FShe is only polling at around one per
OL,13,Fcent - depending on your perspective,
OL,14,Fthat could be the reason for her lack
OL,15,Fof coverage or the result of it.
OL,17,FBut either way, her tiny share of the
OL,18,Fvote could have a mighty impact on the
OL,19,Foutcome and nowhere more so than in
OL,20,Fthe crucial swing state of Michigan.
