OL,9,Fwe're not alone and many other

OL,12,FIt's a tough financial market out

OL,6,FCovid obviously dealt the festival

OL,8,Freturned after the pandemic. Those
OL,9,Fwhich did survive have struggled to
OL,10,Fbreak even ever since. Overall
OL,11,Foperational costs have risen by more

OL,3,CWhy are so many festivals cancelling
OL,4,Cthis summer?
OL,6,FMany smaller festivals also lack the
OL,7,Fcash reserves to pay the production
OL,8,Fcosts up front. It is an industry
OL,9,Fwhich is hugely reliant on temporary
OL,10,Flabour and the leasing of equipment.
OL,11,FBrexit has restricted access for many
OL,12,Ffestival workers from Europe and made
OL,13,Fthe logistics pool smaller. Many
OL,14,Fproviders also want payment up front.
OL,15,FHowever, if festival attendees leave
OL,16,Fit late to buy tickets, some
OL,17,Forganisers decide to cancel altogether
OL,18,Frather than run at a loss.
