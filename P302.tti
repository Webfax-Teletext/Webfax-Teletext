OL,6,FMet Office spokesman Stephen Dixon
OL,7,Fsaid on Friday there was a good chance
OL,8,Ffor the Northern Lights to be seen.
OL,10,FHe said: "Although the shorter nights
OL,11,Fwill limit the visibility window,
OL,12,Fthere's a good chance to see the
OL,13,Faurora, particularly on Friday night
OL,14,Fand especially in Scotland, Ireland
OL,15,Fand parts of northern England and
OL,16,FWales.
OL,18,F"There could even be visibility
OL,19,Ffurther south if you have the right
OL,20,Fequipment.

OL,11,FMr Dixon said the combination of clear
OL,12,Fskies and enhanced activity from the
OL,13,Fsun reaching Earth would improve the
OL,14,Fchances of seeing the display.
OL,16,FAurora displays occur when charged
