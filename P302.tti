OL,10,FThe heavy rainfall which has
OL,11,Fdevastated southern Spain was "about
OL,12,F12% heavier and twice as likely" as a
OL,13,Fresult of climate change.
OL,15,FThat's according to World Weather

OL,8,Fthe more energy weather systems have

OL,6,FIt's a phenomenon where cold air from
OL,7,Fthe North Atlantic meets warm humid
OL,8,Fair from the Mediterranean forcing the
OL,9,Fhot air to rise quickly and form huge
OL,10,Frain clouds that can then get stuck

OL,14,FThis often happens in the autumn but

OL,13,FBecause the entrance at the Strait of
