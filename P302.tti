OL,7,FFollowing that arrest, the Crown

OL,9,Fthat the star should receive a caution.
OL,11,FHowever, a Metropolitan Police officer
OL,12,Fappealed that decision, and she was
OL,13,Fcharged with assault by beating.
OL,15,FIt was later ruled, by a coroner, that

OL,17,Fbecause of her prosecution and the
OL,18,Fpublicity she feared the trial would
