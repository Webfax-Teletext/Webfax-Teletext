OL,6,FAn ancient ritual which involves
OL,7,Fblowing into a large shell could
OL,8,Ftackle the symptoms of a common sleep
OL,9,Fdisorder, a study suggests.
OL,11,FThe practice of conch blowing, also
OL,12,Fknown as shankh blowing, could improve
OL,13,Fsleep for patients with obstructive
OL,14,Fsleep apnoea (OSA) without the need
OL,15,Ffor uncomfortable machinery, according
OL,16,Fto researchers.
OL,18,FShankh blowing involves breathing in
OL,19,Fdeeply before exhaling forcefully into
OL,20,Fa conch, the spiral-shaped shell from
OL,21,Fa species of sea snail.

OL,12,F"It involves a deep inhalation
OL,13,Ffollowed by a forceful, sustained
OL,14,Fexhalation through tightly pursed lips.
OL,16,F"This action creates strong vibrations
OL,17,Fand airflow resistance, which likely
OL,18,Fstrengthens the muscles of the upper
OL,19,Fairway, including the throat and soft
OL,20,Fpalate, areas that often collapse
OL,21,Fduring sleep in people with OSA.
