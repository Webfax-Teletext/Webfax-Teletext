OL,11,FSicily on Monday - has said that the
OL,12,Fsearch for six people on board is
OL,13,F"very complicated" because it is still
OL,14,Fintact.
OL,16,FThe rescue search resumed on Tuesday
OL,17,Fafter the luxury yacht sank due to
OL,18,Fintense storms. It is currently on the
OL,19,Fseabed at a depth of 50 metres.

OL,8,FConcordia - the cruise ship that sank

OL,10,F2012 with more than 4,000 passengers

OL,13,FItaly's fire brigade Vigili del Fuoco
OL,14,Fsaid that earlier inspections of the
OL,15,FBayesian wreck had been "unsuccessful"
OL,16,Fbecause of limited access to the

OL,7,F"complex," with divers limited to 12-
OL,8,Fminute underwater shifts, two of which
OL,9,Fmust be spent going up and down.
OL,11,F"Our search and rescue activity by sea

OL,16,F"Of course, we do not exclude that

OL,19,Fadding that "we suppose that the six
