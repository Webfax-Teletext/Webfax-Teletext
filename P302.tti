OL,6,FDonald Trump has doubled down on his
OL,7,Fdecision to pursue tariffs against the
OL,8,FUnited State's nearest neighbours,
OL,9,Fdespite widespread concern.
OL,11,FThe US president has introduced a 25%
OL,12,Flevy on goods coming from Mexico and
OL,13,FCanada, and a 10% trade tax on Chinese
OL,14,Fgoods, which will come into effect on
OL,15,FTuesday.
OL,17,FThe penalties have sparked fears of a
OL,18,Fnew era of trade wars across the globe.
