OL,8,FLabour for "abandoning" women
OL,9,Fconcerned about transgender rights.
OL,11,FThe Harry Potter author said she would

OL,16,FWriting in The Times, Ms Rowling said:
OL,17,F"As long as Labour remains dismissive
OL,18,Fand often offensive towards women
OL,19,Ffighting to retain the rights their
OL,20,Fforemothers thought were won for all
OL,21,Ftime, I'll struggle to support them.
