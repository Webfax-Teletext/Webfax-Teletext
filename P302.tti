OL,7,Ffree beer brand has revealed a festive
OL,8,Fsales surge as it said shoppers have
OL,9,Ffound "new occasions" to have a pint.
OL,11,FThe boss of Lucky Saint said it traded
OL,12,F"particularly well" over December, as
OL,13,Fmany drinkers have moderated their
OL,14,Falcohol consumption throughout the
OL,15,Fyear and not only for Dry January.
OL,17,FEmma Heal, chief executive of the
OL,18,Fbrand, said the brand has benefited
OL,19,Ffrom customers choosing to drink beer
OL,20,Fon more occasions amid the growth of
