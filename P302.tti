OL,10,FThe Democratic jamboree in Chicago has
OL,11,Fheard from the great and the good of
OL,12,Fthe party this week, but no voice
OL,13,Fcarries more weight than Barack Obama.
OL,15,FHe remains their biggest star and best
OL,16,Fcommunicator. Last night he strode
OL,17,Fonto the stage to hear the adulation
OL,18,Fof the gathered delegates and
OL,19,Fdelivered a message which sought to
OL,20,Fgalvanise Kamala Harris' reputation.

OL,7,FRather than focusing on her service

OL,9,Frecounted her earlier life and career
OL,10,F- a deliberate strategy to carve out
OL,11,Fan identity distinct from the 46th
OL,12,FPresident. He talked about her "not
OL,13,Fbeing born into privilege" and praised
OL,14,Fher work to help child victims of
OL,15,Fsexual abuse as a prosecutor.
OL,17,F"Kamala Harris won't be focused on her
OL,18,Fproblems - she'll be focused on
OL,19,Fyours...She'll work on behalf of every
OL,20,FAmerican. That's who Kamala is," he
