OL,3,CWhy the Tories may struggle to fund
OL,4,Cthe tax cuts they've pledged
OL,6,F"Vote Tory, pay less tax." That's the
OL,7,Fpitch.JThe manifesto sets out cuts
OL,8,Fworth #17.2 billion a year by the end
OL,9,Fof the next parliament.JIf re-elected,
OL,10,Fthe Tories say they would cut the rate
OL,11,Fof National Insurance to 6% by April
OL,12,F2027 for employees.JAnd phase-out the
OL,13,Ftax altogether for the self-employed,
OL,14,Fover a five year period.JThe Institute
OL,15,Ffor Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculates
OL,16,Fsomeone on average earnings of #35,000
OL,17,Fa year would pay #300 less if the full
OL,18,Fcut was introduced.JThe saving is not
OL,19,Fhigher because the Tories would
OL,20,Fcontinue to freeze the thresholds of
OL,21,Fnational insurance and income tax for
OL,22,Fseveral years until 2028.JAs for the
OL,23,Ftax burden, this cut would be a drop
OL,24,Fin the fiscal bucket. The overall tax
OL,25,Ftake would continue rising north of
OL,26,F#1100 billion.

OL,3,CWhy the Tories may struggle to fund
OL,4,Cthe tax cuts they've pledged
OL,6,FTax as share of GDP is currently
OL,7,Fforecast to reach 37.1% in by 2028/29
OL,8,F- the highest level for 80 years.JThe
OL,9,FTory manifesto pledges would bring
OL,10,Fthat down to 36.5% - still the highest
OL,11,Flevel for, erm, 80 years.JIn addition
OL,12,Fto tax cuts, the Tories promise a big
OL,13,Fincrease in defence spending.JThe
OL,14,Fmanifesto says these would be funded
OL,15,Fby cuts to welfare spending, a
OL,16,Fcrackdown on tax avoidance, layoffs in
OL,17,Fthe civil services and "quango
OL,18,Fefficiences" - whatever they might be.
OL,19,FSceptical? You're not alone.JTake
OL,20,Fwelfare. Spending shot up in the last
OL,21,Fparliament.JThe number of people
OL,22,Fgetting one health-related benefit has
OL,23,Fsoared from 3.2 million to 4.2 million
OL,24,Fsince the pandemic and is forecast to
OL,25,Fcontinue rising.

OL,3,CWhy the Tories may struggle to fund
OL,4,Cthe tax cuts they've pledged
OL,6,FThe Tories say they will save #12
OL,7,Fbillion a year by holding financial
OL,8,Fsupport at current levels.JThat would
OL,9,Fbe a challenge. New claims for
OL,10,Fdisability support are coming through
OL,11,Fat a rate of 40,000 a month.J"We've
OL,12,Fhad a doubling in the numbers applying
OL,13,Ffor disability benefits," says Paul
OL,14,FJohnson of the IFS. "It's entirely
OL,15,Freasonable for a government to think
OL,16,Fabout how to tackle that. But can they
OL,17,Fget #12 billion? You can see why they
OL,18,Fwould want to but not how."JThe risk
OL,19,Fhere is the Tories get elected, don't
OL,20,Fget the savings they want and have to
OL,21,Fborrow to fund tax cuts and extra
OL,22,Fdefence spending.JAnd it's not clear
OL,23,Fthey would be able to do this because
OL,24,Fthe Tory manifesto also contains a
OL,25,Fpledge to get debt falling as a share
OL,26,Fof national income over a five year
