OL,6,FThe work and pensions secretary's

OL,9,Fand under the OBR-assessed fiscal
OL,10,Frules, Reeves would have to fill a
OL,11,F#5bn hole in her finances in the

OL,13,Fcreated by Kendall's partial welfare-

OL,9,Fby their disrespect for the OBR.
OL,11,FBut they do question why the
OL,12,FChancellor and Treasury endow the OBR
OL,13,Fwith an almost mystical ability to
OL,14,Fdetermine which policies are sensible,
OL,15,Fand why Reeves has seemingly abdicated
