OL,6,FIt probably isn't helpful to think of
OL,7,Flower interest rates as "good" news or
OL,8,Fhigher interest rates as being "bad" -
OL,9,Fthe level simply reflects the world as
OL,10,Fit is, a very uncertain place.
OL,12,FThe Bank of England has cut Bank Rate
OL,13,Fto 4.5% partly because it feels
OL,14,Freassured that prices and wages are
OL,15,Fbehaving as predicted and partly
OL,16,Fbecause the UK economy is stuck in the
OL,17,Flowest gear.
