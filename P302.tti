OL,6,FUS Attorney Martin Estrada announced

OL,9,FHe said the doctors supplied Perry
OL,10,Fwith a large amount of ketamine and
OL,11,Feven wondered in a text message how
OL,12,Fmuch the former "Friends" star would
OL,13,Fbe willing to pay.
OL,15,F"These defendants took advantage of

OL,17,Fthemselves. They knew what they were
