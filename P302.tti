OL,8,FThe Democratic jamboree in Chicago has
OL,9,Fheard from the great and the good of
OL,10,Fthe party this week, but no voice
OL,11,Fcarries more weight than Barack Obama.
OL,13,FHe remains their biggest star and best
OL,14,Fcommunicator. Last night he strode
OL,15,Fonto the stage to hear the adulation
OL,16,Fof the gathered delegates and
OL,17,Fdelivered a message which sought to
OL,18,Fgalvanise Kamala Harris' reputation.

OL,5,FRather than focusing on her service

OL,7,Frecounted her earlier life and career
OL,8,F- a deliberate strategy to carve out

OL,11,Fbeing born into privilege" and praised
OL,12,Fher work to help child victims of

OL,15,F"Kamala Harris won't be focused on her

OL,5,FKamala Harris is no doubt riding a
OL,6,Fwave of enthusiasm, but sustaining it
OL,7,Fwill be critical to winning in
OL,8,FNovember. Her path started last night
OL,9,Fwith a ceremonial roll-call of
OL,10,Fdelegates pledging their support to
OL,11,Fher, even though she already had
OL,12,Fofficially secured the nomination in a
OL,13,Fvirtual vote two weeks ago.
OL,15,FSo the party transformed this process
OL,16,Ffrom a dry number tally, to a showbiz
OL,17,Fspectacular. Rapper Lil' Jon turned
OL,18,Fhis home state of Georgia's
OL,19,Faffirmation of Harris into one of the
OL,20,Fhighlights of the night, as he sang
OL,21,Fhis state's support for Kamala.
