OL,7,Fshowing a shiny haired boy celebrating
OL,8,Fhis birthday.
OL,10,FNabeel was sitting on a hospital bed
OL,11,Fand trying to wave his arm in time to
OL,12,Fmusic blaring out from a plastic
OL,13,Fspeaker. On the sheets in front of

OL,6,FThe little boy with the serious face
OL,7,Fwas turning five. Always a healthy
OL,8,Fchild, he was diagnosed with cancer as
OL,9,FIsrael began its assault on Gaza, in
OL,10,Fthe wake of the Hamas attack on
OL,11,FOctober 7th. Chemotherapy for children
OL,12,Flike him is no longer available in the
OL,13,Ffew hospitals left, but barely
OL,14,Ffunctioning, in the territory.
OL,16,FHis Palestinian doctors have spent

OL,19,Fthe end of their shifts to try to
OL,20,Foffer advice.

OL,6,FMeanwhile a British charity, Children
OL,7,FNot Numbers, sent innumerable emails
OL,8,Fto government officials in Israel and
OL,9,FEgypt, which control the border, to
OL,10,Ftry to get Nabeel out of Gaza.
OL,12,FDriving the effort, was Somaya
OL,13,FOuazzani, a British lawyer, who made
OL,14,Fphone call after phone call, often
OL,15,Fwhile nursing her own young baby.
OL,17,FFinally, she got the news that
OL,18,FNabeel's route out had been approved.
OL,19,FBut the day after he was told he was
OL,20,Fheading to safety, Israel closed
