OL,6,FMerchan ruled Trump violated the order
OL,7,Fon April 22, after the jury was

OL,10,Fhow it was selected. "That jury was
OL,11,Fpicked so fast - 95% Democrats.
OL,13,FThe area's mostly all Democrat," Trump
OL,14,Fsaid in an interview with right-wing
OL,15,Fstreaming network Real America's Voice.
OL,17,F"It's a very unfair situation that I
OL,18,Fcan tell you."

OL,3,CJudge threatens to jail Trump for
OL,4,Cviolating court's gag order
OL,6,FMerchan previously found Trump in
OL,7,Fcontempt of court for nine previous
OL,8,Fviolations, fining him the maximum
OL,9,Fallowed by law, $1,000 per instance,
OL,10,For $9,000. On Monday, Merchan
OL,11,Fthreatened to jail Trump if another
OL,12,Fviolation occurs.
OL,14,F"It appears, for the tenth time, that
OL,15,Fthe $1,000 fines are not serving as a
OL,16,Fdeterrent.
OL,18,FTherefore, going forward this court
OL,19,Fwill have to consider a jail
OL,20,Fsanction," Merchan announced.
