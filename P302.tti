OL,7,FAn Israeli probe into the killings of
OL,8,F15 Palestinian medics last month in
OL,9,FGaza has said it has found
OL,10,F"professional failures" and that a
OL,11,Fdeputy commander will be fired.
OL,13,FIsrael at first claimed that the
OL,14,Fmedics' vehicles did not have
OL,15,Femergency signals on when troops
OL,16,Fopened fire but later backtracked.
OL,17,FMobile phone footage recovered from
