OL,7,FNational Trust curator Jane Eade said
OL,8,Fvan Dyck's portrait, in the Royal
OL,9,FCollection (1635-6), was "much copied"
OL,10,Fbut "only three Le Blon prints of it
OL,11,Fwere known to survive".
OL,13,F"To have a discovered a fourth is
OL,14,Freally exciting, especially as it is
OL,15,Fthe only version that remains hanging
OL,16,Fin its historic setting," she said.
OL,18,FAnalysis of the piece helped identify
OL,19,Fthe colours Le Blon is known to have
OL,20,Fused, such as indigo and carmine or
