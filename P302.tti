OL,8,FNorovirus belongs to a group of
OL,9,Fviruses that are the most common cause
OL,10,Fof stomach bugs in England.
OL,12,FThe virus can be transmitted easily
OL,13,Ffrom person to person through contact
OL,14,Fwith contaminated surfaces or objects
OL,15,Fand by consuming contaminated food or
OL,16,Fwater.

OL,6,FOutbreaks can be difficult to control

OL,9,Freferred to as the "winter vomiting
OL,10,Fbug", it can strike at any time of
OL,11,Fyear.
OL,13,FThe symptoms of norovirus normally
OL,14,Fbegin around 12-48 hours after the
OL,15,Fperson is infected.
OL,17,FThe main symptoms include vomiting and
OL,18,Fwatery diarrhoea which lasts for 12-60
OL,19,Fhours. Other symptoms may include a
OL,20,Fraised temperature, headaches, stomach
OL,21,Fcramps and aching limbs.
