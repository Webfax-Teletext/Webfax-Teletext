OL,12,FIn January 2023, Karen Kerr, 58,
OL,13,Fphoned her son Iain Legge to say she
OL,14,Fwas struggling to use her hands, could
OL,15,Fnot stand up, and her speech was slow
OL,16,Fand slurred.
OL,18,FHe feared she had had a stroke, but it
OL,19,Fsoon emerged she had suffered brain
OL,20,Fdamage as a result of a genetic
