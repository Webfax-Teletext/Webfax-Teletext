OL,6,FResearchers have identified an area of
OL,7,Fhuman and mouse DNA that plays a role
OL,8,Fin controlling anxiety.
OL,10,FA University of Aberdeen team found a
OL,11,Fsection of DNA which "switches" on key
OL,12,Fgenes in parts of the brain that
OL,13,Faffect anxiety levels in mice.
OL,15,FThey found removal of the "switch"
OL,16,Fincreased anxiety in the animals.
OL,18,FThe team now hope further research
OL,19,Finto the switch could help improve the
OL,20,Flives of anxiety patients by
OL,21,Fidentifying a new drug target.

OL,12,F"This part of the genome, known as the

OL,15,Fthe tools to do so.
OL,17,F"We also know that the non-coding

OL,20,Fwhere and when to be turned on.
