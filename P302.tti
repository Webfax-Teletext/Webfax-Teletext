OL,6,FForecaster Simon Partridge said the
OL,7,Fchill stemmed primarily from "a little
OL,8,Fridge of high pressure moving across
OL,9,Fthe UK overnight", adding "the main
OL,10,Fdifference between that and previous

OL,13,FMr Partridge said that much of the

OL,15,Fbut that later in the day there is
OL,16,Fexpected to be widespread sunshine.
