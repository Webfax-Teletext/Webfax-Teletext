OL,4,Cdeported?
OL,6,FBrahim Kaddour-Cherif, the Algerian
OL,7,Fsex offender mistakenly released from
OL,8,FHMP Wandsworth, had overstayed his
OL,9,Fvisa. So why hadn't he been deported?
OL,11,FThe answer raises important questions
OL,12,Fabout the dysfunctional interplay of
OL,13,Fvisa rules with the criminal justice
OL,14,Fsystem, which I assume will trouble
OL,15,FMPs.
OL,17,FHere is what official sources tell me
OL,18,Fis the explanation for why Kaddour-
OL,19,FCherif had not been expelled from the
OL,20,FUK.

OL,6,FThe point, I am told, is that none of

OL,8,Fautomatic deportation, namely a 12-

OL,11,FEven so, initial deportation
OL,12,Fproceedings - or what's known as a

OL,12,FBut - and here is what some will see

OL,15,Fbecause of pending prosecutions.
OL,17,FThe unfortunate consequence is that he
