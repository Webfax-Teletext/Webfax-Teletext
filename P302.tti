OL,6,FWatch Nigel Farage discuss ECHR,

OL,8,Fand more - with Lewis Denison.
OL,10,FNigel Farage has said the first thing

OL,12,Fwon a general election would be to
OL,13,Fremove the UK from the European
OL,14,FConvention on Human Rights.
OL,16,FThe Reform UK leader claimed "three
OL,17,Fquarters of the country would cheer to
OL,18,Fthe rafters", suggesting that leaving
OL,19,Fthe ECHR would allow ministers to take
OL,20,Faction which would cut illegal
