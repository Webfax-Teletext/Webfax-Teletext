OL,13,FThey described the steel conker as

OL,6,FMr Jakins said he was found with the
OL,7,Fsteel conker in his pocket, but that
OL,8,Fhe only carried it around "for humour
OL,9,Fvalue", adding he "did not use it
OL,10,Fduring the event", according to The
OL,11,FTelegraph.
OL,13,F"Yes, I did help prepare the conkers
OL,14,Fbefore the tournament. But this isn't
OL,15,Fcheating or a fix, and I didn't mark
OL,16,Fthe strings. I just tried to hit hard,
OL,17,Fand somehow, I finally won," he added.

OL,6,FThe first of the event's ten
OL,7,Fparticipation rules states that: "All
OL,8,Fconkers and laces are supplied by the
OL,9,FWorld Conker Championships. Laces must
OL,10,Fnot be knotted further or tampered
OL,11,Fwith. Conkers are drawn 'blind' from a
OL,12,Fbag, and players may reject up to
OL,13,Fthree selected conkers."
OL,15,FMr Jakins, who is a mascot at the
OL,16,Fcompetition as well as a competitor,
OL,17,Flives in Northamptonshire so didn't
OL,18,Fjourney far to secure his victory in
OL,19,Fthe men's event.

OL,12,FCompetitors were dressed to impress
