OL,14,Fdamages for defamation, as well as the
OL,15,Fsame amount for a claim of violating
OL,16,Ftrade practices.

OL,6,FAccording to the Associated Press, the
OL,7,F33-page lawsuit accuses the
OL,8,Forganisation of broadcasting a "false,
OL,9,Fdefamatory, deceptive, disparaging,
OL,10,Finflammatory, and malicious depiction
OL,11,Fof President Trump", calling it "a
OL,12,Fbrazen attempt to interfere in and
OL,13,Finfluence" the 2024 US presidential
OL,14,Felection.
OL,16,FIt also accused the BBC of "splicing
OL,17,Ftogether two entirely separate parts
OL,18,Fof President Trump's speech on January
OL,19,F6, 2021" in order to "intentionally
OL,20,Fmisrepresent the meaning of what
