OL,6,FWhooping cough is a bacterial
OL,7,Finfection, which affects the lungs and
OL,8,Fbreathing tubes.
OL,10,FIt can be referred to as the "100-day
OL,11,Fcough" because of how long it can take
OL,12,Fto recover from it, and it spreads
OL,13,Fvery easily.
OL,15,FHealth officials describe whooping
OL,16,Fcough as a "cyclical disease", which
OL,17,Fmeans it peaks every few years. With
OL,18,Fwhooping cough this is every three to
OL,19,Ffive years.

OL,6,FThe UKHSA said the first signs of

OL,8,Fsuch as a runny nose and sore throat -
OL,9,Fbut after about a week, the infection
OL,10,Fcan develop into coughing bouts that
OL,11,Flast for a few minutes and are
OL,12,Ftypically worse at night.
OL,14,FYoung babies may also make a
OL,15,Fdistinctive "whoop" or have difficulty
OL,16,Fbreathing after a bout of coughing,
OL,17,Fthough not all babies make this noise
OL,18,Fwhich means whooping cough can be hard
