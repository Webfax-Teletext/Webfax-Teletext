OL,8,FNaturally the question of value for

OL,10,Fhousehold. But inevitably some pay for

OL,5,FIt also reminds you what value for
OL,6,Fmoney the TV Licence is at barely #3 a
OL,7,Fweek and of the importance of the three
OL,8,Fmain commercial PSBs.
OL,10,FYes, the weekly cost of a TV Licence is
OL,11,Froughly the same as a decent coffee or
OL,12,Fa quality newspaper on a Saturday or
OL,13,FSunday. Its imperfections seem minor

OL,5,FMeanwhile the free-to-air commercial

OL,7,Fis a downturn in advertising.
OL,9,FThis is a real risk. Anyone expressing
