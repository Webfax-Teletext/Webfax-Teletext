OL,4,GTwelve hours into ITV's rebrand,
OL,5,Gthere's a mystery in UTV Land. No
OL,6,Gpromos for local programmes were
OL,7,Gscreened today up until 6pm so far as
OL,8,Gwe can see.
OL,10,FSo we still don't know what's happening
OL,11,Fto UTV as a channel brand.
OL,13,FThe last vestiges of UTV channel
OL,14,Fbranding were in local promotions 
OL,15,Falthough the name is also used during
OL,16,Fthe regional news, weather and some
OL,17,Flocal programmes.

OL,4,FUTV promos used the endboard introduced
OL,5,Fin January 2019 at the same time as the

OL,7,FITV plc regions.
OL,9,FThis design was not updated when
OL,10,Fnetwork trails were refreshed in July
OL,11,F2020.
OL,13,FSo is there a new package for UTV
OL,14,Ftrails? Will local trails include ITV 1
OL,15,Fbranding? Or will local trails avoid
OL,16,Fexplicit branding?
OL,18,FThe possibility of the old design being
OL,19,Fretained for now should not be
OL,20,Fcompletely excluded  ridiculous as it
OL,21,Fmay sound.

OL,4,FInterestingly EPGs still refer to UTV
OL,5,Falthough the entry in other regions has
OL,6,Fbeen updated now to ITV 1. However this
OL,7,Fcould be oversight as the name did not
OL,8,Factively need changed.
OL,10,FThe lack of any local trails so far
OL,11,Ftoday is surprising as UTV has an
OL,12,Fedition of its local documentary series
OL,13,FUp Close tonight and a stand-up comedy
