OL,6,GThis week we were confronted with two
OL,7,Gvisions of the future. One was the
OL,8,Gpossibility that BBC services might
OL,9,Geventually be delivered purely over the
OL,10,Ginternet. The other was the risk that
OL,11,GITV may not renew its Channel 3
OL,12,Glicences and cease to be a public
OL,13,Gservice broadcaster.
OL,15,FSo how realistic or likely are these
OL,16,Fpossibilities?
OL,18,FThe possibility of an "internet only"
OL,19,FBBC needs to be put in context. It was
OL,20,Fnot a threat to switch off Freeview and
OL,21,Fclose major linear services.

OL,6,FRather the director-general's speech
OL,7,Flooked at where technology might
OL,8,Feventually take society to and what the
OL,9,FBBC's role would be.
OL,11,FAn internet-only BBC would only work if
OL,12,Feverybody had access to high speed,
OL,13,Freliable, unmetered broadband.
OL,15,FThere are still rural areas with poor
OL,16,Fconnectivity. There are those who don't
OL,17,Fhave the internet at home on grounds of
OL,18,Fcost. And there are those, especially
OL,19,Fsome older or vulnerable people, who
OL,20,Fsimply do not or cannot go online.

OL,6,FThe growing number of Smart TVs and the
OL,7,Frole of IPlayer inevitably mean the
OL,8,Finternet will become even more
OL,9,Fimportant.
OL,11,FSky, of course, is looking at a future
OL,12,Fwithout dishes through Sky Glass.
OL,14,FIt is not hard to see how more and more
OL,15,Fpeople might principally access BBC
OL,16,Flinear services online rather than off

OL,6,FWell, only if consumers lead

OL,11,FAs long as a significant number of

OL,11,FThese costs include:
