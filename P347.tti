OL,7,F4's first attempt to break the mould of
OL,8,Fbreakfast television came to an end.  
OL,10,FThe Channel 4 Daily included a high

OL,15,FLaunched in a wave of publicity its   
OL,16,Finitial ratings were dismal but, as was
OL,17,Ftypical of Channel 4 at the time, the 
OL,18,Fchannel persevered. The programme won a
OL,19,Floyal audience albeit one much smaller

OL,9,FIt came to an end months before Channel
OL,10,F4 started to sell its own advertising 
OL,11,Fand lost its direct subsidy from ITV. 
OL,12,FThe timing was not coincidental.      
OL,14,FChannel 4 was not prepared to subsidise
OL,15,Fthis particular venture with the ad

OL,7,Fshow aimed at a different audience    
OL,8,Fwhich soon became very popular and

OL,6,FJust as the regional ITV companies sold
OL,7,FChannel 4's advertising time in their 
OL,8,Fareas, so TV-am sold the time between 
OL,9,F6am and 9.25am.                       
OL,11,FTV-am then paid a "fourth channel     
OL,12,Fsubscription" agreed by the IBA  this
OL,13,Feffectively meant TV-am was subsidising
OL,14,FThe Channel 4 Daily. In turn, The     
OL,15,FChannel 4 Daily was not aimed at      
OL,16,FTV-am's target audience and did not
