OL,7,Gthere's a mystery in UTV Land. No
OL,8,Gpromos for local programmes were
OL,9,Gscreened today up until 6pm so far as
OL,10,Gwe can see.
OL,12,
OL,13,FSo we still don't know what's happening
OL,14,Fto UTV as a channel brand.
OL,16,
OL,17,FThe last vestiges of UTV channel
OL,18,Fbranding were in local promotions 
OL,19,Falthough the name is also used during
OL,20,Fthe regional news, weather and some
OL,21,Flocal programmes.

OL,12,FThis design was not updated when

OL,16,
