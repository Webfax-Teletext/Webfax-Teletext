OL,10,Fwas left in a coma for several days.
OL,12,FA series of seizures then left her
OL,13,Fwith aphasia, a condition that affects
OL,14,Falmost half a million people in the UK.
OL,16,FIt is usually sudden, caused by damage
OL,17,Fto the left side of the brain, leading
OL,18,Fto problems with language and
OL,19,Fcommunication - it could be speaking,
