OL,6,FThe project, at the Railway Land
OL,7,FWildlife Trust, is a first of its kind
OL,8,Ffor the UK.
OL,10,FBefore wolves were persecuted to
OL,11,Fextinction in the UK around 1760, they
OL,12,Froamed large areas, typically covering
OL,13,F20km or more each night.
OL,15,FAs they did so they carried wildflower
OL,16,Fand grass seeds in their fur, often
OL,17,Fdepositing them many miles away.

OL,6,FAs the dogs walk through carefully

OL,8,Fthe holes in the packs allow seeds to

OL,11,FBecause the dogs cover more ground

OL,14,Fare spread more widely across the

OL,7,F"This has been such a joyous

OL,9,Fbeen so helpful and positive about the
OL,10,Fproject.
OL,12,F"They've helped to protect and enhance

OL,14,Fget bad press when walking in the

OL,16,Ftell a story in which dogs and their
