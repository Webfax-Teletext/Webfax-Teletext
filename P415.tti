OL,11,FDay, Mr Lovett from Swanage was a
OL,12,Fmember of the Beach Units, crews whose
OL,13,Fjob was to keep soldiers and vehicles
OL,14,Fmoving once they had landed.
OL,16,FHe had undergone rigorous training in
OL,17,FStudland Bay and knew that a beach
OL,18,Fassault was imminent - but didn't know
OL,19,Fthe location.

OL,6,F"We had learnt everything from
OL,7,Fminelaying to mine lifting and
OL,8,Fabseiling down the cliffs at
OL,9,FBournemouth," he said.
OL,11,F"We were told we were training for
OL,12,Fassault landings and going in with
OL,13,Fassault troops and as it happened I
OL,14,Fwent in with the second wave.
OL,16,F"One day we got on the lorries and my
OL,17,Fcompany got into these landing ships.
OL,18,FThe crossing was rough. We were down
OL,19,Fbelow, they wouldn't allow us on deck.

OL,6,F"We didn't know there were also

OL,8,Feventually we came up on top and we
OL,9,Fhad to crouch along the side and then
OL,10,Fwe saw about a mile ahead was the
OL,11,Fbeach and you could hear shellfire and
OL,12,Fthings.
OL,14,F"I was very lucky.
OL,16,F"We came in at high tide and we were
OL,17,Funopposed there. So the first thing
OL,18,Fwas going up to our waist in water so
OL,19,Fwe were soaking wet.

OL,11,FBefore starting work Mr Lovett and his
OL,12,Fcolleagues were told to clear a nearby

OL,15,F"There were dead bodies in the water,"
OL,16,FPeter added.
OL,18,F"We had to push the dead bodies away

OL,11,FBeach groups were the only troops
OL,12,Fallowed to remain on the beach. They

OL,17,FMr Lovett said: "We had learned to lay
