OL,7,Freligious festivals into one to create
OL,8,Fa 'Chreaster Egg', causing a divide in
OL,9,Fopinion among shoppers and members of
OL,10,Fthe Christian community.
OL,12,FAldi says the Dairyfine Hollow
OL,13,FCharacter Eggs combine Christmas,
OL,14,Fwhich is seven weeks away, and Easter,
OL,15,Fwhich is not until April.
