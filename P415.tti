OL,7,FThe Leader of the Liberal Democrats,

OL,9,Finstruct the Environment Agency to
OL,10,Fclear up hundreds of tonnes of waste
OL,11,Ffound in a flip-tip in a field between
OL,12,Fthe River Cherwell and the A34 in
OL,13,FKidlington, Oxfordshire.
OL,15,FDavey said he is "totally shocked that

OL,17,Fdo it in the first place and allowed
