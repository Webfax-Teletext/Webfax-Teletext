OL,6,FA mother from Salisbury has given her
OL,7,Fson a second chance at life after
OL,8,Fdonating him one of her kidneys.
OL,10,FGill Raggett, 70, didn't think twice
OL,11,Fwhen Luke's health started to
OL,12,Fdeteriorate and she donated despite
OL,13,Fbeing told years earlier that she was
OL,14,Funlikely to be able to do so.
OL,16,FLuke Raggett, 32, was diagnosed with
OL,17,Fpolycystic kidney disease (PKD) aged
OL,18,F15 and his kidney function steadily
OL,19,Fdeclined to the point where he needed
OL,20,Fa transplant.
