OL,6,FAn Oxfordshire farmer has described
OL,7,Fthe Autumn Budget as a 'kick in the

OL,9,FChancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced
OL,10,Fan inheritance tax of 20% for farming
OL,11,Festates worth more than #1 million.
OL,13,FJames Florey, a fourth-generation
OL,14,Ffarmer from Northmoor, near Oxford,
OL,15,Ftook on his dad's farm and hopes to
OL,16,Fpass it on to his daughters, if they
OL,17,Fwould like to continue the family

OL,6,FChurchills Farm, in the West

OL,11,FThe cattle and sheep rearer says they
OL,12,Fare already in a 'volatile industry'
OL,13,Fand the tax will have a massive impact.
OL,15,F"In an industry that is effectively

OL,3,CFarmer claims budget is 'kick in the

OL,6,FIn the Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget,
OL,7,Fannounced yesterday, farmers will need
OL,8,Fto pay a 20% inheritance tax on assets
OL,9,Fover #1m, if they chose to give their
OL,10,Fland to somebody else when they pass
OL,11,Faway.
OL,13,FHowever, Foley isn't happy as he
OL,14,Fbelieves that the new tax means he
OL,15,Fwould potentially have to sell land to
OL,16,Fpay a tax bill which could mean the
OL,17,Fend of his family's business.
OL,19,F"There is no way in the world that we
OL,20,Fwill have capital to afford to pay
OL,21,Fthat type of bill.

OL,8,Fthe land to pay the tax bill which
OL,9,Fjust breaks up the family farm."
OL,11,FIn a public appearance, Reeves said
OL,12,Fthat this will not affect most small
OL,13,Ffarmers.
OL,15,FShe said: "73% of farms will not be
