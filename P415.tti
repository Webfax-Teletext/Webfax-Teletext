OL,11,Fwith a crew of seven, Mr Hammond's

OL,14,Fattacking enemy installations in
OL,15,FNorthern France.
OL,17,FBefore that he had been on bombing

OL,6,FHe said: "It got to one point I will
OL,7,Fbe honest, I didn't think I was going
OL,8,Fto make it. Because of the losses.
OL,9,FOther crews came in and left - never
OL,10,Fcame back.
OL,12,F"An air gunner of course is the eyes
OL,13,Fof the aircraft. The point is you
OL,14,Fsearch and search and search for enemy
OL,15,Fnight fighters because they were the

OL,6,F"We were allocated around that period

OL,8,FHammond said.
OL,10,F"I did actually five operations in
OL,11,Feight days. These were all sorts of
OL,12,Ftargets to help the lads. Primarily
OL,13,Fthe defences of the Germans. Big
OL,14,Frailway junctions. Anything you could
OL,15,Fdo to cut off transport.
OL,17,F"The build up was some targets near
OL,18,FParis. Some further inland. But they
OL,19,Fweren't actually (Normandy).
