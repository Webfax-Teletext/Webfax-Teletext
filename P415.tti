OL,7,FMany places along the coast have

OL,10,Fbe more to come.
OL,12,FLandlady of the Woolpack, Barbara
OL,13,FSmith, told ITV Meridian she thought
OL,14,Fthey'd seen the worst of it.
OL,16,F"We knew we were going to have to rip

OL,12,F"We really thought that was the end of

OL,9,FThe last time it happened, the cause

OL,14,FBut this time it appears floodwater is
