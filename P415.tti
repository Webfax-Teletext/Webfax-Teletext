OL,6,FOne of England's most important chalk
OL,7,Fstreams has suffered a "decade of
OL,8,Fdecline", according to a conservation
OL,9,Fcharity.
OL,11,FWildFish has found a fall in wildlife
OL,12,Fduring a survey of five sites on the
OL,13,FRiver Avon - which flows through
OL,14,FWiltshire and Hampshire.
OL,16,FOver the past 10 years it saw a
OL,17,Fsignificant decline in wildlife such
OL,18,Fas freshwater shrimps, mayflies,
OL,19,Fcaddisflies, beetles and aquatic bugs.
