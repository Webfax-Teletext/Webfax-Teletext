OL,6,FThe woodland at Bethersden, near
OL,7,FAshford, was the victim of illegal
OL,8,Fdumping of 'up to 20 to 30 trucks a
OL,9,Fday' in July 2023, with surveys
OL,10,Festimating that 35,000 tonnes of
OL,11,Fprocessed waste was left on the site.
OL,13,FHowever, as the nettles have grown
OL,14,Facross the site, Kent Wildlife Trust
OL,15,Fhave warned of potentially toxic
OL,16,Fmaterial which they say needs to
OL,17,Fremoved as soon as possible.

OL,11,F"Anything like heavy metals, asbestos,

OL,14,FResidents and campaigners have also
