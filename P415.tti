OL,6,F"Quite a lot of marshy country so
OL,7,Fthere weren't tanks around.
OL,9,F"But there was a division of German
OL,10,Ftroops who consisted of veterans who
OL,11,Fhad fought on the Russian front, and
OL,12,Fthere were occasional clashes with
OL,13,Fthem because they retreated back from

OL,11,F"We went out on a regular patrol
