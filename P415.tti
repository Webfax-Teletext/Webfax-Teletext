OL,6,FA museum in Oxfordshire, which has
OL,7,Fbeen open for 85 years, will have to
OL,8,Fclose down if the local council goes
OL,9,Fahead with a plan to axe its funding.
OL,11,FBanbury Museum & Gallery will shut its
OL,12,Fdoors if Cherwell District Council
OL,13,Fsigns off on a decision to cancel its

OL,16,FThe Museum Director, Simon Townsend
OL,17,Fsaid: "The risk is really severe"
OL,19,F"Make no mistake, if we have no grant
