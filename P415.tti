OL,7,FWhen 10-year-old Sophie Fairall was
OL,8,Fill in hospital with cancer, her
OL,9,Fmother Charlotte was at her bedside
OL,10,Fday and night. It meant she often
OL,11,Fstruggled to get regular meals and
OL,12,Ffind other essentials.
OL,14,F"I was a parent on the ward,
OL,15,Fstruggling to find food, struggling to
OL,16,Ffind even things like sanitary
OL,17,Fproducts," said Charlotte. "Sophie
OL,18,Fused to say to me 'Mum you're in
OL,19,Fhospital because I'm unwell, why are
OL,20,Fthey not feeding you?"
