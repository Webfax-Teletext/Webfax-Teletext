OL,11,Fmuch loved son, father, brother,
OL,12,Funcle, and friend.
OL,14,F"Dale's life was taken at the hands of
OL,15,FHeywood. The jury completely rejected
OL,16,FHeywood's account that she was acting
OL,17,Fin self-defence, and there is
OL,18,Fabsolutely no evidence to suggest that
OL,19,FMr Bond attacked Heywood.

OL,16,Fstabbing him. One of the blows caused
