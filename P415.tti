OL,6,FOn Friday, the inquest at Kent and
OL,7,FMedway Coroner's Court in Maidstone,
OL,8,Fheard that if Archie had been
OL,9,Fdiagnosed earlier he would "almost

OL,11,Fdid".
OL,13,FArea coroner Sarah Clarke said: "I
OL,14,Fhave no doubt earlier recognition and
OL,15,Fdiagnosis of a very rare heart
OL,16,Fcondition would have made a difference
OL,17,Fto the outcome for Archie.
