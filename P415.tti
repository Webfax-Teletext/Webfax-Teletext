OL,12,FThe company, based in Winnersh, is not

OL,16,FBut campaigners argue there's a moral

OL,6,FFormer employees Jane Foley and John

OL,9,Ftime came they discovered their
OL,10,FHewlett Packard Enterprise pensions
OL,11,Fhadn't increased in line with
OL,12,Finflation - and so now face an

OL,15,FJane said, "The impact on me is that

OL,17,Fit to be. Literally the money that I
OL,18,Fhave from my state and my digital
