OL,6,FDefence lawyers argued O'Sullivan
OL,7,Fcould not have caused the death of Ms
OL,8,FDhillon because the crash was
OL,9,F"inevitable" given that the car was
OL,10,Fstationary in the fast lane and the
OL,11,Fsmart motorway was not displaying any

OL,14,FWhile acknowledging "something went
