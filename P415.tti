OL,6,FCarbon monoxide poisoning is typically
OL,7,Fcaused by a faulty boiler, cooker or
OL,8,Fheater giving off a deadly gas, which
OL,9,Fyou can't see or smell.
OL,11,FApproximately 30,000 people die every
OL,12,Fyear from carbon monoxide poisoning,
OL,13,Faccording to The Lancet.
OL,15,FCathy said: "It is not something
OL,16,Fpeople think about automatically. It
OL,17,Fcertainly was not on my radar and not
OL,18,Fon Hudson's. It is absolutely
OL,19,Fimportant, completely."
