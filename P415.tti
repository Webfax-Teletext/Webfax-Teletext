OL,6,FA man who has been ordered to remove a
OL,7,Fstructure in his garden by the council
OL,8,Fhas hired a crane to lift it off the
OL,9,Fground to show its moveability.
OL,11,FSteve Holden had applied to put a shed
OL,12,Fup outside his house in Hastings, but
OL,13,Fhe was turned down.
OL,15,FHe then found a builder who said he
OL,16,Fcould make it in a way it can be
OL,17,Ftreated as a caravan in planning terms
OL,18,Fand would not need council approval.

OL,6,FHe has now been served with an
OL,7,Fenforcement notice by Hastings Borough
OL,8,FCouncil to remove the structure.
OL,10,FHomeowner, Steve Holden said: "(The
OL,11,Fbuilder) assured me that he could
OL,12,Fbuild a moveable structure that didn't
OL,13,Frequire planning permission.
OL,15,F"I don't want to be in dispute with
OL,16,Fthe council, so I figured I'd got the
OL,17,Fright solution, but apparently not.
OL,19,F"The council eventually served me,
OL,20,Fafter a long process and a couple of
OL,21,Fappeals, with an enforcement notice.

OL,6,F"We managed to lift it about 18 inches

OL,12,FThe builder says because the structure
OL,13,Fis moveable, it should be treated as a

OL,16,F"It's not a shed because there's
