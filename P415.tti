OL,6,FA young man from Hampshire, who's been
OL,7,Fdiagnosed with a terminal brain

OL,11,FGeorge Hatt from Winchester is just
OL,12,F24, but he was told this year that he
OL,13,Fhad only 18 months to live.
OL,15,FNow, along with his family and
OL,16,Ffriends, he's determined to make the
OL,17,Fmost of every moment, and raise money
OL,18,Ffor others in the same situation.

OL,7,Fand to anyone that's not news you want
OL,8,Fto hear, it takes you by storm. But
OL,9,Ffor me, I had to stay strong for the
OL,10,Fpeople around me. Because at the end
OL,11,Fof the day, after 18 months, they're
OL,12,Fthe ones who have to deal with it, not
OL,13,Fme."
OL,15,FMost of the tumour, which was the size
OL,16,Fof an orange has been removed, but it
OL,17,Fdamaged an eye, and since then he's
OL,18,Fbeen undergoing gruelling rounds of
OL,19,Fchemo and radiotherapy in Winchester.
