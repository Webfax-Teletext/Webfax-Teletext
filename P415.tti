OL,7,FDr Mark Young, lead author of the

OL,11,Fmirrors that of cetaceans, reducing
OL,12,Fduring their semiaquatic phases and
OL,13,Fthen diminishing further as they

OL,16,F"Both groups also developed extra-

OL,7,F"But whereas the cetacean's sinus
OL,8,Fsystem aids pressure regulation around

OL,10,Fexpansive snout sinus systems of
OL,11,Fmetriorhynchids precluded it from
OL,12,Fdiving deeply.
OL,14,F"That's because at greater depths, air
OL,15,Fwithin the sinuses would compress,
OL,16,Fcausing discomfort, damage, or even
OL,17,Fcollapse in the snout due to its
OL,18,Finability to withstand or equalise the
