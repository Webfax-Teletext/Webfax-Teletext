OL,14,FBut the Care Quality Commission (CQC)
OL,15,Ffound that its staff were

OL,6,FThe CQC first inspected Blossoms Care

OL,9,Fclosing it in the process.
OL,11,FThe company appealed the decision but
OL,12,Fa second inspection in November - when
OL,13,Fit was caring for 15 people - found
OL,14,Feven more issues with its services,
OL,15,Fincluding not knowing that three of

OL,9,FOverall, the CQC said the home had

OL,12,FAmong the issues was a lack of
OL,13,Fawareness of residents' weight-loss.
OL,14,FIn one case, the watchdog said a
