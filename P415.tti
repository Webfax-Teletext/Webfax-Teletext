OL,8,F"Arromanches was the main part where

OL,5,F"On this particular morning we were in
OL,6,Fa lane and an infantry sergeant
OL,7,Fapproached us and said he was being
OL,8,Fheld up by something, probably a tank
OL,9,Fso we took him on board to show us
OL,10,Fwhere he was having the problem.
OL,12,F"We moved down the lane and suddenly
OL,13,Fthere was a very large thud at the
OL,14,Ffront of our tank and we tried to
OL,15,Freverse and get out of trouble.
OL,17,F"But another shell arrived and this
OL,18,Ftime it penetrated and landed round
OL,19,Fand about my feet and there was an
OL,20,Fexplosion.

OL,5,F"It became absolutely essential that
OL,6,Feverybody got out of the tank.
OL,8,F"The crew all left alright but the
OL,9,Fsergeant obviously didn't know what
OL,10,Fwas happening and before I could get
OL,11,Fout I had to get him out of the
OL,12,Fcockpit and I then managed to crawl
OL,13,Faway from the tank which was beginning
OL,14,Fto get a bit hot.
OL,16,F"In the time I was getting out I had
OL,17,Freceived burns to my right hand and I
OL,18,Fsaw my right leg was completely
OL,19,Fsmashed below the knee and I had lost
OL,20,Fthe front of my left foot.
