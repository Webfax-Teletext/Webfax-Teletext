OL,10,F"And I am serious now, it was horrid.

OL,6,F"They hadn't advanced all that far. We
OL,7,Ftook over after Michael Wittman had
OL,8,Fdecimated the Fife and Forfars. He
OL,9,Fknocked out at least Cromwells and a
OL,10,Fcouple of scout cars. And we took over
OL,11,Ffrom that regiment.
OL,13,F"I was just a driver and I had to
OL,14,Fdrive this Cromwell. You must
OL,15,Funderstand that your visibility in a
OL,16,Ftank is seriously curtailed and you
OL,17,Fjust go where you are told to go.
OL,19,F"Each one has got his headset on and
OL,20,Fyou hear the orders. 'Go left, go
OL,21,Fleft. Put your foot down, Stop.'
