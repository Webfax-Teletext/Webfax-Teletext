OL,6,FIt's one of the UK's most iconic

OL,8,Fmade to transform Brighton into a
OL,9,Fsandy beach, echoing the dunes of

OL,12,FSparking a debate amongst hundreds of
OL,13,Flocals, one resident described the
OL,14,Fsandy beach as 'the only thing
OL,15,FBrighton is missing.'
OL,17,FBrighton's shingle beach stretches for
OL,18,F5.4 miles and has a flat sandy
OL,19,Fforeshore which becomes exposed at low

OL,6,FOne resident said: "It's like that
OL,7,Fbecause the coastline has been formed
OL,8,Fover hundreds of thousands of years
OL,9,Fand after the ice age cut through to

OL,11,Fbeaches and the chalk cliffs are part
OL,12,Fof it. You'd need to change evolution.
OL,13,FIt's impossible to replace the pebbles
OL,14,Fwith sand."
OL,16,FAnother added: "Leave our beach alone
OL,17,F,all brightonians know and are used to
OL,18,Four pebbles if you don't like it go to
OL,19,FCamber Sands."
