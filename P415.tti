OL,7,Fpioneering, life-saving brain surgery
OL,8,Fin October has made a "very
OL,9,Fencouraging" recovery after six weeks
OL,10,Fof rehabilitation.
OL,12,FBoki became the first brown bear on
OL,13,Frecord to have brain surgery,
OL,14,Faccording to Wildwood Trust.
OL,16,FThe two-year-old, who lives at
OL,17,FWildwood Trust, near Canterbury, Kent,
OL,18,Fhad been suffering from seizures which
OL,19,Fwere believed to be caused by
OL,20,Fhydrocephalus (fluid on the brain).
