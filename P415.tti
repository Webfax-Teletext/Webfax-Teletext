OL,6,FA badger had to be rescued from a
OL,7,Fbedroom in Ryde on the Isle of Wight
OL,8,Fyesterday (14 February).
OL,10,FThe animal had fallen from the wall at
OL,11,Fthe end of the garden and was then
OL,12,Ftrapped in the courtyard area.
OL,14,FShe then chewed through the wooden
OL,15,Fback door and got into the kitchen
OL,16,Fwhere she raided the cupboards for
OL,17,Ffood and headed upstairs to the
OL,18,Fbedroom.

OL,6,F"She was sleeping in an upturned bin
OL,7,Fwhen I went into the bedroom, I
OL,8,Fwatched her walk around the room to
OL,9,Fmake sure she wasn't injured and then
OL,10,Fcaught her and put her into our badger
OL,11,Fcage and gave her a check over.
OL,13,F"She was a nice healthy weight so I
OL,14,Fasked a neighbour to help me carry the
OL,15,Fcage down the stairs and out onto the
OL,16,Fpavement where I gave her another
OL,17,Fcheck over and gave her a few minutes
OL,18,Fto get her bearings and then opened
OL,19,Fthe cage.
