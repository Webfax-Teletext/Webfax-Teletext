OL,7,FThe profile of the course is extremely
OL,8,Fdifficult. The Seven Sisters is so up
OL,9,Fand down. It's extremely difficult on
OL,10,Fthe legs. People's legs towards the
OL,11,Fend of the event anyway are like jelly
OL,12,Fand then soon as they get to Cuckmere
OL,13,Fthey have to face the Seven Sisters.
OL,14,FPeople might be thinking 'oh shall I
OL,15,Fgive up, shall I stop?' but when

OL,17,Fthat amazing scenery, it spurs them on.
