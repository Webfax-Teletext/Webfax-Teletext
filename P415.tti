OL,7,Fthey are calling an "intergalactic
OL,8,Fmystery" of how some of the universe's
OL,9,Fbiggest galaxies were formed, in a new
OL,10,Fstudy.
OL,12,FGiant galaxies, known as 'elliptical
OL,13,Fgalaxies', look similar to bulging
OL,14,Ffootballs compared with the flat disc
OL,15,Fof the Milky Way. The question of how
OL,16,Fthey emerged have been at the centre
OL,17,Fof research for decades.
OL,19,FNow, researchers at the University of
OL,20,FSouthampton say they are close to
OL,21,Fforming an answer to that question.
