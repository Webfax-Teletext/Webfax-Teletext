OL,6,Frambling house.
OL,8,F"There were quite a lot of us there,
OL,9,Fand we learned how to work a radio.
OL,10,FHow to work interception and which
OL,11,Fknobs to twiddle - and also, of
OL,12,Fcourse, we learned quite a lot of
OL,13,FGerman naval phraseology, such as
OL,14,F'Full speed aft'".

OL,5,FIt read: "This base collected Very
OL,6,FHigh Frequency (VHF) communications
OL,7,Ffrom Germany directing aircraft or
OL,8,Ffast moving E-boats in the English
OL,9,FChannel. VHF has a very short range
OL,10,Fwhich meant that German linguists,
OL,11,Fmainly young women, were sent to the
OL,12,Ffront line to live log the
OL,13,Fcommunications. This type of
OL,14,Finterception had never been done
OL,15,Fbefore for voice communications and
OL,16,Fthe tactical nature of this job meant
OL,17,Fthat every day the information
OL,18,Fcollected by these young women was
OL,19,Fhelping to protect British pilots and
OL,20,Fsailors. German forces would try to
OL,21,Fcapture British pilots downed over the
OL,22,FChannel and information from Abbots
OL,23,FCliff House would have helped to save
OL,24,Fsome British pilots during the war."

OL,12,Fhappening and we had unusually some
OL,13,Fnaval officers there and eventually
OL,14,Fthey did tell us that it was happening.
