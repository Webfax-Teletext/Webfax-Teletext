OL,6,FHe said: "On the evening before D-Day
OL,7,Fwe set sail from Portsmouth to France.
OL,9,F"Coronation was just an old fishing
OL,10,Ftrawler that had been salvaged from
OL,11,Fthe shipyard and went into the docks
OL,12,Fin London and was refurbished to a
OL,13,Fcertain extent and then we went on to
OL,14,FD-Day.
OL,16,F"We were more or less a little ship to
OL,17,Fgo round and about. We had no
OL,18,Farmaments on board. We had no radio.
OL,19,FNo signalmen, nothing. A runabout
OL,20,Freally. We didn't go into deep water
OL,21,Freally.

OL,6,F"If one of the ships had something to
OL,7,Ftake to another ship, say if it was a
OL,8,Fbig ship and couldn't get in or out we
OL,9,Fused to take it."
OL,11,FAn important job at night was to
OL,12,Fsearch for parachute mines which would
OL,13,Flater be cleared by minesweepers.
OL,15,F"We did more duties at night than we
OL,16,Fdid in the daytime," Mr Harmer said.
OL,18,F"They had these things that were

OL,20,Fthey had to sink to make a harbour for

OL,6,F"Our old skipper, an old fishing
OL,7,Fskipper, said he wasn't going in there
OL,8,Fbecause of the weather and we might
OL,9,Fsink. We used to just steam into the
OL,10,Fwind because it was a team engine, not
OL,11,Fdiesel.
OL,13,F"All those ships that did go inside
OL,14,Fgot washed up on the shore.
OL,16,F"Once we stopped for lunch and there
OL,17,Fwas a boat. The back of it was hollow
OL,18,Fand they used to make submarine nets
OL,19,Fon the back. The tide changed and it
OL,20,Fbrought up a mine and it sunk the ship.
