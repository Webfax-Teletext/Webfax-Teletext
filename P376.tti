OL,6,FThis matters. A lot. It's the first
OL,7,Ftime publicly owned trains have run in
OL,8,Fthe Midlands in around 30 years, a
OL,9,Fsymbolic shift in a region that's long

OL,13,FBut let's be honest about

OL,15,Fexpect instant change.
OL,17,FThe branding will evolve, the

OL,10,Fpassengers, and delivers the high

OL,13,FThe core argument for public ownership
OL,14,Fin a nutshell: less money leaking out
OL,15,Fin fees, more joined-up control, and
OL,16,Ffewer excuses when things go wrong.

OL,15,FBecause this is a huge test for the
