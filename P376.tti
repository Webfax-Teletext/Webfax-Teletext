OL,12,FGryfice is a historic town just a few
OL,13,Fmiles from the Baltic Sea, and it's
OL,14,Fhome to Katarzyna Zablocka.
OL,16,FAt 25, Katarzyna has already suffered
OL,17,Funimaginable pain in her life, but
OL,18,Fshown not just a determination to get
OL,19,Fto the truth, but an enduring love for
OL,20,Fthe mother she lost so tragically.
