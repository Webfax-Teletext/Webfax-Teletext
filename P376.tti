OL,3,CXL Bully breed: 'It's the owners not
OL,4,Cthe dogs'
OL,6,FAn XL bully owner from Worcestershire
OL,7,Fhas been organising walks for the
OL,8,Fowners of the breed to help adapt to
OL,9,Fthe new rules and regulations.
OL,11,FLily Collins, who lives in Bromsgrove,
OL,12,Fhas initiated the walks to provide a
OL,13,Fsupportive community for owners of
OL,14,Fwhat she says is a 'misunderstood'
OL,15,Fbreed.
OL,17,FIt has followed a spate of attacks by
OL,18,Fdogs of that breed, some of which
OL,19,Fproved fatal - leading to the
OL,20,Fgovernment introducing new measures in
OL,21,FDecember last year.

OL,6,FThe measures dictate that XL bullies

OL,10,FLily says the walks offer a platform
OL,11,Ffor responsible XL bully owners to
OL,12,Fconnect and arrange meet ups for their
OL,13,Fdogs, while adhering to the rules and

OL,6,FLily said: "The reason I have started
OL,7,Fthese XL bully pack walks is because I
OL,8,Fbelieve it is a great opportunity to
OL,9,Fallow other dog owners who own this
OL,10,Fbreed to connect with one another

OL,15,Fbully owners is really comforting but
OL,16,Falso really sad, the breed is becoming
OL,17,Fextinct due to a percentage of
OL,18,Firresponsible dog owners who have
