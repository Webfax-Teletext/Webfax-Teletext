OL,7,FAn inquest had been due to start on

OL,9,FChristmas because of delays in
OL,10,Fdisclosure of information to Miss
OL,11,FCusack's family.
OL,13,FAt a hearing today, the inquest was
OL,14,Fscheduled for this summer.
OL,16,FCoroner Sophie Cartwright said she
OL,17,Fintended to set aside two weeks from
OL,18,FJune 29 to ensure the inquest could

OL,20,Ffamily had already "waited a long
