OL,6,FHere are some of their tips for those
OL,7,Fhot dogs:
OL,9,FRachel Frost from Birmingham Dogs Home
OL,10,Fsaid there are signs that you can look
OL,11,Fout for if your dog is too hot or at
OL,12,Frisk from the warm weather.
OL,14,FShe said: "So they'll do excessive
OL,15,Fpanting, they might collapse, lots of
OL,16,Fdrinking as well. So it is just really
OL,17,Fimportant that because they can't
OL,18,Fsweat, they can't control their own
OL,19,Ftemperature.

OL,6,F"So it is really important to make
OL,7,Fsure they are cool, we're sat in the
OL,8,Fshade and we're out early, so they'll
OL,9,Fbe absolutely happy with that because
OL,10,Fthe heat does take it out of them, so
OL,11,Fyou'll find they are a lot more tired.
OL,13,F"So they probably don't want to go on
OL,14,Fa big long walk during the midday, so
OL,15,Fchange your routine, it is important
OL,16,Fto make sure to just get out early."
OL,18,FRachel added that owners can even
OL,19,Fcreate their own frozen treats for
OL,20,Ftheir dogs. She said that it can be
OL,21,Fdone with water, treats or their food.

OL,6,FShe said: "So just freeze it in maybe
OL,7,Fa plastic cup that you have got, put
OL,8,Fthe water and the treat, put it in the
OL,9,Ffreezer and when you get it out, take
OL,10,Fthe plastic cup off and the dogs will
OL,11,Fabsolutely love it.
OL,13,F"You can get lots of flavoured items
OL,14,Ffrom stores as well, so there is lots
OL,15,Fof things you can do, that you don't
OL,16,Fhave to spend loads of money on, just
OL,17,Fkeep it fun, put some ice cubes in
OL,18,Fwater as well, so they migth be able
OL,19,Fto get those out and have a little
OL,20,Fplay with them, so there is lots you
OL,21,Fcan do."
