OL,6,FIt was 2014 when they first started
OL,7,Fprotesting against these plans, when
OL,8,Fthe company IGas announced that it
OL,9,Fwanted to drill for shell gas at a
OL,10,Fformer RAF base nearby.
OL,12,FResidents were concerned about the
OL,13,Fimpacts on traffic and also the
OL,14,Fenvironmental concerns.
OL,16,FOne of the main concerns about Springs
OL,17,FRoad had been the impact of shale gas
OL,18,Foperators on rare and threatened
OL,19,Fwildlife on the Misson Carr wetland
OL,20,Ffen, including all five species of
OL,21,FBritish owls.
