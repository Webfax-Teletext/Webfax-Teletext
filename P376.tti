OL,6,FSchool librarian Keren, 55, from
OL,7,FClayton, said: "We had arranged the
OL,8,Fcollection. The delivery drivers
OL,9,Farrived early and I was at an
OL,10,Fappointment. I called my husband to
OL,11,Fsee if he could nip round and meet
OL,12,Fthem.
OL,14,F"I told my husband what they could
OL,15,Ftake. I told him 'Don't let them take
OL,16,Fthe dolls' house'. He phoned me while
OL,17,Fhe was there with the men to clarify.

OL,6,F"As far as I was concerned, that was
OL,7,Fdone. I didn't go to my mum's house at
OL,8,Fall. It wasn't until a week later when
OL,9,Fthe estate agent said a buyer wanted
OL,10,Fto look around the house that I went
OL,11,Fin and the dolls' house wasn't there.
OL,12,FI thought we'd had a break-in.
OL,14,F"I called the Salvation Army which
OL,15,Ftold me that the house had sold at the
OL,16,Fshop within an hour. It was heart-
OL,17,Fbreaking."
OL,19,FKeren has since turned detective to
