OL,9,Fturned off, after he was involved in a

OL,13,FDr Steph Alger's son Etienne, known as
OL,14,FJustin, was 18 when he lost control of
OL,15,Fhis car. He was driving at 66mph,
OL,16,Fwhich was only a little over the legal
OL,17,Flimit, but the road was wet, he took a
OL,18,Fcorner too quickly, and he had a nail
OL,19,Fin his tyre.
