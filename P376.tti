OL,6,FHe told ITV News Central: "One of the
OL,7,Fmain reasons is we are having trouble
OL,8,Frecruiting on-call firefighters who do
OL,9,Fform a major backbone of our fire and
OL,10,Frescue service. We are not meeting our
OL,11,Ftarget response times and we're trying
OL,12,Fto put resources in the right place at

OL,15,FOn-call firefighters are part-time
OL,16,Fcrew who are based from retained fire
OL,17,Fstations around the county. When they
OL,18,Fare available around their other jobs,
OL,19,Fthey respond mainly to local incidents.

OL,3,C'Grave concerns' over proposals to

OL,6,FUnder the current proposals, their
OL,7,Frole would go and the retained
OL,8,Fstations around the county would be
OL,9,Fused much less frequently. Instead
OL,10,Fthere would be 'surge' teams of
OL,11,Fexperienced firefighters who could be
OL,12,Fcalled on within a couple of hours to
OL,13,Fhelp when demand was high.
OL,15,FShift patterns and the number of

OL,18,FTristan Ashby, from the Fire and
OL,19,FRescue Services Association, said he
OL,20,Fis worried about the proposals.

OL,6,FHe says: "We have grave concerns with
OL,7,Fregards to the proposals for
OL,8,FWarwickshire, not least because of the
OL,9,Fnumber of appliances that are going

OL,12,Fduring the day, but also because of

OL,16,FThe change in the number, and

OL,6,FThe increased wait times are worrying

OL,10,FBill Fleming lives in Bidford-on-Avon,
OL,11,Fwhere there is currently a retained

OL,15,Fovernight, that's a big concern to us.

OL,6,FJill Machado shares those concerns,
OL,7,Fsaying: "We're right at the end of the

OL,9,FWorcestershire and Gloucestershire but
OL,10,Fwe can't guarantee that so we're

OL,15,FBut the Chief Fire Officer says that

OL,6,FBen Brook told ITV News Central: "What

OL,8,Fpurpose, based on evidence, putting
OL,9,Fresources where they are going to make
OL,10,Fthe most difference. So there are some

OL,12,Fhave 85 life and property incidents a

OL,14,Fare 2 or 3 of those incidents. Clearly
OL,15,Fwe want to get there as quickly as
