OL,5,FJanuary to April has been the worst
OL,6,Ffirst quarter for strawberry farms in
OL,7,Fthe last four years. But with April
OL,8,Fbeing it's sunniest in the UK since
OL,9,Frecords began 115 years ago, farmers
OL,10,Fhave enjoyed seeing an increase in
OL,11,Ftheir crops' size, number, and quality.
OL,13,FSimon Clarke, a second generation
OL,14,Ffarmer of the family-run business
OL,15,Fsaid: "The sun we've had over the last
OL,16,F4-5 weeks, coupled with the cooler
OL,17,Fnights, has led to more sugar being
OL,18,Fproduced in our strawberries which has
OL,19,Fled to that sweet taste."
