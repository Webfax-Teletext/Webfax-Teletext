OL,8,Falways been kind. From near in , he
OL,9,Fcame to England to work after his wife
OL,10,Fpassed away.
OL,12,FHe found a job as a welder and was
OL,13,Fwith one of his two sons, but then

OL,16,Fsadly passed away.

OL,7,FBeata is finding that Poles and other

OL,9,Fhere, worked and paid taxes, are

OL,7,FThe question many will of course ask

OL,10,FBeata put it best when she said that

OL,13,Fand often have nothing left in Poland.
