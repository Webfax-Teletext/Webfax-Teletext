OL,9,Ffoot drain in Leicester.
OL,11,FResidents on Glenfield Road had heard
OL,12,Fbarking coming from inside a storm
OL,13,Fdrain.
OL,15,FWhen they lifted off the cover, they
OL,16,Fcould see the cub approximately six
OL,17,Ffeet down (1.8m) at the bottom.
OL,19,FThey tried to help him climb out, but
OL,20,Fit was so deep that the cub had no way
OL,21,Fto escape.

OL,7,FHis mum could be seen pacing anxiously

OL,13,FRSPCA Inspector Beckie Harlock said
OL,14,Fthey weren't sure how the cub got down

OL,16,Fso they contacted Leicestershire Fire
OL,17,F& Rescue Service.
OL,19,FOne of their crew lowered themselves
OL,20,Fdown the drain and was able to get the
OL,21,Ffox in a carrier.

OL,12,F"Our plan worked. Video images from a
