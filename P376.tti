OL,4,Cdue to 'crisis' in maternity care
OL,6,FA midwife who works in a Midlands
OL,7,Fhospital has said there is a "crisis"
OL,8,Fin maternity care and is calling for
OL,9,Furgent change.
OL,11,FThe whistleblower, who spoke
OL,12,Fexclusively to ITV News Central, said
OL,13,Feven before stepping into work she
OL,14,Ffeels anxious about what lies ahead.
OL,16,FShe claimed that staff put on a
OL,17,F"circus show" when they receive a
OL,18,Fvisit from the Care Quality Commission
OL,19,F(CQC) and she doesn't believe any
OL,20,Finvestigation will show the true
OL,21,Fextent of failings.

OL,7,Fanxiety, it's feeling sick," the
OL,8,Fmidwife, who asked to be anonymous,
OL,9,Ftold ITV News Central.
OL,11,F"You start the shift anxious because
OL,12,Fyou don't know what's going to come

OL,19,Fwith maternity units overstretched and
OL,20,Funderstaffed.
