OL,6,FScientists in Nottingham have
OL,7,Fdeveloped an "ultra-fast" test which
OL,8,Fcan slash the time patients have to
OL,9,Fwait to find out what type of brain
OL,10,Ftumour they have.
OL,12,FPatients usually wait six to eight
OL,13,Fweeks to find out the type of brain
OL,14,Ftumour.
OL,16,FBut experts have found the new "game-
OL,17,Fchanging" tool, which assesses the DNA
OL,18,Ffrom a tumour sample, can achieve this
OL,19,Fin around two hours.
