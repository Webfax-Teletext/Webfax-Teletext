OL,4,Cof UTV content
OL,6,GA couple of weeks ago I reflected on
OL,7,Gwhether the last parts of UTV's
OL,8,Gdistinct visual identity may disappear
OL,9,Gby stealth.
OL,11,FUTV's main news programmes and weather
OL,12,Fdo not carry explicit ITV branding
OL,13,Falthough in every other respect they
OL,14,Flook identical to the news and weather
OL,15,Fin other regions.
OL,17,FThen, sure enough, another change by
OL,18,Fstealth happened.

OL,6,FNew images have been created for ITV

OL,8,Finstance on the regional pages on
OL,9,Fitv.com/news.
OL,11,FThe change itself is no big deal. It
OL,12,Fwas simply time to freshen up the
OL,13,Fimages. Perhaps presenters have
OL,14,Fchanged in some areas or, dare I say
OL,15,Fit, some may now look a little older.
OL,17,FBut in UTV land the innocuous change
OL,18,Fis a little more noteworthy.

OL,12,FIt is worth noting too that the online
