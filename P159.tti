OL,6,GIt is still early days for the

OL,8,Gearly indications are that the
OL,9,Gprogramme is proving a success.
OL,11,FAs I anticipated, the first half hour
OL,12,Fof the programme has barely changed `
OL,13,Fbeyond the move to Salford and the use
OL,14,Fof the Breakfast set.
OL,16,FEven so, the lack of a traditional
OL,17,Fdesk and the use of the Breakfast sofa
OL,18,Fis well disguised.
OL,20,FMany links are being presented from
OL,21,Fthe "tower" position. The sofa is not
OL,22,Fapparent in the tighter seated links.

OL,6,FThe first obvious editorial change is
OL,7,Fat 1.30pm with a shorter weather

OL,9,Fmoved back to 1.55pm.
OL,11,FThe short forecast needs to have a

OL,13,Fshould be there to give a quick

OL,6,FImmediately after the forecast, there
OL,7,Fhave been stories from BBC Verify and
OL,8,Fstudio chats. All fine but I can't
OL,9,Fhelp but feel that the regional opt
OL,10,Fshould come straight after the weather.
OL,12,FIn an ideal world, I would argue that
OL,13,Fthe nations and regions deserved a
OL,14,Flonger extension to the lunchtime
OL,15,Fbulletin.
OL,17,FI am sure the nations would have no
OL,18,Fdifficulty in producing, say, a 12-
OL,19,Fminute programme rather than a 10-
OL,20,Fminute one. But perhaps resourcing
OL,21,Fwould make this problematic in the
OL,22,FEnglish regions?
