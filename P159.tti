OL,6,GThe disgrace of Huw Edwards poses many
OL,7,Ghuge challenges for the BBC.
OL,9,FThese are issues for the corporation
OL,10,Fitself and society as a whole which
OL,11,Fwill be widely discussed elsewhere.
OL,13,FBut it also poses huge challenges
OL,14,Fconcerning the use of archive material.
OL,16,FAccording to reports over the weekend,
OL,17,Fthe BBC is "deleting" material from
OL,18,Fits archive.

OL,6,FI hope, and presume, this means that
OL,7,Fsome material will simply not be
OL,8,Froutinely available ` the actual
OL,9,Fdestruction of material is wrong in
OL,10,Fprinciple.
OL,12,FOne of the first moves concerned the
OL,13,Fremoval of an episode of Doctor Who
OL,14,Ffrom the iPlayer which included a
OL,15,Fcameo by Edwards.

OL,6,FGenerally I do not like re-editing
OL,7,Fmaterial because things which were
OL,8,Facceptable at the time it was made are
OL,9,Fno longer deemed appropriate.
OL,11,FI quite understand why the name of Guy

OL,13,Fhurt and offence but I also believe
OL,14,Fmost people are intelligent enough to
OL,15,Funderstand the context.
OL,17,FBut removing a cameo appearance by a
OL,18,Fdisgraced figure from a programme
OL,19,Fwhich could otherwise still be enjoyed
OL,20,Fis a different matter.

OL,6,FNo programme featuring Edwards should

OL,9,FBut what about clips of the moments of

OL,12,FFrom the unfolding horror of September

OL,6,FOn balance, I think we have to accept
OL,7,Fthat it will be impossible to use any
OL,8,Ffootage of BBC coverage which includes
OL,9,FEdwards' face or voice.
OL,11,FIt distorts the story by doing this.
OL,12,FFar more people, for instance, heard

OL,19,Fdistract from the story and cause

OL,6,FThe choice would therefore be between
