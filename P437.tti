OL,8,Ffrom visiting a Costa store in
OL,9,FCornwall is allowed back in.
OL,11,FDillon has become a familiar face at
OL,12,FPentewan Park in St Austell and he can
OL,13,Foften be found snoozing on a chair at
OL,14,Fthe cafe.
OL,16,FHowever, the ginger cat was banned
OL,17,Ffollowing a customer complaint,
OL,18,Fresulting in outrage from many
OL,19,Fregulars. They are now urging the
OL,20,Fbranch to allow the cat back inside.
