OL,4,Creflects on historic moment
OL,6,FIn March 1994, the first women priests
OL,7,Fin the Church of England were ordained
OL,8,Fat Bristol Cathedral.
OL,10,FThe first of them, because she came
OL,11,Ffirst alphabetically, was Angela
OL,12,FBerners-Wilson, then a chaplain at the
OL,13,FUniversity of Bristol.
OL,15,FIt was a monumental moment in the
OL,16,Fhistory of the Church and one she had
OL,17,Fcampaigned for, being a member of the
OL,18,FMovement for the Ordination of Women
OL,19,Ffor many years.

OL,6,FNow 69-years-old and retired, she's
OL,7,Freflected on a time that was
OL,8,Frevolutionary and controversial.
OL,10,FShe said: "There were 32 of us
OL,11,Fordained together and no one is
OL,12,Fordained until the final amen is said
OL,13,Fat the end of the service. I was the
OL,14,Ffirst to step forward because my name
OL,15,Fbegan with B.

OL,18,Fexciting and it's a day I will never

OL,6,FThere was no social media in those

OL,8,FAngela would have faced a huge
OL,9,Fbacklash from critics of the move. She
OL,10,Fdid, however face criticism in letter
OL,11,Fform.
OL,13,FAngela said: "I got about 300 letters
OL,14,Fand most of them were really
OL,15,Fsupportive and people were really
OL,16,Fthrilled. One or two of them were anti
OL,17,Fand one or two were really weird."
