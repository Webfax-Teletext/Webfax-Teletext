OL,6,FJodie Hayward, Animal Home Manager
OL,7,Fsaid: "These upgrades are essential to
OL,8,Fensure our cats feel safe and secure,
OL,9,Fwe want their environment to match the
OL,10,Fquality of care they receive from our
OL,11,Fanimal care team."
OL,13,FThe new doors will mean staff can make
OL,14,Fa quieter entry and exit and also
OL,15,Fprovide secure locking mechanisms.
OL,17,FThe covered lower half of the doors
OL,18,Fwill reduce anxiety for cats who feel
OL,19,Foverwhelmed by the presence of others.
