OL,6,FUnlike zebra and pelican crossings, a

OL,6,FOne student said: "We need a crossing
OL,7,Fbecause we need it to be safe for us
OL,8,Fto cross the road. The road here is
OL,9,Freally dangerous. There's a blind
OL,10,Fcorner, people come round really fast
OL,11,Fand don't notice anybody crossing."
OL,13,FThe local council agreed to pay
OL,14,F#70,000 for a standard crossing
OL,15,Foutside the school.
OL,17,FThe academy is now raising an extra

OL,19,Fthe modifications, to make it a puffin
OL,20,Fcrossing.
