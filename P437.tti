OL,7,Fhearing from campaigners in Cornwall.
OL,9,FPeople across Devon and Cornwall are
OL,10,Fcautiously welcoming news that tax
OL,11,Fbreaks for second home owners are
OL,12,Fbeing scrapped, but campaigners say
OL,13,Fit's just a sticking plaster.

OL,13,Fwill be ultimately some people that go
