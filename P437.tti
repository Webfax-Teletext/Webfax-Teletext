OL,7,FThe world's largest vertical farm has
OL,8,Fbeen set up in Gloucestershire.
OL,10,FThe Jones Food Company set up the farm
OL,11,Fcalled JFC2 in Lydney two years ago.
OL,13,FThe business grows a dozen different
OL,14,Ftypes of herbs and salad brands indoor

OL,3,CWhat are vertical farms and how can

OL,7,FVertical farming is the practice of
OL,8,Fgrowing crops in vertically stacked
OL,9,Flayers indoors rather than in
OL,10,Ftraditional horizontal fields.
OL,12,FAs the crops are grown in vertical
OL,13,Flayers, less land space is needed.
OL,15,FFor example, JFC2 has the equivalent
OL,16,Fof 70 tennis courts of growing space
OL,17,Fand the company's founder and CEO,
OL,18,FJames Lloyd-Jones, says it's an
OL,19,Fefficient process.

OL,7,FHe said: "From an environmental
OL,8,Fperspective, vertical farming allows
OL,9,Fus to grow in 17 layers, so every acre
OL,10,Fbecomes 17 times more productive.
OL,12,F"It allows us to grow entirely without

OL,14,FAnd it means we can significantly
