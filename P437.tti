OL,6,FA herd of around 40 calves have been
OL,7,Fsafely returned to their field in

OL,11,FThe 10-week-old Waygu calves from
OL,12,FBodrugan Barton Farm were found at sea
OL,13,Foff Colona Beach. It's thought they

OL,16,FIn the pitch black, with the tide
OL,17,Frising farmer Robin Kendall, Robin's
OL,18,Fpartner, vet Polly Dugmore and Robin's

OL,6,F"I would say out of 10 calves, six of
