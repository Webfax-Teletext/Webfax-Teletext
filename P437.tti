OL,6,FThe prime minister is under growing
OL,7,Fpressure to support an under-16s
OL,8,Fsocial media ban, after a letter sent

OL,10,Fsigned by more than 60 others in the
OL,11,FParty.
OL,13,FFred Thomas, the Labour MP for

OL,15,FKeir Starmer that Britain "risks being
OL,16,Fleft behind" as governments around the

OL,13,FUnder the Liberal Democrats' plan,
OL,14,Fplatforms that use "addictive

OL,17,Flegally restricted to users over the

OL,20,Fof 18+.
