OL,6,FAccording to the Environment Agency
OL,7,Fthe colour change is "simply sediment"
OL,8,Ffrom the red mudstone cliffs in the
OL,9,Farea that is being "churned up by the
OL,10,Fhigh energy waves that the recent
OL,11,Fweather has generated".
OL,13,FA spokesperson said: "The intense
OL,14,Fenergy has mobilised a lot of
OL,15,Fadditional sediment that is normally
OL,16,Fsettled out on the seabed, rather than
OL,17,Fheld in suspension."
