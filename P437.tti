OL,6,FWhat is sepsis?
OL,8,FSepsis, sometimes called septicaemia
OL,9,For blood poisoning, is and begins to
OL,10,Fdamage the body's own tissues and
OL,11,Forgans.
OL,13,FThe potentially life-threatening
OL,14,Fcondition can arise when an infection
OL,15,Fcauses the body's immune system to go
OL,16,Finto overdrive.
OL,18,FIt requires immediate hospital
OL,19,Ftreatment because, if not treated
OL,20,Fearly, it can turn into septic shock
OL,21,Fand cause your organs to fail.

OL,11,FThere are lots of possible symptoms of

OL,17,FThis means it can be hard to spot
