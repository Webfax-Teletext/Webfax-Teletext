OL,6,FA 14-mile tidal power station off the
OL,7,FSomerset coast has been hailed
OL,8,Fpotentially "life-changing" by one MP,
OL,9,Fas early plans suggest it could power

OL,13,FThe architect of the London Eye has

OL,15,Fwould stretch to around 14km from
OL,16,FMinehead to Watchet and cost around
