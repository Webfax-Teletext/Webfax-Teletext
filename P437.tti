OL,3,CMan's fight to save his home and
OL,4,C'Fiesta Land' from bulldozer
OL,6,FA man from Cheltenham says he has not
OL,7,Fslept for weeks due to plans to
OL,8,Fdemolish his home to make way for a
OL,9,Fdual carriageway and thousands of new
OL,10,Fproperties.
OL,12,FAndrew Smith has lived on the
OL,13,FTewkesbury Road in Uckington for 22
OL,14,Fyears with his home known locally as
OL,15,F'Fiesta Land' because he uses it to
OL,16,Frepair and sell Ford cars.
OL,18,FGloucestershire County Council wants
OL,19,Fto buy Mr Smith's land to make way for
OL,20,Fthe 4,000-home 'Elms Park' development
OL,21,Fnear junction 10 of the M5.

OL,6,FMr Smith says the authority has
OL,7,Foffered him #850,000 for his three-bed
OL,8,Fsemi-detached home and the land it
OL,9,Fsits on. He says this is not enough
OL,10,Fmoney to enable him to move to a
OL,11,Fsimilar property in the area.
OL,13,FHe said: "I can't find it (a similar
OL,14,Fproperty for that price). I've found
OL,15,Fsomewhere that I can do a compromise
OL,16,Fon, but they're saying 'six months -
OL,17,Fout'."
OL,19,FHe says this would mean he'd also lose
OL,20,Fmoney on his cars, as he'd have to
OL,21,Fresort to selling them at auction.
