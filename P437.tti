OL,8,Fsupport as he said his experiences
OL,9,Fwith his daughter left an "indelible

OL,12,FAt a Westminster Hall debate on

OL,14,FCamborne and Redruth - described how
OL,15,Fhis daughter had been "clutched" by
OL,16,Fanorexia, but she could only qualify
OL,17,Ffor life-saving support if she became
OL,18,Fcritically ill and was "staring death
