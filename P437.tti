OL,6,FThe big winners in the West Country at
OL,7,Fthis year's local elections were the
OL,8,FLiberal Democrats and Reform - two
OL,9,Fparties with vastly different politics
OL,10,Fwhose leaders are celebrating the same

OL,13,FIn Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Devon
OL,14,Fand Cornwall the results were similar.

OL,16,FConservative control have now been
OL,17,Ftaken over, largely by the Lib Dems,
