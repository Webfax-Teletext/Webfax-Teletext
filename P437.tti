OL,6,FSpeaking about the timing of the
OL,7,Fgeneral election, Mr Sunak said: "I
OL,8,Fcan see that the Labour Party are
OL,9,Ftrying to whip up this idea that I'm
OL,10,Fabout to call a general election. It's
OL,11,Fvery deliberate, its because they want
OL,12,Fto avoid questions about how they're
OL,13,Fgoing to fund all of their spending

OL,16,F"So, look in seven weeks time we have
OL,17,Flocal elections, including in
OL,18,FGloucester, where I was talking to
OL,19,Fthem today, we have police and crime
OL,20,Fcommissioner elections and we have
