OL,7,FGlastonbury Festival 2024 is almost
OL,8,Fupon us and with people making their
OL,9,Ffinal preparations, one question on
OL,10,Feverybody's minds is what the weather
OL,11,Fhas in store.
OL,13,FWhile the last few days has seen warm
OL,14,Fweather settle across the West
OL,15,FCountry, the question remains whether
OL,16,FWorthy Farm will remain dry during the
OL,17,Ffestival.
OL,19,FSo, if you're still debating packing
OL,20,Fyour wellies and your raincoat, this
OL,21,Fmay help.

OL,8,Fweather presenter Charlie Powell
OL,10,F"The forecast still looks good for the
OL,11,Fduration of Glastonbury with very
OL,12,Flittle rainfall and some decent
OL,13,Ftemperatures.
OL,15,F"Wednesday will be a hot one, with
OL,16,Fvery high UV and temperatures up to
OL,17,Faround 27 C. Not brilliant for
OL,18,Fdragging your kit in maybe, but great
OL,19,Ffor setting up camp in the dry.

OL,7,F"It'll get off to a fine start on

OL,10,Faround lunchtime, then introducing
OL,11,Fless humid air for the rest of the day
OL,12,Fon some brisk winds. It won't be as

OL,15,F"This then leaves the rest of the
