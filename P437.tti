OL,4,Ccapsule hiding underneath her house
OL,6,FA Swindon woman has discovered a
OL,7,Ffascinating time capsule dating back
OL,8,Fto the early 1900s hidden beneath her
OL,9,Fhome.
OL,11,FMadeline Goodwin, 26, bought the
OL,12,FVictorian terraced house in Swindon's
OL,13,FOld Town four years ago and had no
OL,14,Fidea the intriguing little box was
OL,15,Flurking there the whole time.
OL,17,FIt wasn't until last week - when she
OL,18,Fput a table for sale on Facebook
OL,19,FMarketplace - that the secret came out.

OL,6,FMs Goodwin explained: "We're currently
OL,7,Fredecorating the living room and so we
OL,8,Fhave some old furniture for sale.
OL,10,F"I posted one of the side tables on
OL,11,FMarketplace and a lady wanted to buy
OL,12,Fit. It wasn't until I gave her my
OL,13,Fpostcode so she could collect it that
OL,14,Fshe asked what street I lived on.
OL,16,F"She went on to ask for the house
OL,17,Fnumber and when I told her she said,
OL,18,F'that's my old house, I used to live
OL,19,Fthere'.

OL,6,F"It had been in her family since 1890
OL,7,Fwhen it was built. She'd sold the
OL,8,Fhouse in 2007 and there'd been maybe
OL,9,Fthree other owners since then until
OL,10,F2020, when we bought it."
OL,12,FMadeline added that the table she was
OL,13,Fselling had come from her previous
OL,14,Fhome and wasn't linked to the house at
OL,15,Fall - so it was even more amazing that
OL,16,Fthe previous owner had happened to buy
OL,17,Fit.

OL,6,F"We invited her in, because a lot of
OL,7,Fwork has been done to it since she
OL,8,Flived here and she was interested to
OL,9,Fsee how it'd changed.
OL,11,F"She came in and she was pointing out
OL,12,Fall the original features that were
OL,13,Fstill there. Then she mentioned that
OL,14,Fthere was a time capsule in the
OL,15,Fcupboard under the stairs.
OL,17,F"She said it was buried under the
OL,18,Ffloorboards, in the foundations of the
OL,19,Fproperty. Once she left, we pulled up
OL,20,Fthe floorboards to see if it was still
OL,21,Fthere," Ms Goodwin said.
