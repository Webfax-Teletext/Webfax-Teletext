OL,6,FDrinks firm Thatchers has lost a High
OL,7,FCourt trademark battle with
OL,8,Fsupermarket chain Aldi over rival

OL,11,FThe Somerset-based brewer sued the
OL,12,FGerman discounter for allegedly
OL,13,Finfringing the trademark of its
OL,14,F"cloudy lemon cider", claiming that
OL,15,FAldi's Taurus brand "copycatted" its
OL,16,Fproduct.
OL,18,FBut in a ruling on Wednesday, a judge
OL,19,Fdismissed the Thatchers case.
