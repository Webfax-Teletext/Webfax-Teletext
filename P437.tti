OL,6,FIt's those skills which have made
OL,7,FRonnie so successful, but which his
OL,8,Fnew owner, Rhonda Hopkins, says has
OL,9,Fmade his move to a quieter life more
OL,10,Ftricky.
OL,12,FShe said: "With these dogs, they've
OL,13,Fhad a lot of training to protect their
OL,14,Fhandlers, search for people, so even
OL,15,Fon walks he will still search at the
OL,16,Fmoment, because he thinks that's what
OL,17,Fhe's doing when you take him out for a

OL,6,F"(He thinks) 'I'm on a long-line and
OL,7,FI'm gonna search for something',
OL,8,Fbecause that's normally what he does
OL,9,Fwhen gets out of the van."
OL,11,FDespite his varied career - which even
OL,12,Fincluded a bit of firearms backup -
OL,13,FRonnie was forced to retire a bit
OL,14,Fearlier than planned after he was
OL,15,Finjured by cows in a field.
OL,17,FBut Rhonda believes Ronnie still has
OL,18,Fplenty of energy.

OL,6,F"I wouldn't say they're less
OL,7,Fsocialised, but they're more job
OL,8,Forientated", she said.
OL,10,F"When they retire, they've got quite a

OL,12,Fways to sort of exercise them, to keep
OL,13,Ftheir mental stimulation, their

OL,16,FPerhaps the biggest problem for Ronnie
OL,17,Fand Rhonda is the cost of vet bills.
OL,19,FThe cost of pet insurance is high but
OL,20,Ffor an ex-police dog, this can be
OL,21,Fastronomical - and can even be refused.
