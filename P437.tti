OL,4,Cafter falling through wooden bridge
OL,6,FThe team quickly ruled out using
OL,7,Fstandard lifting equipment or lifting
OL,8,Fstraps under the horse due to the
OL,9,Flocation of the bridge and how it had
OL,10,Fbecome entrapped. The rescue then
OL,11,Fproved even trickier after the first
OL,12,Ftwo plans proved unsuccessful.
OL,14,FIn a post on Facebook, Dorset and
OL,15,FWiltshire Fire and Rescue Service
OL,16,Fsaid: "Initially crews set up a
OL,17,Fplatform under the horse using hay
OL,18,Fbales and pallets whilst trying to
OL,19,Fpull the horses legs to a vertical
OL,20,Fposition, to see if the horse could
OL,21,Fpush itself up and out of the bridge."
