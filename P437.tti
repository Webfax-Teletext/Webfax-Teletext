OL,7,FHundreds of thousands of people from

OL,9,Fafter World War Two to help fill a

OL,14,F1,000 people from the West Indies in
OL,15,F1948.
OL,17,FBut in Bristol, often, they were not
OL,18,Fwarmly welcomed - having to overcome
OL,19,Fracism, housing discrimination and the
OL,20,Fcolour bar.
