OL,6,FWith the arrival of Malenky and Nanuq,
OL,7,FWildwood has now rescued eight brown

OL,12,FHe explained: "We want to help more
OL,13,Fbears like Malenky and Nanuq, but we
OL,14,Fcan only do it with the public's
OL,15,Fsupport. Every rescued bear needs
OL,16,Ffood, shelter, medical care, and
OL,17,Fenrichment. We spend around #70,000 a
OL,18,Fyear caring for each rescued bear,
OL,19,Fwhich is why fundraising is essential
OL,20,Fto everything we do.
