OL,6,FThe main concern was that the meters
OL,7,Fwould have a negative effect on the
OL,8,Fhigh streets which are already
OL,9,Fstruggling.
OL,11,FAlthough the first hour's parking
OL,12,Fwould be free, drivers would still

OL,15,FA survey conducted by Tavistock BID

OL,17,Fvisit the town less if meters were
