OL,6,FA fox that was trapped in a Wiltshire
OL,7,Ffarm's slurry lagoon has been rescued
OL,8,Fby the RSPCA.
OL,10,FHe had walked out onto the 25 metre
OL,11,F(82 foot) expanse of rain-filled
OL,12,Fplastic sheeting, covering the lagoon
OL,13,Fin Warminster.
OL,15,FBut because the sides were steep and
OL,16,Fvery slippery, he was unable to get
OL,17,Fback out.
OL,19,FThe concerned farmer was unable to
OL,20,Fcoax the fox to safety, so he
OL,21,Fcontacted the for help.

OL,6,FRSPCA animal rescue officer, Gemma
OL,7,FGumbleton, said: "This poor fox had
OL,8,Fbeen trapped in the pooled water on
OL,9,Fthe plastic sheeting for some time and
OL,10,Fwas in real danger.
OL,12,F"As he moved around to try to get away
OL,13,Ffrom the water, he would weigh down
OL,14,Fthat section of sheeting and the water
OL,15,Fwould pool around him again.
OL,17,F"He needed to be rescued urgently as
OL,18,Fthe bitter cold and stress could have
OL,19,Fkilled him."

OL,12,F"Because of these challenges, I knew

OL,6,FThe Fire and Rescue teams used the

OL,11,F"Finally, after more than three hours,
OL,12,Fthe poor fox was so tired, cold and

OL,14,Fimmobile," Gemma said.
OL,16,F"At that point, one of the Fire and
