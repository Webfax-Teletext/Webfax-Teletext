OL,6,FGeorge Mitchell, from Rolls Royce,

OL,8,F"remarkable."
OL,10,FRemains of the settlement included
OL,11,Fseveral holes where posts were fitted
OL,12,Fto support "simple, small buildings".
OL,14,FArcheologists said several pits, most

OL,16,Ffound within the settlement.
OL,18,FPrehistoric artefacts including small
