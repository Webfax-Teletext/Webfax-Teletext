OL,6,FIn the original study, Dr David
OL,7,FWhiteside, Dr Sofia Chambi-Trowell and
OL,8,FProfessor Mike Benton, named the
OL,9,Flittle critter Cryptovaranoides
OL,10,Fmicrolanius, meaning 'hidden lizard,
OL,11,Fsmall butcher' because of its
OL,12,Fidentification as a lizard and its
OL,13,Fsharp teeth, probably used for cutting
OL,14,Fup prey animals for food.
OL,16,FThe School of Earth Sciences team
OL,17,Fidentified many anatomical features of
OL,18,Fthe skull and skeleton that allowed
OL,19,Fthem to place it well within Squamata,
OL,20,Fand even close to the Anguimorpha.

OL,11,Feverything we could."
OL,13,FProfessor Benton said: "We were
OL,14,Ftherefore surprised, perhaps even
OL,15,Fshocked, that in 2023 another team of
OL,16,Facademics suggested that
OL,17,FCryptovaranoides was not a lizard or
OL,18,Feven a lizard relative, but in fact an
OL,19,Farchosauromorph, more closely related
OL,20,Fto crocodilians and dinosaurs."
