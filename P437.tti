OL,7,F"Cliff falls are a perfect example of
OL,8,Fthis. Wave action at the base of the

OL,12,FAccording to Dr. Poate, the threat
OL,13,Fcomes not only from increased wave
OL,14,Faction but also from varying weather
OL,15,Fconditions, as cliffs can weaken and
OL,16,Fcollapse due to heavy rain or
OL,17,Fprolonged dry spells.
OL,19,F"A combination of these factors will
OL,20,Fprobably accelerate the cliff's
OL,21,Fretreat," he said.
