OL,14,FHe confirmed Motion Events had an

OL,16,Fonly "if it were not used as a going

OL,6,FMr Deeks said the firm created a

OL,8,Fvalue for the landlord and develop the
OL,9,Fsite to add creative spaces above the
OL,10,Fmain venue. He said these plans were

OL,12,Fwhich recognises Motion as an

OL,14,Feconomic asset for the city.
OL,16,FHowever he said that the "pressures
