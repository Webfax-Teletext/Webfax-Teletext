OL,6,FJohn Murphy, from Calne, is now
OL,7,Fcampaigning for an acknowledgement
OL,8,Fthat his sister was very much "a
OL,9,Fperson" who was "loved and wanted

OL,12,FHis parents were not given the chance
OL,13,Fto spend time with his sister's body
OL,14,Fafter her birth.
OL,16,FHe explained: "The nurse came out of
OL,17,Fthe room, she was carrying a bundle
OL,18,Fwrapped in a blanket, and she said,
OL,19,F'I'm awfully sorry, Mr Murphy, but

OL,21,Fand she walked away, and that was it."
