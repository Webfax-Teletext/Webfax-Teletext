OL,6,F"I saw a tiny figure in the surf, and
OL,7,Frealised it was a baby seal," he said.
OL,8,F"It was trying to pull itself on the
OL,9,Fbeach, and was heading towards a crowd
OL,10,Fof tourists."
OL,12,F"It looked exhausted and was
OL,13,Fcoughing," he added.
OL,15,FOnce they arrived, rescuers carried
OL,16,Fout a first aid check on the pup,
OL,17,Fwhich they believe to be around five
OL,18,Fmonths old.

OL,6,F"People were brilliant at keeping
OL,7,Fthemselves, dogs and children away
OL,8,Ffrom the seal," she said. "That is a
OL,9,Fgift for us as it means it was still
OL,10,Fin the same place and hadn't been
OL,11,Fchased back into the sea, which is the
OL,12,Fworst-case scenario."
OL,14,FShe added: "We did his breathing rate
OL,15,Fand could see it was slightly elevated
OL,16,Fso we carried out a full assessment to
OL,17,Fmake sure there was nothing else wrong
OL,18,Fwith him.
OL,20,F"His temperature was slightly high but
OL,21,Fluckily we couldn't find any wounds."

OL,6,FMs Davey said they will now take the

OL,10,F"We will also mark him, so if he is

OL,15,F"This means if he has lost weight, we
