OL,6,FAsked what had happened that

OL,10,Fafter she had called her husband to
OL,11,Fhelp her with the horses.
OL,13,FShe said: "He said that I was going to
OL,14,Fdie. It just seemed like a bad dream,
OL,15,FI was so afraid, I thought he really
OL,16,Fis going to kill me. He had several

OL,6,FWhen asked if she had stabbed her

OL,10,FThe jury had been read a catalogue of

OL,12,Fbetween Mr and Mrs Rawle.
OL,14,FThroughout, there were endearments
OL,15,Fbetween the two of them, but as the

OL,17,FMrs Rawle accusing her husband of
OL,18,Fbeing weak, feeble, a pathetic excuse
OL,19,Fof a man.
