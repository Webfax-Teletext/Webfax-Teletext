OL,6,FAn historic pub near Bath that dates
OL,7,Fback almost 500 years has finally
OL,8,Freopened after a mammoth community
OL,9,Feffort.
OL,11,FWork to open the Hop Pole Inn at
OL,12,FLimpley Stoke has taken almost three
OL,13,Fyears. Hundreds of people donated more
OL,14,Fthan a million pounds and volunteered
OL,15,Fcountless hours to painstakingly
OL,16,Frestore it to its former glory.

OL,13,Fsaid: "It is one of the best days of

OL,6,FThe Hop Pole Inn has been serving

OL,8,F2018 and was due to be sold to
OL,9,Fdevelopers so it could be turned into
OL,10,Fhousing.
OL,12,FBut it was bought by the community
OL,13,Finstead in 2022, in the first of what
OL,14,Fhas become a series of marathon
OL,15,Ffundraising events.
OL,17,FWhen members of the Save The Hop Pole
OL,18,Fcampaign group first entered their new
OL,19,Fpurchase, they found rotten beams, a
OL,20,Fhole in the roof, broken electrics and
OL,21,Flots of damp.
