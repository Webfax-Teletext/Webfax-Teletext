OL,6,FOne of the plane pilots stated in a
OL,7,Fpersonal statement read to the court
OL,8,Fthat the laser attack happened during
OL,9,Fa "critical stage" of the flight.
OL,11,FThe pilot said: "You can see how
OL,12,Fdistractions and disturbances from
OL,13,Flaser attacks are dangerous whilst the
OL,14,Fpilots are required to be totally
OL,15,Ffocused.
OL,17,F"Laser attacks on aircraft also have
OL,18,Fthe ability to temporarily 'flash
OL,19,Fblind' - rendering one or both pilots
OL,20,Fblind whilst they are flying is
OL,21,Fobviously extremely dangerous."
