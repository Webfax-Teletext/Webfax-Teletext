OL,7,FThe manager of a Keynsham charity shop
OL,8,Fhas likened the mounds of donations
OL,9,Fleft outside the premises to "fly-
OL,10,Ftipping", saying her staff "physically
OL,11,Fcan't get through" the piles.
OL,13,FCaitlin Brennan, who runs Golden
OL,14,FOldies, recalled finding unwashed
OL,15,Funderwear and soiled bedsheets among
OL,16,Fthe items "donated".
OL,18,FThe shop receives donations daily but
OL,19,FMs Brennan says only half of them can
OL,20,Fbe re-sold to the general public.

OL,7,FStaff have dealt with used cosmetics,

OL,12,FCaitlin told ITV West Country that the

OL,14,F"excessive", listing some of the more

OL,7,FShe explained: "I think a lot of it is
OL,8,Flaziness. I think people don't want to
OL,9,Ftake accountability for their own
OL,10,Fwaste and realise what they should be
OL,11,Fdoing with it.
OL,13,F"And instead, just giving it to us
OL,14,Ffeels like they've done a good thing,
OL,15,Fthey've donated to charity, but
OL,16,Funfortunately, it's not helpful to us."
OL,18,FCaitlin says the issue is happening
OL,19,F"across the country", and that staff
OL,20,Fhave experienced aggression when
OL,21,Fturning donations away.
