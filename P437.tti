OL,4,CSwindon is a 'must win' for Labour
OL,6,FSwindon has been a bellwether town for
OL,7,Fmore than four decades, with voters
OL,8,Fgoing in the same direction as the
OL,9,Fcountry at every election since 1983.
OL,11,FWhen the town was split into two
OL,12,Fconstituencies in 1997, that trend
OL,13,Fcontinued. Swindon South - as it's now
OL,14,Fnamed - was Labour until the
OL,15,FConservatives came to power in 2010.
OL,17,FIt has been held by the Tories ever
OL,18,Fsince, mirroring the national
OL,19,Fpolitical landscape, and is at the
OL,20,Fvery top of Labour's list of target
OL,21,Fseats in the South West.
