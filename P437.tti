OL,6,FA Devon village is to lose one of its
OL,7,Ftwo pubs, despite a campaign by
OL,8,Fvillagers to save it.
OL,10,FLocals claimed the Red Lion at Tedburn
OL,11,FSt Mary was a "force for good" in the
OL,12,Fcommunity, and could re-open as a pub
OL,13,Fafter being closed for two years.
OL,15,FBut the owner told Teignbridge
OL,16,FCouncil's planning committee he could
OL,17,Fnot keep it going any longer and it
OL,18,Fneeded to be converted into houses.

OL,6,FVillagers raised money towards buying

OL,9,Fand supporters said buyers were
OL,10,Finterested in taking it on as a pub
OL,11,Fagain.
OL,13,FOwner Terry Tume told the meeting:
OL,14,F"The village doesn't want to lose the

OL,19,FHe added the planned development of

OL,21,Ffor homes.

OL,6,FObjector Martin Rich said the
OL,7,Fvillage's other pub, the nearby King's
OL,8,FArms, could not deliver the 'community
OL,9,Ffocus' of the Red Lion. "It is viable
OL,10,Fas a pub," he said. "Its loss would
OL,11,Fsignificantly diminish our community."
OL,13,FCouncillors had put off making a

OL,15,Fbeen on a site visit to see it in more
