OL,6,FA Bengal cat had to have its leg
OL,7,Famputated after getting caught in what
OL,8,Fits owner claims was an illegal gin
OL,9,Ftrap.
OL,11,FCliff Spittle said the cat, named
OL,12,FWilson, had been stuck with the trap
OL,13,Fattached to its leg for several days
OL,14,Fbefore being found.
OL,16,FMr Spittle, from Yelland, said: "The
OL,17,Fcat had this on for three days before
OL,18,Fwe found her. The leg was in a right
OL,19,Fmess."

OL,9,Fthe vet bills were #3,000 and they

OL,10,Fillegal to cause an animal to suffer

OL,13,Ftraps many times.
OL,15,F"Gin traps are mechanical devices
OL,16,Fdesigned to catch an animal by its
OL,17,Fleg, using spring-operated jaws with
OL,18,Fteeth or serrated edges.
