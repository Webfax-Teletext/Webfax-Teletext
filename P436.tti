OL,8,Farrest at a property on Gorwell Road.
OL,10,FOfficers and paramedics found Ms Adams
OL,11,Funresponsive with injuries to her face

OL,14,FThe court heard Ms Adams and Loder had
OL,15,Ftaken a mixture of crack cocaine,
OL,16,Famphetamines and alcohol over a period
OL,17,Fof three days.
OL,19,FWhen first interviewed, Loder said

OL,6,FIn a later statement, Loder said she

OL,11,FLoder said: "There was no one closer

OL,6,FA forensic post-mortem examination
OL,7,Fconcluded that although it was likely
OL,8,Fthe assault had played a role in Ms
OL,9,FAdams' death, it was not possible to
OL,10,Fexclude the possibility that death
OL,11,Fwould have occurred due to the
OL,12,Fcombined effects of cocaine use and an
OL,13,Funderlying medical condition in the
OL,14,Fabsence of an assault.
OL,16,FThis saw Loder charged with grievous
