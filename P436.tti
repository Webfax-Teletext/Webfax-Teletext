OL,6,FNina, who is a wheelchair user, said:
OL,7,F"My carers are my lifeline. I have
OL,8,Fthem four times a day and they
OL,9,Fliterally do everything. They shower
OL,10,Fme in the morning, they get me out of
OL,11,Fbed, they prepare my food, they do my
OL,12,Fexercises.
OL,14,F"If I was in hospital without them it
OL,15,Fwould be horrific.

OL,13,FIn Swindon, The Great Western Hospital

OL,15,FBut Nina realised not all hospitals
OL,16,Fare the same. After hearing horror

OL,18,Fshe decided to set up an online
OL,19,Fpetition.
