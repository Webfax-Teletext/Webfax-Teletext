OL,7,FA pharmacist in Bristol says the
OL,8,Findustry is in crisis and says the
OL,9,Fsituation is the most challenging he's
OL,10,Ffaced in his thirty-year career.
OL,12,F. In the Fishponds area alone, four
OL,13,Fpharmacies have closed, two in the
OL,14,Flast month, leaving remaining
OL,15,Fcommunity pharmacies overwhelmed with
OL,16,Fpatients.
OL,18,FThere is also a national drug shortage
OL,19,Fof around 100 medicines, which means
OL,20,Ffinding drugs to dispense is an
OL,21,Fincreasing challenge.
