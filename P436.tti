OL,6,FThis round was held inside a hanger at
OL,7,FRNAS Culdrose on Wednesday 13 March -
OL,8,Fschool teams had to build their robot,
OL,9,Fdesign it and then learn how to code

OL,12,FThe event takes place over two days,
OL,13,Fwith 60 schools taking part and

OL,6,FDespite the children competing to
OL,7,Fbuild the best robot, the camaraderie
OL,8,Fand hard work of the children is
OL,9,Fclear.JOne of the children said:
OL,10,F"First it was nerve-wracking because
OL,11,Fwe didn't know what to expect and how
OL,12,Fto actually do it. But once you've
OL,13,Fdone your practice runs you understand
OL,14,Fit more."
OL,16,FAnother added: "It's quite hard. It's
OL,17,Fjust trying to get it (the robot) to
OL,18,Fgo to the right place and do the right
OL,19,Fthing."

OL,6,F"They have to build the robot, design

OL,8,Fsaid Melanie Wells, the assistant head
OL,9,Fat Trevithick Learning Academy.
OL,11,F"Then they have to solve their

OL,16,FAcknowledging that her own coding

OL,6,FJudging the competition, Cmdr Andy
OL,7,FBetts, head engineer of RNAS Culdrose,
OL,8,Fsaid: "The kids have been fantastic. I
OL,9,Fdid some judging earlier and the way
OL,10,Fthey've taught through you, how they
OL,11,Fresearch their own problems, how
OL,12,Fthey're diving into YouTube videos and
OL,13,Ffinding ways to code their robots.
OL,14,FFantastic."
OL,16,FHe added: "It just shows that, you
OL,17,Fknow, you don't need to go through
OL,18,Fcourses and degrees to be able to just
OL,19,Fhave a go at this stuff - it's really
OL,20,Fgood."

OL,6,FOn top of the competition, there were
OL,7,Fplenty of science experiments and
OL,8,Fgadgets to show the children.
OL,9,FOrganisers hoped to get boys and
OL,10,Fespecially girls to see what parts of
OL,11,Fscience and engineering they enjoy.
OL,12,FCaitlyn Gould, founder of Tec Girls at
OL,13,Fthe event, said: "Our research has
OL,14,Fshown that across Cornwall, only 3% of
OL,15,Fgirls are choosing a computing science
OL,16,FGCSE and we know that there's big
OL,17,Fproblems with take up with girls"J"So
OL,18,Fwhat we want to try to do is create a
