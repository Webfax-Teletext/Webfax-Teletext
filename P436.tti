OL,6,FGardener Hannah Milburn said: "We
OL,7,Fstarted doing the outline first and
OL,8,Fthen began filling it in. We do it by
OL,9,Fshaded colour, so it's very precise
OL,10,Fand takes quite a lot of time.
OL,12,F"At the end of the weekend, we'll take
OL,13,Fa few wheelbarrows away each day,
OL,14,Funtil we're left with a little core."
OL,16,FChildren were excited to see the
OL,17,Fdesign, with one saying: "I think it's
OL,18,Freally great how they've done the
OL,19,Fapples blending in with the colours."
