OL,7,FA man from Somerset has opened up
OL,8,Fabout being one of the pilots on the
OL,9,Ffirst non-stop balloon flight around
OL,10,Fthe world.
OL,12,FIn 1999 Brian Jones from Taunton took
OL,13,Foff from Switzerland as co-pilot on
OL,14,Fthe incredible mission, landing in
OL,15,FEgypt 19 days and 28,000 miles later.
OL,17,FThe balloon was made in Bristol and
OL,18,Fbecause of its size, it had never even
OL,19,Fbeen tested before the record-breaking
OL,20,Fflight.

OL,11,FHe said: "It was due to take off just
OL,12,Fafter sunrise. I was really nervous, a
OL,13,Flittle bit scared but elated too as
OL,14,Fthis was the ultimate flight one could
OL,15,Fdo in a hot air balloon and I was part
OL,16,Fof it.
