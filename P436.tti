OL,6,F"Mid-morning, suddenly the pavement
OL,7,Frose and the cycle path rose and
OL,8,Ffaeces came out onto the street and it
OL,9,Fwas just gushing because it was being
OL,10,Fpumped, because of the way the sewers
OL,11,Fhave to pump up towards College Hill.
OL,13,F"Fortunately, the whole building is
