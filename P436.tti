OL,6,FA dog called Bobby is looking for a

OL,9,Fsanctuary.
OL,11,FThe greyhound was rescued by Woodside
OL,12,FAnimal Welfare Sanctuary near Plympton
OL,13,Fthree years ago.
OL,15,FStaff at the centre say Bobby has
OL,16,Fwatched hundreds of dogs arrive and
OL,17,Fthen leave with their forever
OL,18,Ffamilies, but despite his 'sweet,
OL,19,Faffectionate nature,' 'bouncy' Bobby
OL,20,Fis repeatedly overlooked.

OL,6,FSanctuary manager Lisa Darcy said:
OL,7,F"Bobby has never had a home so doesn't
OL,8,Frealise what he's missing out on, but
OL,9,Fwe do.
OL,11,F"We just can't put our finger on why
OL,12,Fhe's not found his forever home. He's
OL,13,Ffriendly, gentle and loves walks but
OL,14,Fhe's also happy spending most of the
OL,15,Ftime on the sofa with his legs in the
OL,16,Fair.
OL,18,F"He's happy around other dogs and is
OL,19,Fsociable so would make a great
OL,20,Fcompanion to visit places with.

OL,6,F"Bobby is a lovely dog," Lisa said.
OL,7,F"He can be overprotective of toys and
OL,8,Fnot want to share them, but he has had
OL,9,Ftraining which we can teach his new

OL,13,F"Because of this we think it's best
