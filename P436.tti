OL,6,FTwenty years ago in a laboratory in

OL,8,Fhad for a long time been an invisible

OL,11,FProfessor Richard Thompson OBE and his

OL,13,Fthe first in the world to publish a
OL,14,Fscientific paper on microplastics in
OL,15,F2004.
OL,17,FTheir work showed that tiny pieces and
OL,18,Fparticles of plastic - measuring 5mm
OL,19,For less - have been accumulating in
OL,20,Fthe world's oceans since the 1960s.

OL,6,FImproved product design could
OL,7,Fdramatically reduce the release of
OL,8,Fmicroplastics fibres from textiles and
OL,9,Fit is likely that this approach could
OL,10,Falso be used to reduce the rate at
OL,11,Fwhich particles are released from
OL,12,Fvehicle tyres.
OL,14,FSubstantial quantities of microplastic
OL,15,Fpellets, powders and flakes - out of
OL,16,Fwhich most larger items are made - are
OL,17,Fspilled into the environment every

OL,19,Fhazardous could help promote better
OL,20,Findustrial practice.
