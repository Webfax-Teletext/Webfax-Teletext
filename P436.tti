OL,6,FA Liberal Democrat MP who was denied
OL,7,Fentry into Hong Kong by Chinese
OL,8,Fauthorities has warned Britain risks
OL,9,Fgetting too close to China.
OL,11,FWera Hobhouse, MP for Bath, said she
OL,12,Fwas concerned about the potential
OL,13,Fexistence of a "hidden blacklist,"
OL,14,Fwhich could secretly bar MPs from
OL,15,Fentering the former British territory
OL,16,Fafter she was halted while trying to
OL,17,Fvisit family.
