OL,6,FAdrienne's husband and daughter say
OL,7,Fthey are both incredibly proud after
OL,8,Freading the letter.
OL,10,FPaul Fry, Adrienne's husband, said:
OL,11,F"It's very emotional because suddenly
OL,12,Fyou have a connection between the
OL,13,Fperson you've lost and somebody who is
OL,14,Fbenefiting from that loss, which is
OL,15,Fquite a unique experience.
OL,17,F"And it also gives the family solace
OL,18,Fto know that there is something
OL,19,Fpositive coming out of that awful
OL,20,Fexperience of death, which we all will
OL,21,Fgo through."

OL,6,FAdrienne spent her whole life caring
OL,7,Ffor others. She was a headteacher at

OL,9,Fand Cheltenham before she retired.
OL,11,FEven then, she went on to build a

OL,15,FBut as she got older she developed a
OL,16,Fnumber of health conditions before she
OL,17,Fpassed away.
OL,19,FHer family say the act of organ
OL,20,Fdonation has been a very positive
