OL,6,FPolice dogs in the UK are used for a
OL,7,Fvariety of purposes, including
OL,8,Ftracking suspects, searching for
OL,9,Fmissing people, and recovering
OL,10,Fevidence. They are trained in
OL,11,Fdifferent roles and disciplines, and
OL,12,Fcome in a variety of breeds.

OL,15,FLoki, Nova and Sully are siblings that
