OL,6,FThe Windrush is seen as a symbol of
OL,7,FCaribbean migration between 1948 and
OL,8,F1971.

OL,11,Fdescendants of Windrush migrants had
OL,12,Fbeen threatened with deportation and
OL,13,Fstripped of their benefits. The UK
OL,14,Fgovernment was forced to apologise and
OL,15,Fpay compensation.
