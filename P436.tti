OL,7,FGlastonbury Festival 2024 is almost
OL,8,Fupon us and with people making their
OL,9,Ffinal preparations, one question on
OL,10,Feverybody's minds is what the weather
OL,11,Fhas in store.
OL,13,FWhile the last few days has seen warm
OL,14,Fweather settle across the West
OL,15,FCountry, the question remains whether
OL,16,FWorthy Farm will remain dry during the
OL,17,Ffestival.
OL,19,FSo, if you're still debating packing
OL,20,Fyour wellies and your raincoat, this
OL,21,Fmay help.
