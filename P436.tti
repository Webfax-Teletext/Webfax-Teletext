OL,12,FThe oak tree stood as a historic

OL,17,FHe said: "I was just looking up and I

OL,6,F"I couldn't believe it because this
OL,7,Ftree has been part of the village for
OL,8,Flonger than I've been here so it's
OL,9,Fbeen an old friend for a long time.
OL,11,F"I've always known that I guess that

OL,20,Fhelp decide how the tree's legacy can
