OL,6,FJudge Picton added that Bowers'
OL,7,Fconfession amounted to a "boast" of
OL,8,Fwhat he did and showed no remorse. He
OL,9,Fsaid Bowers had no reason to attack Mr
OL,10,FBryan or for the "sustained and savage
OL,11,Ffashion" in which he did, adding the
OL,12,Flevel of violence was "grotesque".
OL,14,FThe judge described Mr Bryan as a
OL,15,F"gentle soul" loved by family and

OL,18,FMr Bryan's mother, Anne, said: "He was
