OL,8,FCountry with her music performed on a

OL,11,FChloe Marie Aston, 20, from Ilfracombe
OL,12,Fpicked up the instrument for the first
OL,13,Ftime five years ago and has been
OL,14,Fserenading shoppers ever since.
OL,16,FNow, as festival season draws to a
OL,17,Fclose, she sat down with ITV News West
OL,18,FCountry to reflect on her career so
OL,19,Ffar and plans for the future.

OL,6,FChloe said: "It's such a nice job to
OL,7,Fhave, to go out and play music and
OL,8,Fmake people happy.
OL,10,F"But it's weird to be kind of a known
OL,11,Ffigure in the South West now."
OL,13,FUntil this summer, Chloe helped out in
OL,14,Fher family's petrol station, which
OL,15,Fthey'd owned for roughly 40 years.
OL,17,FWhen her grandad sold it in July, she
OL,18,Fmade the leap to busking full-time and
OL,19,Fplans to continue through the winter.

OL,6,F"I will probably do shorter days with
OL,7,Flots of breaks for hot chocolate, but
OL,8,FI have some fingerless gloves and last
OL,9,Fyear I invested in an electric hand
OL,10,Fwarmer, so I'm well prepared," Chloe
OL,11,Fsaid.
OL,13,FAlthough she's now fully fitted-out
OL,14,Fwith everything she needs, Chloe's
OL,15,Fpiano bike hasn't always been part of
OL,16,Fher act.
OL,18,F"I started busking when I was 14 and
OL,19,Fback then I played the guitar. But I
OL,20,Fwasn't very good at it and I used to
OL,21,Fcomplain about it.

OL,6,F"My dad would sit there, watching me
OL,7,Fplay, and then one day he came up with
OL,8,Fthe idea of putting a piano on a bike.
OL,10,F"I didn't know how to play the piano
OL,11,Fat all at the time, so he told me his
OL,12,Fidea and he said, 'If I build this
OL,13,Fpiano bike, will you learn to play the
OL,14,Fpiano?' and so I did.
OL,16,F"A lot of people think I'm selling ice

OL,18,Fsee the keys and realise 'oh it's a
OL,19,Fpiano'
