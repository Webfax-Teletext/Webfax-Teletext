OL,7,Fcaught it quite well and it went

OL,9,Fdipped, and landed on what looked like
OL,10,Fmy dad's head.
OL,12,F"From where I was, 40-50 metres away,
OL,13,Fit looked really serious. He went
OL,14,Fstraight down, and it was all a little
OL,15,Fbit frightening for a few seconds.
OL,17,F"I threw all my stuff on the floor and
OL,18,Fraced over to see if he was okay.
OL,19,FLuckily a couple of our experiences

OL,21,Fmade sure he was okay."

OL,14,Fand attended a match on the Sunday too.
OL,16,FDespite the commotion, they did count
