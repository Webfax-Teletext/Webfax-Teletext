OL,6,FA pub in Exeter has brought in three
OL,7,Fbirds of prey to help deter its
OL,8,Fseagulls in its beer garden.
OL,10,FIt's hoped the new recruits will stop
OL,11,Fthe gulls, which have become a
OL,12,Ffrequent problem ovet the years, from
OL,13,Fambushing customers.
OL,15,FThe Imperial has become well known for
OL,16,Fits inventive ways of keeping seagulls
OL,17,Fout of its beer garden. In 2022, the
OL,18,Fpub gained national attention for
OL,19,Finstalling shrieking alarms in a bid
OL,20,Fto keep them away.

OL,6,F"I found that using gull alarm calls
OL,7,Fis something people have used
OL,8,Feffectively - alarm calls are the
OL,9,Fsound gulls make when they see a
OL,10,Fpredator and they function to warn
OL,11,Fothers.J"The problem with using
OL,12,Fanything like this to deter animals is
OL,13,Fthat animals habituate - after a while
OL,14,Fthey will get used to the sounds,
OL,15,Fespecially as they will suss out there
OL,16,Fis no danger present. This is why a
OL,17,Fcombination of deterrents is best,
