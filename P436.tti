OL,16,F"Richard Trevithick in Cornwall
OL,17,Fespecially, was the first person to
OL,18,Fintroduce a powered vehicle on the
OL,19,Froad. So for Cornwall and for the

OL,6,FExhibitor Rosemary Wheadon thinks the
OL,7,Finvention of steam power is still the
OL,8,Fbest ever engineering feat.
OL,10,FShe said: "Look at the workmanship in
OL,11,Fit, the men and women who did it in
OL,12,Fthose days, who designed it, made it,
OL,13,Fthey knock us into a cocked hat really.
OL,15,F"It's amazing how they actually
OL,16,Fmanaged to get these things designed
OL,17,Fand built when they did, we think
OL,18,Fwe're clever now, but they were clever
OL,19,Fback then".

OL,6,FJago is only nine, but he's already an
OL,7,Fenthusiast, with his own miniature
OL,8,Fengine called Puffer.
OL,10,FWhen asked why he likes Puffer so
OL,11,Fmuch, Jago said: "One it's my
OL,12,Ffavourite colour - red. And it just
OL,13,Ftakes my mind off stuff. When I have a
OL,14,Fproblem I'll think of Puffer.
OL,16,F"It's really calming hearing the sound

OL,18,Fbut in a good way."
