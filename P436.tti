OL,6,FVictory's owner, David Carne,
OL,7,Fdescribed the moment he realised the
OL,8,Fconditions had got the better of him.
OL,10,FHe said: "I thought we'd go over to
OL,11,Fthe most sheltered side of the harbour
OL,12,Funderneath Trefusis.
OL,14,F"I was being very cautious but the
OL,15,Fwind was so strong, as the boat went
OL,16,Fover another gust hit us and being an
OL,17,Fopen boat, we sank.
OL,19,F"It was on the bottom within 15
OL,20,Fseconds, fortuitously we sank in a
OL,21,Fnice soft, shallow bottomed place."
