OL,6,FAs in other parts of the West Country,

OL,13,FPatroller John Alcock said: "Here we

OL,15,Fdoorstep and yet the toads are under
OL,16,Fthreat from cars and cyclists.
OL,18,F"We can save them and help them keep

OL,20,Fby popping them in our buckets and
OL,21,Fwalking them over the busy road.
