OL,12,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,13,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,14,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,15,Fplants of the same species. Many

OL,5,FThe immune system normally defends the

OL,10,FSome peoples immune system mistakenly

OL,5,FSome grasses release their pollen in
