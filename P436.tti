OL,9,FVoters had their say in Thursday's

OL,7,Ffollowing a testy and fractious
OL,8,Fcampaign, the "yes" and "no" teams
OL,9,Fshook hands in the Life Centre's
OL,10,Fbrightly lit sports hall, a spot which
OL,11,Fhas become synonymous with the never-

OL,14,FCharlotte Holloway, on the "no" side -
OL,15,Fbranded as "Plymouth Knows Better" -
OL,16,Finsisted the referendum was an
OL,17,Fexpensive waste of time, that there
OL,18,Fwas never going to be a mayor and now
OL,19,Fthere never will be.

OL,12,FIn the lead-up to polling day,
