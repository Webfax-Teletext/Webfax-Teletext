OL,6,FAn artist from Bristol who has drawn
OL,7,Fmore than 30 of the city's pubs is
OL,8,Fplanning to create a book featuring
OL,9,Fhis work.
OL,11,FFrank Morris, 30, was first inspired
OL,12,Fto draw what he calls "one of the best
OL,13,Fthings about this country" after being
OL,14,Fstruck by the "beautiful" architecture
OL,15,Fof his local pub in Kentish Town,
OL,16,Fnorth-west London.
OL,18,FMorris drew around 19 pubs in the
OL,19,Fcapital, before moving to the Easton
OL,20,Farea of Bristol roughly two years ago.
