OL,9,Fsaid: "This wonderful duo were
OL,10,Fabandoned together in a lay-by. No
OL,11,Fowner has been traced, so they are now
OL,12,Fvery keen to find a new home of their
OL,13,Fown.
OL,15,F"This pair really do adore each other.
OL,16,FWe have tried to separate them,
OL,17,Fwondering if maybe Beans gets on
OL,18,FBernadette's nerves, but they just
OL,19,Fwant to be together in everything they
OL,20,Fdo. We are unsure if Bernadette is
OL,21,FBean's Mum, but feel it's quite likely.
