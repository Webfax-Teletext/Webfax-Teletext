OL,3,CSeal pup undergoes major surgery for
OL,4,Cbroken flipper
OL,6,FIn a delicate two-hour operation,
OL,7,FPurple was placed under anaesthetic,
OL,8,Fwhich carries a higher risk of
OL,9,Fcomplications than with other animals.
OL,11,FVet and clinical director Matthew
OL,12,FBerriman said: "The rear flipper of a
OL,13,Fseal contains five bony digits, which
OL,14,Fare very much like human fingers.
OL,16,F"There were obvious bite marks on
OL,17,FPurple's flipper and it looks like
OL,18,Fanother seal had clamped down quite
OL,19,Fhard with their teeth, fracturing one
OL,20,Fof the bones. It was quite a bad break
OL,21,Fand the wound had become infected.
