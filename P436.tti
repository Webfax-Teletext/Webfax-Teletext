OL,6,FWhat started as just the work of two
OL,7,Fpeople - El and her husband Ash
OL,8,FSamuels - has now grown into a huge
OL,9,Fmovement in the city made up of 43
OL,10,Fdifferent groups of litter-pickers.
OL,12,FClean Our Patch removes between 1,500
OL,13,Fand 2,000 bags of rubbish from
OL,14,FPlymouth every month.
OL,16,FIt is then burned at a 'waste to

OL,6,F"You find some really cool old litter,
OL,7,Fwhich is always quite good fun," El

OL,10,F"Finding stuff from when I was a kid
OL,11,Fin the 90s - we found mini Smarties
OL,12,Fthe other day which was brilliant and
OL,13,FI felt like a right child again."
OL,15,FBut despite the nostalgia, the vast

OL,17,Fgroup is something El describes as
OL,18,F"terrifying".
