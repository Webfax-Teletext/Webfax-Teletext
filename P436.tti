OL,8,F"disabled" and "normal" in an email.
OL,10,FThe club is introducing e-tickets for
OL,11,Fseason ticket holders and is offering
OL,12,Fa physical card to supporters who do
OL,13,Fnot want to have their ticket on their

OL,17,Fthe club and a representative of its
OL,18,Fsupporters' club, Bristol Rovers said
OL,19,Fthat the #15 fee for those who want a

OL,10,F"As for normal fans and older fans,
