OL,8,Fin the weeks leading up to the
OL,9,F"sustained, brutal and frenzied
OL,10,Fattack" on Mr Mayo.
OL,12,FSentencing Moore on Friday 10 January,
OL,13,FJudge Peter Blair KC, said: "You are
OL,14,Fgoing to lose your liberty for an
OL,15,Findefinite period."
OL,17,FHe added: "You are not facing sentence
OL,18,Ffor the murder of James Mayo because
OL,19,Fyour responsibility for killing him
OL,20,Fwas diminished by reason of severe
OL,21,Fpsychotic mental illness.
