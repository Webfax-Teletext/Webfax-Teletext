OL,7,Ffor 42 years, has closed after its

OL,14,Fowners retiring, it was hoped the
OL,15,Fbusiness could continue under a new
OL,16,Fowner.
OL,18,FHowever, despite coming close to
OL,19,Fselling, a prospective buyer pulled
OL,20,Fout due to a lack of confidence.

OL,6,FJoe Bray has run Top Togs, and

OL,8,FHe says trade has dramatically dropped
OL,9,Fbecause of online competition and the

OL,12,FHe said: "The shops we have got in the

OL,14,Fcannot buy stuff on the internet -
OL,15,Fcoffee, hairdressers, I hate to say
