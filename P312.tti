OL,6,FWhilst there is, scientifically, no

OL,8,Fterm that has gained popularity in

OL,12,FWhy is this week expected to be so bad
OL,13,Ffor hay fever sufferers?

OL,6,FThe warm, dry, sunny weather that
OL,7,Fwe've all been enjoying is triggering
OL,8,Fplants to release more pollen while
OL,9,Fthe gentle breeze helps carry those
OL,10,Fpollen grains through the air,
OL,11,Freaching a broader area.
OL,13,FThe lack of rain also means there's
OL,14,Fless moisture in the air to weigh down
OL,15,Fpollen grains, allowing them to travel
OL,16,Ffurther and remain airborne for
OL,17,Flonger, again reaching a greater area.

OL,20,Fthe early morning and late evening.
