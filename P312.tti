OL,12,FPresident Trump has a habit of
OL,13,Fannouncing things before the facts on
OL,14,Fthe ground catch up to his rhetoric.
OL,16,FHe claimed the Fordow nuclear facility
OL,17,Fhad been 'completely and totally
OL,18,Fobliterated' when in fact he didn't
OL,19,Fknow for certain and his officials
OL,20,Flater had to row back the assessment
OL,21,Fto say instead it was severely damaged.

OL,6,FIran is weakened and never wanted a
OL,7,Fdirect conflict with Israel. This
OL,8,Finitiative would seem to provide it
OL,9,Fwith a convenient off-ramp for the
