OL,6,FBoris Johnson's former adviser Dominic
OL,7,FCummings has told ITV News that China
OL,8,Fwants to build a "spy centre" under
OL,9,Fits proposed new embassy in London.
OL,11,FHis comments come as the Government
OL,12,Fpostponed a decision on whether to
OL,13,Fgrant China permission for a "super
OL,14,Fembassy" in the capital.
OL,16,FIn an interview with ITV News'
OL,17,FPolitical Editor Robert Peston,
OL,18,FCummings insisted the new embassy was
OL,19,Fa cover for espionage activity.
