OL,9,FHundreds of families across the UK had
OL,10,Ftheir lives upturned by the Post
OL,11,FOffice scandal, where more than 900
OL,12,Fsub-postmasters were wrongfully
OL,13,Fprosecuted due to faulty accounting
OL,14,Fsoftware.
OL,16,FAt the heart of many of the stories of
OL,17,Fforced bankruptcies and businesses
OL,18,Flost, are children whose lives were
OL,19,Fchanged forever by the false charges
OL,20,Ftheir parents faced, and the strain
OL,21,Fthat brought.

OL,7,FNow, as part of a new campaign, the
OL,8,Fchildren of some former sub-
OL,9,Fpostmasters are seeking compensation -
OL,10,Fand an apology - for the impact the
OL,11,FPost Office had on their lives.
OL,13,FKatie Downey had - for a time - an
OL,14,Fidyllic childhood. Her family ran the
OL,15,Flocal shop and Post Office in the
OL,16,Fpicturesque Lake District village of
OL,17,FHawkshead, where Katie would ride her
OL,18,Fhorse.

OL,12,FForced into bankruptcy by the false

OL,15,Fbut their reputation too, shunned by
