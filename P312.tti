OL,6,FWhat is assisted dying?
OL,8,FAssisted dying refers to the practice
OL,9,Fwhere a person, typically someone
OL,10,Fterminally ill, seeks assistance to
OL,11,Fend their own life.
OL,13,FThere are two main forms of assisted
OL,14,Fdying: euthanasia, where a medical
OL,15,Fprofessional administers a lethal dose
OL,16,Fof medication to the patient, or
OL,17,Fphysician-assisted suicide, when a
OL,18,Fmedical professional provides the
OL,19,Fmeans for the patient to self-
OL,20,Fadminister.

OL,10,Fdying, according to the largest poll
OL,11,Fever conducted.
OL,13,FAround 75% of people said they support
OL,14,Fa change in the law, versus 14% who
OL,15,Fare opposed.
OL,17,F"It offers peace of mind that there
OL,18,Fare options there, nobody has to use
OL,19,Fit but it does derive a comfort," Fran
OL,20,FHall, Dignity in Dying's Campaigns and
