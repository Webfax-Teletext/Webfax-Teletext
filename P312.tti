OL,6,FFarage believes the Tory Party will
OL,7,Fbreak up, and that Reform is therefore
OL,8,Fthe vehicle by which a right-of-centre
OL,9,Fparty will rise again.
OL,11,FHe also said that there is no way he
OL,12,Fcan be bought off by Sunak, since he
OL,13,Fbroadly believes the country went to
OL,14,Fthe dogs after he stood down
OL,15,Fcandidates in 2019 for Boris Johnson.
OL,17,FThe only deal Farage would

OL,20,Fby Sunak in favour of Reform. That is
OL,21,Fnever going to happen, he conceded.
