OL,6,FITV News' Science Correspondent,
OL,7,FMartin Stew explains what is behind
OL,8,Fthe rise in tick numbers.
OL,10,FTicks are tiny eight-legged arachnids
OL,11,Fwhich live in grass, bracken and
OL,12,Fbrambles.
OL,14,FFor most of the year, they lie
OL,15,Fdormant, but for a week, they come out
OL,16,Fto breed and feed on blood. Their
OL,17,Fbites can spread Lyme disease.

OL,6,FFor 15 years, researchers from the UK
OL,7,FHealth and Safety Agency (UKHSA) have
OL,8,Fbeen tracking the spread of ticks and
OL,9,Fmonitoring in a lab how many carry
OL,10,Fdiseases.
OL,12,FThey're noticing the geographic spread
OL,13,Fof areas in which ticks live and how
OL,14,Flong they're active for are both
OL,15,Fincreasing.
OL,17,FThey have linked the rise to an
OL,18,Fincrease in wild deer, which are at
OL,19,Ftheir highest number in 1,000 years,
OL,20,Fand our changing climate.

OL,8,FLyme disease is a bacterial infection
OL,9,Fthat can be spread to humans by
OL,10,Finfected ticks. It's usually easier to

OL,13,FSymptoms of Lyme disease
OL,15,FA circular or oval shape rash around a
OL,16,Ftick bite can be an early symptom of
OL,17,FLyme disease in some people.
