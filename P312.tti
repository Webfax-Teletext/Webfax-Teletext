OL,7,FExplosive cyclogenesis - sometimes
OL,8,Finformally known as 'bombogenesis' or

OL,10,Fto a rapidly deepening area of low

OL,12,Fmillibars in a 24-hour period - and is
OL,13,Foften associated with major winter

OL,16,FHow often does explosive cyclogenesis

OL,19,FProbably only two or three times each
OL,20,Fwinter but rarely so dramatically.

OL,15,FIt's the power in that jet stream that

OL,17,Fto be significantly faster and deeper
OL,18,Fthan we would normally see, leading to
