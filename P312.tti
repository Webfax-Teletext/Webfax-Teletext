OL,8,Fput into administration, after their
OL,9,Fowner said "last-ditch" measures had
OL,10,Ffallen through, putting about 2,500 UK
OL,11,Fstaff at risk of redundancy.
OL,13,FThe two retailers had already

OL,15,Fbought by investment firm Modella
OL,16,FCapital last year.
OL,18,FModella said it had made the "tough
OL,19,Fdecision" to kickstart insolvency
OL,20,Fproceedings for the businesses.
