OL,6,FBut there are more questions than

OL,9,FWas the action legal?
OL,11,FThe Venezuelan authorities say it was
OL,12,Fan act of "barefaced robbery and
OL,13,Finternational piracy". US officials
OL,14,Fsay a US judge signed a warrant,
OL,15,Falthough reportedly that was several
OL,16,Fweeks ago and was in response to the
OL,17,Fship's role in smuggling Iranian - not
OL,18,FVenezuelan - oil.

OL,6,FPresident Donald Trump suggested that
OL,7,Fthe US now would own the oil. But it's
OL,8,Funclear whether that is legal.
OL,10,FThe tanker appears to have been using
OL,11,Fa network of transponders to obscure
OL,12,Fthe ship's location and was carrying
OL,13,FVenezuelan oil to Asia. It was also
OL,14,Foperating under a false flag. So this
OL,15,Fis a legal minefield.
OL,17,FWhat is the purpose of seizing the

OL,6,FPresident Trump has accused Maduro of
OL,7,Fbeing a narco-terrorist. The US has
OL,8,Fmounted a campaign of military
