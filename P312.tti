OL,4,Cthe United States for Ghana
OL,6,FFor those of African descent, 2019 was
OL,7,Fa very special year.
OL,9,FOn a historical note, it marked the
OL,10,F400th anniversary of slaves departing
OL,11,Ffrom the African continent. It was by
OL,12,Fall accounts a dark and painful period
OL,13,Fto be remembered for.
OL,15,FBut amidst that sorrowful reminder, an
OL,16,Fidea was born to invite African
OL,17,Fdiasporas across the globe to settle
OL,18,Fin Ghana, which was once a prolific
OL,19,Fslave state. It was dubbed "The Year
OL,20,Fof Return".
