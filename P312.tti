OL,6,FThe rumours are true.
OL,8,FA heatwave is on the way next week and

OL,11,Fmore than welcome.
OL,13,FEspecially given the underwhelming

OL,6,FOver the next few days temperatures
OL,7,Fwill gradually increase as high

OL,10,FBut it's next week when the real heat
OL,11,Fwill kick in - and here's how it's all
OL,12,Fgoing to happen.
OL,14,FOn the other side of the pond
OL,15,Ftemperatures in some parts of the
OL,16,FUnited States are already soaring.
OL,18,FThis is causing the Atlantic Jet

OL,21,Fatmosphere.

OL,4,Cwill it get?
OL,6,FThe jet stream flows high overhead and
OL,7,Fcauses changes in the wind and
OL,8,Fpressure at that level, watch how it
OL,9,Fwill make its way over to the UK
OL,11,FWhere it buckles and bends always has
OL,12,Fa big sway on the types of weather

OL,15,FNext week we're expecting the jet to
OL,16,Fbuckle up to the north of Britain,
OL,17,Fwhich will cut off the cool arctic air
OL,18,Fon its northern side and allow the
OL,19,Fmuch warmer air across southern Europe
