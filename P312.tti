OL,9,Fcompromised following a hack of a

OL,13,FAn MoD source told ITV News the hack
OL,14,Fhad happened in recent days and hit a

OL,18,FThe department said it acted "very
OL,19,Fswiftly" when it discovered the breach
OL,20,Fby taking the external network -
OL,21,Foperated by a contractor - offline.
