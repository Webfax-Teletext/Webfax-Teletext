OL,6,FRussia's President Vladimir Putin has
OL,7,Fsaid the US-led peace plan to end the
OL,8,Fwar in Ukraine could be a starting
OL,9,Fpoint for talks.
OL,11,FSpeaking during a press conference
OL,12,Ffollowing a three-day visit to
OL,13,FKyrgyzstan, Putin said the plan "could
OL,14,Fform the basis of future agreements".
OL,16,FBut he said it would be "impolite" to
OL,17,F"talk about any final options now,
OL,18,Fsince there aren't any."

OL,10,F"If Ukrainian troops withdraw from the
