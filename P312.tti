OL,6,FSome dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia,
OL,7,Fhave taken part in a research project
OL,8,Fto learn how they use marine sponges
OL,9,Fto hunt the ocean's bed for food.
OL,11,FDolphins in Australia have been
OL,12,Fspotted wearing sponges on their
OL,13,Fnoses, in a special technique to hunt
OL,14,Ffish along the seabed.
OL,16,FUsing the sponge to protect its nose,
OL,17,Fthe dolphin will swim with its beak
OL,18,Fcovered and shovel through rubble on
OL,19,Fthe sandy ocean's bed.
