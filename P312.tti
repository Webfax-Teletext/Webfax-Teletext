OL,6,FThe Great British public have had
OL,7,Ftheir say and they have ruled that the
OL,8,Faction thriller Die Hard is not a
OL,9,FChristmas film.
OL,11,FIn a survey of 2,000 people by the
OL,12,FBritish Board of Film Classification,
OL,13,Fnearly half (44%) said the 1988
OL,14,Fblockbuster starring Bruce Willis did
OL,15,Fnot give them that festive feeling,
OL,16,Fdespite the plot taking place on
OL,17,FChristmas Eve.
OL,19,FMore than a third (38%) disagreed and
OL,20,Fdefended the film's Christmas
OL,21,Fcredentials.
