OL,6,FSo, a member of the Royal Family has
OL,7,Ffinally spoken about the scandal
OL,8,Fsurrounding two of its former members.
OL,10,FTo be clear, the younger brother of
OL,11,FAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor didn't do
OL,12,Fso voluntarily.
OL,14,FPrince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, was
OL,15,Fasked about it, on a stage, at a
OL,16,Fconference in Dubai with a microphone
OL,17,Fhovering next to his mouth.
OL,19,FHe could hardly have said, "Sorry, I'm
OL,20,Fnot going to answer that."
