OL,6,FAccording to NASA, it's because the
OL,7,Fsun's solar cycle is reaching its peak.
OL,9,FThe solar cycle is a natural cycle the
OL,10,Fsun goes through as it transitions
OL,11,Fbetween low and high magnetic
OL,12,Factivity. This happens roughly every
OL,13,F11 years.
OL,15,FDuring the most active part of the
OL,16,Fcycle, known as solar maximum, the sun
OL,17,Fcan unleash immense explosions of
OL,18,Flight, energy, and solar radiation.

OL,13,FThe colours are determined by the type
