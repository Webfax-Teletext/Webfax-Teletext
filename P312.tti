OL,6,FThe concept, half of which I have

OL,8,FTrump's bullying trade tactics -
OL,9,Ftomorrow's announcement by him of
OL,10,Ftariffs on all imports to America - by
OL,11,Fthreatening collectively to impose
OL,12,Ftariffs on America's exports double or
OL,13,Ftreble whatever his tariff rates turn
OL,14,Fout to be.
OL,16,FThis in itself would terrify American

OL,19,Fthe EU, Switzerland, Japan, South

OL,6,FIf simultaneously these countries and

OL,8,Fbetween themselves - to facilitate
OL,9,Fless trade friction in an economic
OL,10,Farea significantly greater than that
OL,11,Fof the US - the potential damage to
OL,12,FAmerican domiciled companies and
OL,13,Finterests would be even more
OL,14,Fsignificant.
OL,16,FThe world would then divide between a
OL,17,Fnewly thriving economic area of pretty
OL,18,Fmuch all developed democracies apart
OL,19,Ffrom the US - the G7 minus one, as it
OL,20,Fwere - and a protectionist and

OL,6,FObviously this would look like the
OL,7,Fmother of all trade wars. Markets
OL,8,Fmight in the short term take serious
OL,9,Ffright.
OL,11,FBut the current response to Trump -
OL,12,Feach nation or trading region seeking
OL,13,Findividually to buy or warn Trump off
OL,14,F- is massively sub optimal. It allows
OL,15,FTrump to divide and rule.
OL,17,FThe best chance of him backing down
OL,18,Fwould come if the combined voice of
OL,19,FAmerican businesses and banks were a
OL,20,Fhowl of pain at being locked out of
