OL,6,FDespite it being the largest drone
OL,7,Fstrike in history, the attack was seen
OL,8,Fas ineffective with Israeli and US air
OL,9,Fdefence systems destroying most of
OL,10,Fthem before they hit their target.
OL,12,FA key factor in its failure was the
OL,13,Fdrone's speed, with over 1,000 miles
OL,14,Fto travel from Iran to Israel the
OL,15,Frelatively slow-moving drones were

OL,6,FThe attack on Tuesday night was
OL,7,Fdifferent because it involved mostly
OL,8,Fballistic missiles able to travel at
OL,9,Fhypersonic speed (up to 25 times the
OL,10,Fspeed of sound) covering the distance
OL,11,Fin a much shorter time.
OL,13,FThe impact of the speed difference can

OL,6,FIn the October strike, the facts are
OL,7,Fnot yet clear, with Iran claiming 80%
OL,8,Fof their missiles hit their targets
OL,9,Fbut Israel has claimed many of them

OL,12,FIt is believed around 200 ballistic
OL,13,Fmissiles were used in Tuesday's
OL,14,Fattack, out of an estimated Iranian
OL,15,Fstockpile of roughly 3,000.
OL,17,FIran also has thousands of cruise
OL,18,Fmissiles and strike drones in their
OL,19,Farsenal, but these take longer to get
OL,20,Fto Israel.
