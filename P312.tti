OL,6,FThe Conservatives have announced they
OL,7,Fwould introduce a social media ban for
OL,8,Funder-16s if they came into power.
OL,10,FKemi Badenoch, the party's leader,
OL,11,Fsaid that platforms were profiting
OL,12,Ffrom children's "anxiety" and
OL,13,F"distraction" and were "designed to be
OL,14,Faddictive".
OL,16,FShe said she did not like the word
OL,17,Fban, but wanted to see an age limit
OL,18,Fintroduced, following the success of a
OL,19,Fsimilar move in Australia last month.
