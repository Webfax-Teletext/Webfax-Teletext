OL,6,FIn October, Chancellor Rachel Reeves
OL,7,Fset out plans for almost #70 billion a
OL,8,Fyear of extra public spending, funded
OL,9,Fthrough tax rises and increased
OL,10,Fborrowing.
OL,12,FThe OECD said on Wednesday that
OL,13,Finterest rates, which currently sit at
OL,14,F4.75%, are expected to fall back to
OL,15,F3.5% by early 2026.
OL,17,FHowever, it said higher consumption,
OL,18,Fpartly caused by the autumn Budget,
OL,19,Fmeant this is not as sharp a drop as
OL,20,Fpreviously forecast.
