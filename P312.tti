OL,9,FPeople in Britain aged between 40 and
OL,10,F73 have until April to potentially
OL,11,Fboost their state pension by thousands
OL,12,Fof pounds.
OL,14,FThey can do so by checking their
OL,15,FNational Insurance (NI) records and
OL,16,Ffilling in any gaps going back as far
OL,17,Fas April 2006.

OL,9,Fthey retire.
OL,11,FWhy does the number of National

OL,14,FConsumer expert Martin Lewis says
OL,15,FNational Insurance is a bit like a

OL,6,FThe more tokens you get, the bigger
OL,7,Fthe proportion of the weekly state

OL,10,Fcurrently stands at #221.20 per week.
OL,12,FTo qualify for a "token" in any given
OL,13,Ftax year, you have to have sufficient
OL,14,FNational Insurance credit for that
OL,15,Fyear.
OL,17,FYou need at least 10 qualifying NI

OL,20,FTo get the full state pension, you
OL,21,Fneed around 35 qualifying NI years.
