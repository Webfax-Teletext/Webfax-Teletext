OL,6,FPresident Joe Biden and Trump spoke by
OL,7,Fphone late on Saturday night. It was a
OL,8,Fmoment of civility between two bitter
OL,9,Ffoes.
OL,11,FBut online, it is a different story.
OL,12,FThe toxicity is extremely disturbing.
OL,14,FMany Trump supporters are claiming on
OL,15,Fvarious social media platforms that
OL,16,Fthis was the Deep State plot trying to
OL,17,Fstop Trump's return to the White House.
OL,19,FCongressman Mike Collins, from
OL,20,FGeorgia, claimed that "Joe Biden sent
OL,21,Fthe orders" to the assassin.
