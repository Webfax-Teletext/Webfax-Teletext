OL,8,Fhopes for a ceasefire despite fears of
OL,9,Fnew offensive in Gaza
OL,11,FThe news kept coming from Israel and
OL,12,FGaza.
OL,14,FOver the course of twelve hours
OL,15,Fyesterday, a series of developments
OL,16,Fappeared to push the entire region
OL,17,Ftowards a state of heightened fear,

OL,6,FThe morning after, it is now clear
OL,7,Fthat none of those dramatic events
OL,8,Fwere as consequential as they appeared
OL,9,Fat first sight.
OL,11,FIn Cairo, Doha, and Washington DC -
OL,12,Fthe key capitals through which

OL,14,Finfluenced - the biggest optimists

OL,6,FBut that, in turn, suggests they are
OL,7,Fstill trying to shape conditions for a
OL,8,Fdeal this week, according to three
OL,9,Fdiplomatic sources with sight on the
OL,10,Fnegotiations.
OL,12,FFirst came an evacuation order issued

OL,13,FMonday afternoon's wave of unexpected

OL,15,Fannouncement by Hamas that it had
OL,16,Faccepted a ceasefire deal.
OL,18,FThere were small celebrations in the

OL,6,FBut then came the important context:
