OL,6,FThe first ever Humanoid Robot Games
OL,7,Fgot underway on Friday in Beijing, as
OL,8,FITV News Asia Correspondent Debi
OL,9,FEdwards reports
OL,11,FIt had been billed as the Olympics for
OL,12,FRobots, and was even being held at one
OL,13,Fof Beijing's previous Winter Olympic
OL,14,Fvenues.
OL,16,FThe stage was set for a sporting event
OL,17,Flike no other - and it kicked off on
OL,18,Fthe track with the 1,500 metres.

OL,6,FThat's perhaps when we started to
OL,7,Fquestion the comparison between the
OL,8,Ffirst World Humanoid Robot Games and
OL,9,Fthe Olympics.
OL,11,FOne robot, from the Chinese company
OL,12,FUnitree, streaked ahead, while many of
OL,13,Fthe others struggled to make the
OL,14,Fdistance or just took too long.
OL,16,FSeveral would have had grounds to
OL,17,Fcomplain about the ill-fitting running
OL,18,Fshoes wedged onto their feet. I
OL,19,Fspotted blatant signs of fixing and
OL,20,Fone team was running with a can of
OL,21,FWD40 in hand.

OL,6,FJust when you thought they were down
OL,7,Ffor the count, they would spring back
