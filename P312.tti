OL,6,F"At this juncture, the XEC variant

OL,9,Fdirector of the Scripps Research
OL,10,FTranslational Institute in California,
OL,11,Fsaid in a post on X.
OL,13,FHowever, it will take "many weeks, a

OL,15,Fhold and starts to cause a wave," Dr
OL,16,FTopol told the LA Times.
OL,18,F"It would be surprising if this
OL,19,Fdoesn't turn out to be the next
OL,20,Fchallenge," he added.
