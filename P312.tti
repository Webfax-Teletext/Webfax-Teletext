OL,6,FONS attributed the rise in inflation
OL,7,Fto last month's increase in petrol
OL,8,Fprices.
OL,10,FGrant Fitzner, the ONS's chief
OL,11,Feconomist, explained: "Inflation rose
OL,12,Fagain this month as prices of motor
OL,13,Ffuel and clothing increased this year
OL,14,Fbut fell a year ago.
OL,16,F"This was partially offset by air
