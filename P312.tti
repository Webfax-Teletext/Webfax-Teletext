OL,8,FLebanon. It has been designated a
OL,9,Fterrorist group by many Western

OL,12,FIt was founded in 1982 after the
OL,13,FLebanon War, which saw Israel occupy
OL,14,Fmuch of the south of Lebanon.
OL,16,FThe group specifically set out to copy
OL,17,Fthe model of Ayatollah Khomeini's
OL,18,FIranian Revolution in 1979. Like
