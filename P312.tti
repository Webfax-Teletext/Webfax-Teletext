OL,9,Fthe weekend, following mild conditions
OL,10,Fearlier in the week - a switch-up in

OL,13,FWhy is it colder on Monday?
OL,15,FAs high pressure (our old friend we
OL,16,Fhad through most of the spring and
OL,17,Fsummer) re-establishes itself from the
OL,18,Fwest, there will be a change into a
OL,19,F'polar maritime' air mass, with wet,
OL,20,Fcold air bringing cold showery weather.

OL,19,FSeptember 22, at 7.19pm BST, and is
OL,20,Fknown as nature's marker for the start
