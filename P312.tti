OL,6,FThe 2024 Olympics are over, and with
OL,7,Fthat, attentions now shift towards the
OL,8,FParis Paralympic Games which will kick-
OL,9,Foff in just over a week.
OL,11,FParalympic athletes will be entering
OL,12,Fthe last stage of their preparations
OL,13,Fahead of the Games, but one little-
OL,14,Fknown rule could stop some of them
OL,15,Fcompeting altogether.
OL,17,FIt has become a rite of passage for
OL,18,FOlympians to get a tattoo of the
OL,19,Ficonic rings, forever commemorating
OL,20,Ftheir performance and participation.

OL,6,FHowever, for Paralympians, those
OL,7,Fdisplaying the five rings could be
OL,8,Fpunished if they fail to cover up
OL,9,Ftheir body art.
OL,11,FRetired Paralympian Josef Craig was on
OL,12,Fthe receiving end of this obscure rule
OL,13,Fahead of the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games
OL,14,Fwhen he was penalised for showing the
OL,15,Frings tattoo on his chest.
OL,17,FThe British swimmer was competing in

OL,6,FBut, despite his performance in the

OL,10,FWhy the difference in rules between
OL,11,Fthe Olympics and Paralympics?
OL,13,FThe difference in rules comes down to
OL,14,Fboth Games having a different
OL,15,Fgoverning body.
OL,17,FThe International Paralympic Committee
OL,18,F(IPC) forbids athletes from "body

OL,20,Ffalling under that purview.

OL,6,FEssentially the Olympic rings are just
OL,7,Fthat, the logo of the Olympics and not
OL,8,Fthat of the Paralympics.
OL,10,FThe Paralympics has its own symbol,
