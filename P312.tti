OL,6,FPeople in Israel have several
OL,7,Fdifferent options when it comes to
OL,8,Faccessing safe places if a strike is
OL,9,Fimminent, depending on the time it
OL,10,Ftakes to reach shelter.
OL,12,FThe first priority upon hearing a

OL,15,Fknown as MAMADs or MAMAKs.
OL,17,FA MAMAD is a secure room within a

OL,19,Frefers to a secure space on each floor
