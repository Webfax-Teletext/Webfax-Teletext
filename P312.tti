OL,6,FNew York City residents will have to
OL,7,Fplace their rubbish bags in wheelie
OL,8,Fbins rather than leaving them on the
OL,9,Fstreet - in what the city's mayor
OL,10,Fcalled a "trash revolution" and a
OL,11,F"game changer" for the city.
OL,13,FWhilst rubbish bins are a norm for
OL,14,Fmost people in the UK and across the
OL,15,Fworld, those in New York City will now
OL,16,Fbe required to put their rubbish in
OL,17,Fdedicated bins for the first time.
