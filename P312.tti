OL,6,FThere have always been hugely
OL,7,Fcontroversial issues that have caused
OL,8,Fpeople to get very angry with MPs.
OL,10,FI remember being tasked on one of my

OL,12,Fnewspaper 20 years ago with going
OL,13,Fthrough furious letters from readers
OL,14,Fshocked that the paper had just backed
OL,15,Fthe Iraq War.
OL,17,FAnd if they were that angry with the

OL,19,Ffelt about the Labour politicians and
OL,20,FPM making the decisions.
