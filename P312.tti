OL,8,Fcoming from Downing Street on
OL,9,FTuesday's News At Ten
OL,11,FWe are witnessing full-on Downing
OL,12,FStreet chaos tonight, which has led
OL,13,Fthe official spokesman for Health
OL,14,FSecretary Wes Streeting, to give me a
OL,15,Fformal statement, denying claims that
OL,16,FStreeting is plotting behind the
OL,17,Fscenes to oust the PM as
OL,18,F"categorically untrue".
OL,20,FSo many aspects of this are comic.

OL,6,FBut my favourite is that Kitty Ussher,
OL,7,Fwho used to be a Labour Treasury
OL,8,Fminister and is now a senior director
OL,9,Fat Barclays, gave a presentation to
OL,10,Fall Labour special advisers, at the
OL,11,Finvitation of Downing Street
OL,12,Fofficials, in which she said
OL,13,Fgovernment bond prices were depressed
OL,14,Fbecause investors fear that Starmer
OL,15,Fand Reeves would be ousted.
OL,17,FThe message from Ussher was "be loyal
OL,18,For government borrowing costs will go
OL,19,Fthrough the roof".

OL,9,FOut of an almost clear blue sky,
OL,10,FDowning Street officials are warning
OL,11,Fthat the plotters are out to get
OL,12,FStarmer and Reeves, and that Starmer
OL,13,Fwill fight them to the death.
OL,15,FMaybe they know something about an

OL,17,Ffrom the rest of us? That is possible.
