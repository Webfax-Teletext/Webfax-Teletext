OL,6,FLast week, the Scottish government
OL,7,Fannounced a national review into
OL,8,Fgrooming gangs to understand the scale
OL,9,Fof the abuse in Scotland, but Taylor
OL,10,Fand other victims say the review
OL,11,Fdoesn't go far enough.
OL,13,FThey are concerned about the
OL,14,Findependence of the review if it is to
OL,15,Fbe led by the Care Inspectorate and
OL,16,FHis Majesty's Inspectorate of
OL,17,FConstabulary in Scotland, a Scottish
OL,18,Fgovernment body that provides scrutiny
OL,19,Fof Police Scotland to the Scottish
