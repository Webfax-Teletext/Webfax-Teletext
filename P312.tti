OL,7,FVladimir Putin is seeking full control
OL,8,Fover Ukraine's eastern regions of
OL,9,FDonetsk and Luhansk, which are known
OL,10,Ftogether as the Donbas.
OL,12,FRussia already controls almost all of
OL,13,Fthe Luhansk region, but Ukraine is
OL,14,Festimated to still hold onto around
OL,15,F30% of Donetsk.
OL,17,FThe area is of strategic importance to
OL,18,FUkraine, with strongly fortified
OL,19,Fcities like Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and
OL,20,FKostiantynivka acting as a barrier to
OL,21,FRussian forces.
