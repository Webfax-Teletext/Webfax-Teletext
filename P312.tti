OL,10,FOver the course of the past 60 years,
OL,11,Fit's been transformed by immigration.
OL,13,FAnd in the process, its people have

OL,7,FIt was a speech that cost Powell his

OL,9,Ffurther mainstream debate about
OL,10,Fimmigration.
OL,12,FMeanwhile, Wolverhampton continued to

OL,11,FBut, over this past year or so, we

OL,7,FWolverhampton-born writer Sathnam

OL,12,F"There are different things going on.
OL,13,FIf you look at our party politics,
OL,14,Fthat tells a very toxic story. If you
