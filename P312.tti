OL,6,FDonald Trump couldn't have made his

OL,9,FHamas must release all hostages by
OL,10,Finauguration day, or "all hell will

OL,6,FYes, the hard yards of talks have been
OL,7,Fcarried out by Secretary of State
OL,8,FAnthony Blinken, but getting both
OL,9,Fsides to sign off finally will be an
OL,10,Fachievement for which Donald Trump
OL,11,Fwill try to take credit.
OL,13,FBoth sides may want to take a deal now

OL,16,FHamas is weakened and knows its allies
OL,17,Fin Lebanon, Hezbollah, are also

OL,6,FTheir sponsor, Iran, has also suffered
OL,7,Fstrategic setbacks. Israel also has
OL,8,Fits reasons for taking the deal now.
OL,9,FBenjamin Netanyahu has more members in
OL,10,Fhis coalition and, therefore, more

OL,13,FBut both sides also can't second guess

OL,6,FTrump will be keen to take credit for

OL,10,FHowever, as former State Department
OL,11,Fofficial Aaron David Miller told me

OL,13,Fwill be implemented under Trump's
