OL,6,FBy ITV News Correspondent Robert Moore
OL,8,FWe are now about to discover the
OL,9,Fanswer to the greatest question in
OL,10,FAmerican politics: Can Donald Trump
OL,11,Fpull off another improbable victory,
OL,12,Fconfounding the establishment once
OL,13,Fmore?
OL,15,FHe is likely destined for federal-
OL,16,Ffunded housing either way. But will it
OL,17,Fbe the White House? Or a prison cell?
OL,18,FRemember, if he loses the election, he
OL,19,Ffaces immense legal jeopardy in
OL,20,Fmultiple cases.

OL,6,FThe final polling shows a dead heat,
OL,7,Fwith paths to victory for both Trump
OL,8,Fand Kamala Harris. But the political
OL,9,Fclass - the pundits, the analysts, the
OL,10,FWashington insiders - believe that
OL,11,FTrump has framed his closing argument
OL,12,Fso badly - and offended so many
OL,13,Fcritical voting groups - that he is
OL,14,Flikely to lose both the popular vote
OL,15,Fand the Electoral College.

OL,6,FTrump has struggled to stay on message
OL,7,Fthroughout the campaign and has driven
OL,8,Fhis handlers and advisers mad with
OL,9,Ffrustration for his lack of discipline
OL,10,Fand rambling performances at his
OL,11,Frallies.
OL,13,FBut there is still a way for him to
OL,14,Fwin. That path requires another 2016-
OL,15,Fstyle uprising by disillusioned
OL,16,Fworking class voters who feel betrayed
OL,17,Fby the Washington establishment. We
OL,18,Ffind these voters all across America,
OL,19,Fand there grievances are real.
