OL,6,FIn a post on his Truth Social platform
OL,7,Fon Friday, Trump said the European
OL,8,FUnion had "very difficult to deal
OL,9,Fwith" and that discussions with the
OL,10,Fbloc were proving unproductive.
OL,12,F"Therefore, I am recommending a

OL,14,FUnion, starting on June 1, 2025," he
OL,15,Fwrote.
OL,17,FHis threat was accompanied by a demand
OL,18,Fthat Apple make its iPhones in the
OL,19,FUnited States or face a 25% tariff.

OL,6,FThe insistence by the Republican
