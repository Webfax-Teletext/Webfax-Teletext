OL,6,FEarlier this year, the government
OL,7,Fannounced it would launch a statutory
OL,8,Finquiry into the grooming gangs
OL,9,Fscandal.
OL,11,FIt came after months of pressure to
OL,12,Fimplement a full national probe, after
OL,13,Fa series of local inquiries into the
OL,14,Fissue, including in Rotherham and
OL,15,FRochdale.
OL,17,FSo far, attempts to appoint someone to
OL,18,Fchair the inquiry have failed, and
OL,19,Fseveral grooming gang survivors have
OL,20,Fresigned from their roles in the
OL,21,Fliaison panel.

OL,14,Fgrooming gangs.

OL,18,Flooked into grooming gangs across the

OL,10,Fas well as improving data collection
