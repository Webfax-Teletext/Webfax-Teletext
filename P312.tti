OL,11,Fthrough, the similarities between the

OL,6,FThere are some key reasons as to why
OL,7,Fmore adults are getting diagnosed with
OL,8,Fautism, UCL's Professor Stott
OL,9,Fexplained, including a history of
OL,10,Funderdiagnosis and changes to the
OL,11,Fcriteria that allow for somebody to be
OL,12,Fdiagnosed as autistic.
OL,14,F"There's been a widening of what being
OL,15,Fautistic is, which then means that
OL,16,Fmore people perhaps fall into that
OL,17,Fbracket than would have done under
OL,18,Fprevious diagnostic criteria," he said.

OL,6,FResearch has also typically focused on
