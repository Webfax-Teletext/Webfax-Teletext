OL,7,FThe British Medical Association (BMA)
OL,8,Fhas accused Wes Streeting of
OL,9,F"scaremongering", after he warned that
OL,10,Fstrikes before Christmas could push
OL,11,Fthe NHS to collapse as it grapples
OL,12,Fwith the winter flu outbreak.
OL,14,FThe doctors' union claimed the Health
OL,15,FSecretary has been "utterly
OL,16,Firresponsible in the way he is
OL,17,Fexploiting patients and public fears",
OL,18,Fand that he was "laying the blame" of

OL,20,Fhimself.
