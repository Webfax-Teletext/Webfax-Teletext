OL,3,CWhy Trump is Starmer's worst nightmare
OL,5,FSir Keir Starmer routinely describes
OL,6,Fhis friendly relations with Donald
OL,7,FTrump as a great asset to the UK.
OL,9,FTrump himself though, is a living
OL,10,Fnightmare for the British prime
OL,11,Fminister and his ambitions to revive
OL,12,Fhis and his party's fortunes.
OL,14,FOne reason is that every time Trump
OL,15,Fexecutes one of his "I-can't-believe-
OL,16,Fhe-just-did-that" policies, nothing
OL,17,Fthat Starmer says or does is heard by
OL,18,Fanyone.

OL,8,Fcost of living.
OL,10,FBut did you notice him in Reading this

OL,14,FThe reality is that Starmer is
OL,15,Fcorrect, that to do so would be self
