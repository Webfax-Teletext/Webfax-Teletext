OL,6,Fevery member of the cabinet -
OL,7,Fchancellor, foreign secretary, deputy
OL,8,Fpm, et al, and even the ousted deputy
OL,9,Fleader Angela Rayner - putting out
OL,10,Fstatements or going on TV to tell us
OL,11,Fhow lucky we are to have Keir Starmer
OL,12,Fas prime minister.
OL,14,FWhich is never a good look for a prime
OL,15,Fminister. It smacks of utter panic as
OL,16,Fthe good ship Labour government heads
OL,17,Fremorselessly for the eye of the storm.
OL,19,FStarmer's payroll colleagues may well

OL,5,FThis is why Labour's leader in

OL,7,Fsomething unique: he has called on

OL,10,Felections to the Scottish parliament
OL,11,Fif Starmer remains PM.
OL,13,FSarwar felt he had no choice but to
OL,14,Fdetach Scottish Labour from UK Labour,
OL,15,Fbecause Scottish voters don't want to
OL,16,Ftouch Starmer with a several-hundred-
