OL,3,C'I collapsed on mile 24':The dangers
OL,4,Cof taking ibuprofen before a marathon
OL,6,FBy Alice O'Connell, ITV News Assistant
OL,7,FProducer
OL,9,FMax Laing, 23, ran his first marathon
OL,10,Fin April 2024, but after taking an
OL,11,Fibuprofen tablet to treat knee
OL,12,Fdiscomfort, he collapsed during his
OL,13,Fpenultimate mile and woke up in a
OL,14,Fmedical tent.
OL,16,F"I remember people standing above me,
OL,17,Fbut no faces just voices, trying to
OL,18,Fexplain to me what they were doing and
OL,19,Fwhy I was submerged in an ice jacket",
OL,20,FMax explained.

OL,3,C'I collapsed on mile 24':The dangers
OL,4,Cof taking ibuprofen before a marathon
OL,6,FThe ibuprofen Max took had triggered a
OL,7,Fheat stroke, causing rhabdomialaysis -
OL,8,Fa serious medical condition where the
OL,9,Fbreakdown of muscle tissue leads to
OL,10,Fthe release of muscle contents into
OL,11,Fthe bloodstream.
OL,13,FThis release can cause various
OL,14,Fcomplications, including kidney damage
OL,15,Fand potentially life-threatening
OL,16,Fconditions like acute kidney failure.
OL,18,FMax was moved to the kidney unit for a
OL,19,Ffurther two weeks. After three weeks
OL,20,Fin hospital, Max was released, but the
OL,21,Feffects of his heat stroke persisted.

OL,7,Faren't the only option for treating
OL,8,Fpre-marathon pain.
OL,10,F"Paracetamol is a really good
OL,11,Fpainkiller. And something like

OL,14,F"The amounts of those drugs that get

OL,16,Freally low. But the amounts that gets
