OL,4,CParkinson's disease diagnosis
OL,6,F"It's very frustrating sometimes,
OL,7,Fparticularly (when) people are
OL,8,Fconstantly saying to you, 'Sorry, what
OL,9,Fdid you say?' And you have to repeat
OL,10,Fyourself, time and time again.
OL,12,F"I am fairly pragmatic about the
OL,13,Fprospect of this getting worse. I try
OL,14,Fto remain positive, because what's the
OL,15,Fpoint of not being?"
OL,17,FHis son, Nick, said that despite the
OL,18,Fdiagnosis being "really upsetting" it
OL,19,Fdid not come as a surprise considering
OL,20,Fhis grandmother also had the disease.
