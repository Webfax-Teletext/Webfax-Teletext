OL,6,FSTEVE - or the 'Strong Thermal
OL,7,FEmission Velocity Enhancement' - often
OL,8,Fappears during the Northern Lights.
OL,10,FHowever, scientists say it is a much
OL,11,Fmore unique celestial event which is
OL,12,Ffundamentally different from auroras.
OL,14,FWhilst auroras are more oval in shape;
OL,15,FSTEVE appears as more of a ribbon.
OL,17,FSTEVE is also more unpredictable and
OL,18,Flasts only 20 minutes to an hour,
OL,19,Fmeaning sightings are rare.

OL,6,FIt is a relatively new scientific

OL,8,Fwhat exactly causes its unique shape.
OL,10,FHowever, weather experts believe a
OL,11,Ffast-moving stream of extremely hot
OL,12,Fparticles or gases called a sub-
OL,13,Fauroral ion drift could be the cause,
OL,14,Frather than the protons and electrons
OL,15,Fwhich cause the auroras.
OL,17,FAurora sightings are more frequent at

OL,20,Fare experiencing more geomagnetic
