OL,6,FIn October, Deputy Mary Le Hegarat,
OL,7,Fthe Minister for Justice and Home
OL,8,FAffairs, questioned the utility of the
OL,9,Fcurrent law after the police were
OL,10,Funable to prosecute an unlicensed lift
OL,11,Fshare.
OL,13,FThe Minister stated: "The most recent

OL,15,Fdriver allegedly offering lifts for
OL,16,Freward resulted in an acquittal,
OL,17,Fbringing into question the adequacy of

OL,13,FIn response, Deputy Curtis said,
