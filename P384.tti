OL,8,Fsupport for children living with Fetal
OL,9,FAlcohol Spectrum Disorder - known as
OL,10,FFASD.
OL,12,FThe condition, which can be the result
OL,13,Fof an alcohol-exposed pregnancy,
OL,14,Faffects the central nervous system and

OL,17,FAndrew Wright's adopted son, Rylie,

OL,19,Fbeing exposed to alcohol before birth.

OL,6,FHe explains: "I noticed something

OL,8,Fschool, where the environment became
OL,9,Fmore structured, and that's when I
OL,10,Fstarted asking questions about whether

OL,14,FFASD is a lifelong neurodevelopmental
OL,15,Fdisability which affects the central
OL,16,Fnervous system and brain development.
OL,17,FThe condition can also impact the
OL,18,Fentire body, including internal and
