OL,6,FThere is some optimism from the UK
OL,7,Fthat the Channel Islands could make
OL,8,Fthe difference in Donald Trump's trade
OL,9,Fwars.
OL,11,FThree weeks since becoming US
OL,12,FPresident, Trump has threatened to
OL,13,Fimpose import tariffs on many
OL,14,Fcountries which have a trade deficit.
OL,16,FHe has already levied Chinese goods by
OL,17,F10% but delayed plans to impose
OL,18,Ftariffs on US imports from Canada and
OL,19,FMexico.

OL,8,FIslands' financial dominance
OL,9,Fpotentially playing a factor in his
OL,10,Fdecision.
OL,12,FAccording to the UK, it has a trade
OL,13,Fsurplus of #71.4 billion with the US -
OL,14,Fmeaning it sells more to America than
