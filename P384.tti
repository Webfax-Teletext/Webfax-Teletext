OL,6,FJersey marine expert, Dr Paul

OL,8,Fthe Channel Islands sound different to
OL,9,Fthose in other parts of the world.
OL,11,FDr Chambers told ITV News: "One of the
OL,12,Ffunny things is that dolphins seem to
OL,13,Fhave regional accents.
OL,15,F"You can't compare directly the noise
OL,16,Fthat say a bottlenose dolphin in
OL,17,FJersey or the Channel Islands makes to
OL,18,Fone in, say, Wales or Ireland."

OL,10,FMost noises made by dolphins are
