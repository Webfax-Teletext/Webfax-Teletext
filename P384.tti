OL,6,FSpeaking exclusively to ITV Channel,
OL,7,FDaniel says: "It was quite the step up
OL,8,Ffrom a few marches in Royal Square to
OL,9,Fstanding up in the conference hall.
OL,11,F"But it's been good in Jersey to be
OL,12,Fable to speak to people who are also
OL,13,Fsupportive of the cause and I think
OL,14,Fthat was part of the reason why I had
OL,15,Fthe courage to stand up and say it."
OL,17,FDaniel acknowledged that "a few
OL,18,Fseconds of interruption of a speech is
OL,19,Fnot going to end the war" but called
OL,20,Fon others to continue to speak out.

OL,11,FAfter the interuption, Starmer
OL,12,Fresponded: "This guy's obviously got a

OL,14,Fis thought to have alluded to Jeremy
