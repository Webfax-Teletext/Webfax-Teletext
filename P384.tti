OL,10,FDr Melissa McCullough resigned from

OL,6,FAt the time, Dr McCullough argued that
OL,7,F"a Commissioner cannot uphold
OL,8,Fstandards in a system where standards
OL,9,Fare not seen to be upheld".
OL,11,FShe added: "This can signal to the
OL,12,Fpublic that the Assembly is unwilling
OL,13,Fto enforce consequences and ensure
OL,14,Faccountability."
OL,16,FHowever, her temporary successor has
OL,17,Fnow been announced by the States'
OL,18,FAssembly and Constitution Committee
OL,19,F(SACC), so oversight can continue
OL,20,Fwhile a review of the Code of Conduct
