OL,6,FCurrently, those who leave the UK
OL,7,Fafter at least three years of
OL,8,Fcontributing to their state pension,
OL,9,Foften through National Insurance on
OL,10,Fwages, have to pay #182 annually for a
OL,11,Ftotal of 35 years to qualify for a
OL,12,Ffull rate when they retire.
OL,14,FHowever, from April 2026, state
OL,15,Fpension contributions will rise to
OL,16,F#910 a year, and people will now need
OL,17,Fto live and work in the UK
OL,18,Fcontinuously for 10 years to access
OL,19,Fthe state pension.

OL,6,FWhile the rise is significant, Timothy

OL,8,Fand Corporate Consulting at
OL,9,FAlexforbes, says the investment is
OL,10,Fstill worthwhile for people who can

OL,13,FHe explains: "It used to be a must
OL,14,Fcontribution, since it was a
OL,15,Frelatively low cost on an annual
OL,16,Fbasis, but now it's going to cost
OL,17,Fmore, so you need to consider it
OL,18,Fclosely."
