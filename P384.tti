OL,10,FThe Danish firm, taking over from
OL,11,FCondor, says the cancellations on
OL,12,FFriday 28 March are due to "technical
OL,13,Fissues" with preparing one of their
OL,14,Fferries, the Tarifa Jet, to run to and
OL,15,Ffrom Jersey.
OL,17,FThe company sent a statement Friday
OL,18,Fmorning saying that a revised schedule
OL,19,Fhas been updated with the Stena Vinga
OL,20,Fcovering the route between Jersey and

OL,6,FChris Parker, DFDS's Route Director
OL,7,Ffor Jersey, said: "I am sorry that we

OL,10,Fpeople were looking forward to
OL,11,Fexperiencing DFDS's services for the

OL,13,Fplans to get away for longer breaks.
OL,15,F"Obviously, this was not the start we
OL,16,Fhad hoped for, but we will do our very
OL,17,Fbest to minimize disruptions.
OL,19,F"We are contacting all affected
