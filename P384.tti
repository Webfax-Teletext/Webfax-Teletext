OL,6,FIn the afternoon, States of Jersey's
OL,7,Fofficial analyst Nick Hubbard, who
OL,8,Fspecialises in blood-alcohol analysis,
OL,9,Ftook to the stand.
OL,11,FThe day after the incident (Sunday 6
OL,12,FAugust 2023), Pounds was first
OL,13,Fbreathalysed at 1:09pm, with a blood
OL,14,Fsample taken at 2:47pm, but no alcohol
OL,15,Fwas detected.
OL,17,FMr Hubbard was asked by the
OL,18,Fprosecution to determine how likely
OL,19,FPounds was to be over the legal limit
OL,20,Fwhen driving the night before at
OL,21,F9:40pm.

OL,6,FUsing the defendant's age, height,
OL,7,Fweight, and gender as variables, Mr
OL,8,FHubbard provided three statistical
OL,9,Festimations that worked out the rate
OL,10,Fof absorption and elimination of
OL,11,Falcohol in Pounds' system. All three
OL,12,Festimations put Pounds over the legal
OL,13,Flimit during the crash.
OL,15,FThe prosecution asked Mr Hubbard how
OL,16,Flikely the defendant was under the
OL,17,Fprescribed legal limit, to which Mr
OL,18,FHubbard told the court it was very
OL,19,Funlikely that would have been
OL,20,Fpossible, but added there was a very
OL,21,Fsmall chance.
