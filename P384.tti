OL,6,FThe rising cost of stamps is being

OL,11,FAccording to Jersey Post, there's been
OL,12,Fa steady decline in the volume of
OL,13,FChristmas post passing through the
OL,14,Fservice since the pandemic.
OL,16,FWhilst 1 million items were sent in
OL,17,F2021, this year they expect to deliver

OL,10,FThe price of postage has increased

OL,13,FAlison Baker, owner of Hallmark card

OL,15,Ftrends since the pandemic.
OL,17,FShe says: "We've actually stopped

OL,20,Fdifficult because they suddenly became
OL,21,Fso expensive last year.

OL,6,F"It got embarrassing to sell a

OL,10,F"I think that has put people off -
