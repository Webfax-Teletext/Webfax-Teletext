OL,8,FMinister for International
OL,9,FDevelopment, Deputy Carolyn Labey.
OL,11,FDeputy Labey says: "We hope to
OL,12,Fstrengthen a sense of community and
OL,13,Fcitizenship in Jersey through this
OL,14,Fconsultation, while commemorating our
OL,15,Fheritage and history. It would be

OL,17,Fday and Jersey anthem in time for the
OL,18,F80th anniversary of Liberation Day
OL,19,Fnext year."

OL,6,FThe song 'Beautiful Jersey' is already
OL,7,Fviewed by many as our anthem and has
OL,8,Fbeen used at public and sporting
OL,9,Fevents for some time. However, it has
OL,10,Fnever been officially agreed as such.
OL,12,FDeputy Labey adds: "Adopting 9 May as
OL,13,Fan official national day will not
OL,14,Fchange the way Liberation Day is
OL,15,Fcelebrated, but it will help
OL,16,Fjurisdictions around the world better
OL,17,Funderstand its importance to
OL,18,FIslanders."
