OL,6,FThe family of a Jersey man who
OL,7,Fsuffered a fatal cardiac arrest while
OL,8,Fin the care of medics have spoken out
OL,9,Ffor the first time.
OL,11,FFrazer Irvine, 39, died in March 2022,
OL,12,Fwhilst in the care of ambulance
OL,13,Ftechnician Tom Le Sauteur, 36, and
OL,14,Fparamedic John Sutherland, 61.
OL,16,FLe Sauteur and Sutherland were found
OL,17,Fguilty of failing to provide
OL,18,Freasonable care to Mr Irvine in the
OL,19,Fmoments before his death.
