OL,10,FThe quote on pollack was introduced
OL,11,Fthis year to help recover from

OL,14,FHowever, Channel Island industry

OL,6,FCurrently, the quota for boats under

OL,8,Fto around #400 worth of pollack.
OL,10,FHowever, fuel for a day's fishing can

OL,14,FDougal Lane said: "I won't earn
