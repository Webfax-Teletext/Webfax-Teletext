OL,6,FThe Ports of Jersey has placed nearly
OL,7,F50,000 mature oysters into St Helier
OL,8,FHarbour to improve water quality.
OL,10,FEach of the shellfish is able to
OL,11,Ffilter up to 190 litres of water a
OL,12,Fday, meaning the 6,000-kilogram haul
OL,13,Fcan cumulatively deal with around 66
OL,14,Fmillion litres each week.
OL,16,FThe triploid oysters are sterile and
OL,17,Fdo not reproduce, allowing them to
OL,18,Fgrow faster and filter water all year
OL,19,Fround.
