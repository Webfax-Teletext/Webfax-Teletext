OL,6,FThe women were both known to Mr

OL,8,Fseparately.
OL,10,FHe was described by the prosecution as
OL,11,Fsomeone who could be charming and good
OL,12,Fcompany but was also a "convicted
OL,13,Ffraudster" with an "established
OL,14,Fhistory of violence against women".
OL,16,FReferring to the rape charge, the
OL,17,Fprosecution said that Mr Roberts "took
OL,18,Ffull advantage of her and used her for
OL,19,Fhis own sexual gratification".

OL,6,FThe defence argued the women were
OL,7,Feither lying or inconsistent in their
OL,8,Fstories.
OL,10,FThe court heard Mr Roberts turned to
OL,11,Fdrink to cope with the pressures of
OL,12,Frunning a business as the then-owner
OL,13,Fof Shinzo restaurant in St Aubin.
OL,15,FThe prosecution described how on two

OL,17,Fwith a woman he knew and grabbed her
OL,18,Fby the throat, amounting to common
OL,19,Fassault.
