OL,6,FDeputy Coles' proposals would have
OL,7,Fdecriminalised the personal possession
OL,8,Fand recreational use of cannabis "in
OL,9,Fprinciple" and paved the way for
OL,10,FJersey to become the first place in

OL,11,FDecriminalising cannabis for personal

OL,14,FIt means that people found with small
