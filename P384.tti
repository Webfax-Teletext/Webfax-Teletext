OL,6,Ffarmers are calling on the island's
OL,7,Fgovernment to allow them to control
OL,8,Fthe island's dairy and decide its
OL,9,Ffuture.
OL,11,FThere are 11 farmers on Guernsey who
OL,12,Flook after 20% of the island's land
OL,13,Fand they want to echo in running the
OL,14,Fdairy themselves.
OL,16,FThe President of Guernsey Farmers
OL,17,FAssociation, Michael Bray, says: "Why
OL,18,Fis the States of Guernsey running a
OL,19,Fdairy when they don't know anything
OL,20,Fabout dairy farming or dairying?

OL,6,F"No one else seems to do it in any

OL,10,FA major issue in Guernsey Dairy's

OL,13,FIt says it will need more than #6.25
OL,14,Fmillion to continue operating for the
OL,15,Fnext five years.
OL,17,FThe money would be used to fund the

OL,20,Fpurpose" by the States in 2020.

OL,12,F"In most parts of Europe, farms are

OL,14,Fhappens in Guernsey too, but farmers
OL,15,Fget #1 million a year direct from the

OL,19,Fthat's a lot of money that they aren't

OL,6,F"We believe that we could knock a

OL,14,F"The new dairy has to come fairly soon
OL,15,Fbecause the current one is well past
OL,16,Fits shelf life and we're having to
OL,17,Fpump quite a lot of capital money into
OL,18,Fnew equipment inside the old dairy,
