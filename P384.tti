OL,6,FJersey's new Environment Minister says
OL,7,Fhe "is a little bit more ambivalent"
OL,8,Fabout for an offshore wind farm.
OL,10,FDeputy Steve Luce told ITV News: "My
OL,11,Fpredecessor was very keen. I'm a
OL,12,Flittle bit more ambivalent.
OL,14,F"There are a lot of big questions to
OL,15,Fanswer, but we are doing the work, we
OL,16,Fare speaking to the people who know,
OL,17,Fand I'm hopeful that when we come to
OL,18,Fthe States Assembly in a couple of
OL,19,Fmonths time, we will have a lot of
OL,20,Fquestions answered and States Members
OL,21,Fwill be able to make their mind up.

OL,6,FHe said: "This is not a new idea, but
OL,7,Fwe believe now is the time for Jersey

OL,13,F"The demand for clean energy is huge
