OL,7,FApril has kicked off on a sunny and
OL,8,Fdry note - but what weather can we
OL,9,Fusually expect at this time of year?
OL,11,FRead on for the answer to all of your
OL,12,Fmeteorological musings.
OL,14,FDo April showers bring forth May
OL,15,Fflowers?
OL,17,F'April showers' might be at the
OL,18,Fforefront of our minds, but it is
OL,19,Factually one of our drier months of
OL,20,Fthe year.

OL,12,Fwith easterly winds, inhibiting plant

OL,15,FOne possible explanation behind the
