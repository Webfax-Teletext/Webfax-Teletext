OL,6,FThis comes less than a month after the
OL,7,FBailiwick gave permission to Aurigny,
OL,8,FGuernsey's States-owned airline, to
OL,9,Ffly between the Channel Islands.
OL,11,FThe decision means that Aurigny will
OL,12,Feffectively have a monopoly on flights

OL,15,FIn a statement, the airline also
OL,16,Fappeared to have a dig at Aurigny,
OL,17,Fsaying: "Loganair is a family-owned,
OL,18,Fprofitable, debt-free regional
OL,19,Fairline... we do not rely on taxpayer
OL,20,Ffunding to provide these services."
