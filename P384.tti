OL,6,FAndy Farmer, who organised the beach
OL,7,Fclean, told ITV News: "Probably 90% of
OL,8,Fwhat we find is discarded fishing gear
OL,9,Funfortunately. Bits of nets and
OL,10,Flobster pots, that sort of thing. A
OL,11,Flot of stuff from the oyster fisheries
OL,12,Fhere as well, that we find washed up."
OL,14,FAndy added that it was encouraging to
OL,15,Fsee parents bringing their young kids
OL,16,Falong to help tidy up the beach.
