OL,9,Fresidents with incurable conditions.
OL,11,FThey would all potentially be eligible
OL,12,Funder the proposed law to end their
OL,13,Flives but each has a different view
OL,14,Fabout whether that is a choice they
OL,15,Fwant.

OL,6,FLynne Cottignies is lying on a hospice
OL,7,Fbed.
OL,9,FHer stage four breast cancer is now
OL,10,Funtreatable and the end is near.
OL,12,FShe wanted to end her life when she
OL,13,Fchose, through an assisted death.
OL,15,F"It's just ridiculous that you don't
OL,16,Fhave the choice," she told me.
OL,18,FThree days later, Lynne died in that
OL,19,Fsame bed - just a week before Jersey
OL,20,Fpoliticians would debate whether to
OL,21,Fsupport her cause.

OL,9,FThe sun shone on her and her family as
OL,10,Fwe talked about assisted dying.
OL,12,F"At least that way you could arrange
OL,13,Fit, you could have a definite date,
OL,14,Fyou could make sure that the people
OL,15,Fyou want there are with you", she
OL,16,Fsaid, taking a moment to clear a tear

OL,19,F"That's all I'm asking really, for my
OL,20,Ffamily to be there with me."
