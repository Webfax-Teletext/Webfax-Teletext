OL,6,FAlthough it is not known exactly where

OL,8,Fto have drained into the reservoir in

OL,12,FGuernsey Water says that while there
OL,13,Fis no threat to islanders' health as
OL,14,Fthe polluted water has been contained,
OL,15,Fthey are concerned about the wider
OL,16,Fsupply given that water from Longue
OL,17,FHougue is now only being used in

OL,20,FAny shortage could be compounded by

OL,6,F"This situation offers a very real
OL,7,Fpicture of the importance of using
OL,8,Fpesticides responsibly. Longue Hougue
OL,9,FReservoir holds a total of around
OL,10,F1,165 million litres of water when
OL,11,Ffull, and the level of metamitron that
OL,12,Fhas resulted in the reservoir being
OL,13,Fseverely restricted for use is
OL,14,Fequivalent to around half a litre."
OL,16,FAlongside the ban on metamitron, the
OL,17,Futility company is asking islanders
OL,18,Fusing any other pesticides to stop
OL,19,Fspraying them if rain is forecast and
OL,20,Fto avoid using them near streams, hard
OL,21,Fsurfaces or near drains.
