OL,6,FI said on News at Ten, it was
OL,7,Fextraordinary that after the
OL,8,Fgovernment learned of the egregious
OL,9,FAfghan data leak, no official or
OL,10,Fminister resigned.
OL,12,FI have now learned that on August 23
OL,13,F2023, at the first meeting of the
OL,14,Fgovernment's emergency Cobra meeting
OL,15,Fto discuss the security disaster, the
OL,16,Fthen foreign office minister
OL,17,Fresponsible for the Indo-Pacific, Anne-
OL,18,FMarie Trevelyan, said to the MoD's
OL,19,Frepresentative on the committee,
OL,20,FGeneral Sir Gwyn Jenkins, that
OL,21,Fobviously he would be resigning.
