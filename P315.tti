OL,10,Fsocial media posts and convey our most

OL,13,FThere are now 3,782 emojis in use,
OL,14,Fincluding flags, animals, and food
OL,15,Fitems. That number will soon became
OL,16,F3,790 - as eight new tiny icons are

OL,7,FEmojis have come a long way since the
OL,8,Fconcept was first developed 25 years
OL,9,Fago - and it's become easier than ever
OL,10,Fto express if we feel ,  or  with
OL,11,Fjust a single character on our
OL,12,Fkeyboards.
OL,14,FWe've even seen them used by
OL,15,Fgovernment, and religious leaders,
OL,16,Fwith David Cameron's appointment as
OL,17,Fforeign secretary being announced with

OL,11,FWhat are they?
OL,13,FThe word emoji comes from the Japanese
OL,14,F ("e," picture),  ("mo," write) and
OL,15,F ("ji," character).
OL,17,FThey're small images that can be
OL,18,Finserted into text to convey emotions,
OL,19,Fobjects and ideas.

OL,7,FThe history of using icons to express
OL,8,Femotions online goes back to 1982,
OL,9,Fwhen American computer science
OL,10,Fprofessor Scott Fahlman posted a

OL,12,Fparenthesis on his university bulletin
OL,13,Fboard:
OL,15,FJapanese mobile phone company NTT
OL,16,FDocomo included a small black heart on
OL,17,Fpagers in the mid 1990s, and later
OL,18,Freleased a set of 176 emojis in 1999.
