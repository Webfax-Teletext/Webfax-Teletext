OL,3,CWhy does Syria have a 'new' flag and

OL,6,FSince the country became independent
OL,7,Ffrom the Ottoman Empire in 1918, there
OL,8,Fhave been nine different versions of
OL,9,Fthe national flag. The colours -
OL,10,Fwhite, green, red and black - are one
OL,11,Faspect that has stayed consistent.
OL,13,FThe design brought in by the rebels
OL,14,Fthis week was first developed in the
OL,15,F1930s, during the French mandate. It
OL,16,Fwas used by Syrian revolutionaries,
OL,17,Fand symbolised the desire for
OL,18,Findependence.
OL,20,FIt later became the national flag when
OL,21,FSyria became independent in 1946.

OL,6,FThe four colours have historical
OL,7,FIslamic significance. White represents
OL,8,Fthe Umayyad empire and red symbolises
OL,9,Fan Islamic movement known as Khawarij.
OL,11,FBlack is believed to represent the
OL,12,FProphet Muhammed while the caliph Ali,
OL,13,Fhis cousin, is depicted by the colour
OL,14,Fgreen.
OL,16,FHowever, the colours came to mean
