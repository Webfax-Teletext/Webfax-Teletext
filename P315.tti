OL,6,FFarage and Reform represent such an
OL,7,Fintriguing, important and unusual
OL,8,Fphenomenon in the history of British
OL,9,Fpolitics because, from a position to
OL,10,Fthe right of the Conservative Party,
OL,11,Fthey are harming the Tories and Labour.
OL,13,FSuch is the message of Reform winning
OL,14,Fthe parliamentary by-election in
OL,15,FRuncorn - where less than a year ago,
OL,16,FLabour took what looked an
OL,17,Funassailable 53% of the vote - and
