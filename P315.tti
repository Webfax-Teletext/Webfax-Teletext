OL,6,FOn Tuesday, Angela Rayner and Liz

OL,11,FIn the end - and at the last moment -
OL,12,Fthe government announced that there

OL,6,FEven so, a staggering 49 Labour MPs
OL,7,Fvoted against it, presumably because
OL,8,Fthey simply don't trust Starmer and
OL,9,FReeves.
OL,11,FAnd poor Rachel Reeves in her autumn

OL,13,Fthe #5bn she lost with this radical
