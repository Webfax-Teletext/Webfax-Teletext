OL,6,FReform UK has insisted there is no

OL,8,Fahead of the next general election.
OL,10,FMP Lee Anderson told ITV News his
OL,11,Fparty is "absolutely not" considering
OL,12,Fthe move, after the Financial Times
OL,13,Freported that Nigel Farage told Reform
OL,14,Fdonors he expects a deal to ensure his
OL,15,Fparty sweeps to power.
OL,17,FThe Tories have also denied the
OL,18,Freport, accusing Reform of wanting to
OL,19,F"cosy up to Russian President Vladimir
