OL,6,FThe Australian government says the
OL,7,Fdecision to include YouTube in the age
OL,8,Frestrictions was influenced by a
OL,9,Fsurvey released by Australia's
OL,10,Findependent online regulator, the e-
OL,11,Fsafety Commission.
OL,13,FThe regulator found that 37% of
OL,14,Fchildren surveyed reported seeing
OL,15,Fharmful content on the website.
OL,17,FUnder the new law, children under the
OL,18,Fage of 16 will be banned from holding
OL,19,Faccounts on social media sites, which
OL,20,Falso includes Instagram, Facebook,
OL,21,FTikTok, Snapchat, and X.
