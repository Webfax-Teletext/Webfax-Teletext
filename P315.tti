OL,5,FWith only hours remaining before
OL,6,Ffebrile financial markets awaken again
OL,7,Fin Tokyo, it's clear that the next 48
OL,8,Fhours will be critical in deciding
OL,9,Fwhether the US can avoid a recession
OL,10,Fand the world a painful growth
OL,11,Fdeceleration.
OL,13,FBecause Trump and his record-breaking
OL,14,Ftariffs - and China's tit-for-tat
OL,15,Fretaliation - have forced a triple
OL,16,Fwhammy on the US.
OL,18,FHit number one is the tariffs
OL,19,Fthemselves, which put up the costs of
OL,20,Fgoods and foods, and crush the income
OL,21,Fof consumers and businesses.

OL,3,CWhy recession is now 'the base case'
OL,5,FHit number two is the uncertainty
OL,6,Faround which tariffs are negotiable
OL,7,Fand which are set in stone.
OL,9,FThe uncertainty makes it very
OL,10,Fdifficult for consumers and businesses
OL,11,Fto make big purchases and big
OL,12,Finvestment - because they can't know
OL,13,Fif the items will be a fifth cheaper
OL,14,Fagain in just a few weeks, or where in

OL,16,Fmore resilient or less resilient.
