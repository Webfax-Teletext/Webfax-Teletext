OL,7,FSaudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince -
OL,8,Fwho is also the country's de facto

OL,10,FHouse.
OL,12,FHe was received with all the pageantry
OL,13,Fof a state visit.
OL,15,FThere were military officers on
OL,16,Fhorseback, riding with the US and
OL,17,FSaudi flags, a band on the South Lawn
OL,18,Fof the White House, a flyover, and a
OL,19,Fwarm embrace from President Trump.
