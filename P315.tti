OL,6,FIn the video, Mr Banks said: "I know
OL,7,Fyou're a criminal, but maybe just do
OL,8,Fsomething nice because it's Christmas
OL,9,Fand maybe we can feed a few thousand
OL,10,Fpeople with these pies that you've
OL,11,Fstolen, do the right thing."
OL,13,FHe also urged anyone who is offered
OL,14,Fpies from someone who is not him to
OL,15,Freport them to the police.
OL,17,FMr Banks added: "I'm guessing the
OL,18,Fthieves didn't realise they were
OL,19,Fstealing 2,500 pies along with the
OL,20,Fvan! The pies are all in boxes with my
OL,21,Fname on so not very easy to sell.
