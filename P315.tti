OL,7,F11th month, with tens of thousands of
OL,8,Fpeople dead. International efforts to
OL,9,Fmediate a cease-fire between Israel
OL,10,Fand Hamas have repeatedly stalled as
OL,11,Fthey accuse each other of making
OL,12,Fadditional and unacceptable demands.
OL,14,FThe West Bank also has seen a surge in

OL,17,Fworking to dismantle militant groups
OL,18,Fand prevent increasing militant
