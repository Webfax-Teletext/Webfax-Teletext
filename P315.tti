OL,7,FPresident Donald Trump has sparked
OL,8,Ffears of a global trade war after the
OL,9,FUS president signed an order to put
OL,10,F"reciprocal tariffs" in place, which
OL,11,Fthreatens to impose tariffs as a
OL,12,Fretaliation for charging VAT on US
OL,13,Fgoods.
OL,15,F"They charge us a tax or tariff and we
OL,16,Fcharge them the exact same," Trump
OL,17,Ftold reporters on Thursday in the Oval
OL,18,FOffice before signing the "Fair and

OL,10,FThe White House has argued that
OL,11,Fcharging the same import taxes as
