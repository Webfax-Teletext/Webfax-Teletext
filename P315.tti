OL,5,FThe post-Second World War settlement -
OL,6,Flaws and institutions that constrain
OL,7,Frogue states and remove barriers to
OL,8,Ftrade - has disproportionately
OL,9,Fbenefited the rich countries of the
OL,10,Fwest, Japan and China.
OL,12,FBut it underpinned the most sustained
OL,13,Fperiod of peace and rising prosperity
OL,14,Fin recorded history.
OL,16,FSo, it is both shocking and
OL,17,Fextraordinary that in just the past
OL,18,Ffew days, the president of the country
OL,19,Fthat has benefited most, the US, has
OL,20,Fshredded that settlement.

OL,5,FHis assault on free trade with his

OL,8,Fown country.
OL,10,FThe whole world will also be poorer.
OL,12,FHowever, it is his decision to suspend

OL,7,FThe only explanation is that he sees
OL,8,Fhimself as the modern global
OL,9,Fequivalent of a feudal Lord, even
OL,10,Fperhaps a character in a real-life

OL,3,CIs Trump the shock that Europe needs?
OL,5,FSo the big question for Starmer,
OL,6,FMacron, and Germany's soon-to-be
OL,7,Fchancellor Merz, plus the other
OL,8,Fleaders of Europe, is whether they can
OL,9,Fcollectively take our fate back into
OL,10,Four own hands, by simultaneously
OL,11,Fexpanding our militaries and our
OL,12,Fdefence industries, while belatedly
OL,13,Fand radically re-engineering our
OL,14,Fstagnant economies.
OL,16,FThere are already important signs they
