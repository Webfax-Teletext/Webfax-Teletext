OL,6,FCardinals are gathered in Rome to form
OL,7,Fa conclave and vote for the next pope.
OL,9,FFor centuries, Conclave, meaning "with
OL,10,Fkey" in Latin, has seen cardinals
OL,11,Flocked away until they agree on a new
OL,12,Fpope, ensuring the process is shrouded
OL,13,Fin secrecy and hidden from public view.
OL,15,FSo, how will people know when a new
OL,16,Fpope has been chosen?
OL,18,FFor those outside the chapel, the only
OL,19,Fsign comes from the smoke produced by
OL,20,Fburning the ballots on the chapel's
OL,21,Froof after each round of voting.

OL,6,FThe colour of the smoke tells the
