OL,10,Fyear will be visible in the sky,
OL,11,Fproviding a rare chance to see the

OL,11,FA supermoon occurs when a full lunar

OL,6,FA blue moon is the term used to

OL,9,F29.5 days - marginally shorter than a

OL,11,Fresults in a second full moon in a one-

OL,6,FA supermoon is usually visible three
