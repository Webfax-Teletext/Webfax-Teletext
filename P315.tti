OL,5,FShe said: "This to me is just another
OL,6,Fstep in that journey that finally we
OL,7,Fare creating a world that is made for
OL,8,Fblind young people to thrive, and if
OL,9,FBarbie can be blind that means I can
OL,10,Fbe blind and that is so important for
OL,11,Fthe confidence of young people today."
OL,13,FMs Edwards, who lost sight in her
OL,14,Fright eye at 11 before losing her
OL,15,Fremaining sight at 17, said it is
OL,16,F"incredible" that a blind Barbie has
OL,17,Fbeen created.

OL,5,FShe added: "I didn't see myself
OL,6,Frepresented so that means I was scared
OL,7,Fof blindness. If I had a
OL,8,Frepresentation that said blindness is
OL,9,Fsassy, blindness is cool, blindness is
OL,10,FOK, then I would have been more OK
OL,11,Fwith losing my vision, but it was
OL,12,Fscary."
OL,14,FMattel consulted a number of charities

OL,5,FDebbie Miller, from the RNIB, said it
OL,6,Fis important that people with sight
OL,7,Fproblems were involved with the
OL,8,Fdevelopment: "I don't think it is
OL,9,Fpossible to create diverse products
OL,10,Fwithout speaking directly to the
OL,11,Fpeople that are affected with those
OL,12,Fthings every single day, so it is so
OL,13,Fimportant.
OL,15,F"It seems really simple but big Velcro
OL,16,Ffastenings on the backs of clothing
OL,17,Fjust help so much when you have low
OL,18,Fvision or can't see details, and you
OL,19,Fcan only really learn and understand
