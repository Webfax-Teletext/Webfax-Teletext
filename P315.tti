OL,9,FThe government announced what it calls
OL,10,Fthe "biggest shake-up" in the history
OL,11,Fof the police service on Monday.
OL,13,FThe reforms - which are being billed
OL,14,Fas the most significant in two
OL,15,Fcenturies - were set out by Home
OL,16,FSecretary Shabana Mahmood in a
OL,17,Fstatement to the Commons on Monday
OL,18,Fafternoon.
OL,20,FBut what are the plans, and how will
OL,21,Fthey impact you? ITV News explains.

OL,6,FWhat changes are being announced?JThe
OL,7,Fhome secretary has promised a "new
OL,8,Fmodel of policing", radically shifting
OL,9,Fthe way police forces work in the
OL,10,Fcountry.
OL,12,FThe white paper will slash the number
OL,13,Fof police forces across the UK, and
OL,14,Fintroduce a new National Police
OL,15,FService (NPS) to tackle major crimes.
OL,17,FMahmood compared the NPS to a "British
OL,18,FFBI", aimed at tackling cross-regional
OL,19,Fand international crime. Existing
OL,20,Fpolice forces would focus more on
OL,21,Flocal crime.
