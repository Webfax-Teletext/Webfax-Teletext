OL,3,CWhat Sue Gray's exit says about Starmer
OL,5,FI've said it before and I'll say it
OL,6,Fagain: Keir Starmer's ruthlessness and
OL,7,Funsentimentality is like nothing I've
OL,8,Fencountered in decades of reporting on
OL,9,Fthe brutal world of British politics.
OL,11,FIt was transparently obvious that the
OL,12,Fcentre of his government had been
OL,13,Fdysfunctional since the general
OL,14,Felection on July 4.
OL,16,FBut to replace a chief of staff, Sue
OL,17,FGray, who endured considerable
OL,18,Fopprobrium from former colleagues and
OL,19,Fthe media for choosing to work for him
OL,20,Fin the first place, and so soon after
OL,21,Fthe election, is quite something.

OL,3,CWhat Sue Gray's exit says about Starmer
OL,5,FThere are a few reasons why Keir
OL,6,FStarmer has replaced her with his
OL,7,Fcampaigning guru Morgan McSweeney.
OL,9,FNone of them is a secret.
OL,11,FHere they are in no particular order,
OL,12,Fthough the first is incomparably the
OL,13,Fmost important: the government lacks
OL,14,Fstrategic direction.
OL,16,FAnswering the question "what is the
OL,17,Fpoint of Starmer's government?" should
OL,18,Fbe fairly easy three months after
OL,19,FLabour won its huge Commons majority.

OL,8,Freceiving #1000 Sandro suits as

OL,11,FIn other words, there is an

OL,14,Fwhose expertise is politics and policy
