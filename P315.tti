OL,11,FThe Mont St Michel ferry makes the
OL,12,Fsame crossing every day. But today's
OL,13,Fjourney - from Portsmouth to Normandy
OL,14,Fin France - was a hugely symbolic one.
OL,16,FOn board were more than 30 veterans
OL,17,Fwho made the very same voyage on D-
OL,18,FDay, 80 years ago.

OL,6,FIt was a moment that changed not just

OL,8,FSecond World War.
OL,10,FWhen they set sail on June 6, 1944,
OL,11,Fthey had no idea if they'd ever see
OL,12,Fhome again.
OL,14,FToday, they were given a heroes send

OL,17,Froared overhead.

OL,6,FSitting on deck, 98-year-old Henry
OL,7,FRice told me what he remembered of his
OL,8,Fjourney to Normandy at the age of 18:
OL,9,F"I was 50% excited, 50% apprehensive."
OL,11,FHis job was to take out supplies and
OL,12,Fbring back the wounded.
OL,14,F"I was half expecting shells and
OL,15,Fbullets and U-boats ... but I got away
OL,16,Fwith it," Mr Rice said.
OL,18,F"It's the thought of those lads that
OL,19,Fare still lying over there, those that
OL,20,Fgave their lives. I survived and they
OL,21,Fdidn't. That's what I'm doing this for.

OL,9,FThousands of allied troops were killed
OL,10,Fon D Day alone, as they fought their
OL,11,Fway onto Normandy's beaches.
OL,13,FIt was the biggest seaborne invasion
OL,14,Fin history and, ultimately, a moment
OL,15,Fthat helped to turn the tide against
OL,16,Ftheir enemy.
OL,18,FAlec Penstone, 99, remembers it like
OL,19,Fit was yesterday.

OL,7,Fsubmarine detector, was to stop German
OL,8,FU-boats from attacking Allied boats as
OL,9,Fthey made their way towards Normandy.
OL,11,F"And we managed it!" he exclaimed.
OL,13,FI asked him if he was proud of what he
OL,14,Fachieved that day, to which he
OL,15,Fresponded: "Yes, definitely. Without a
