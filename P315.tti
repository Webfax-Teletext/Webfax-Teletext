OL,6,FQuite often we see former hurricanes

OL,8,Ftravel from the US or Caribbean,
OL,9,Facross the Atlantic, resulting in
OL,10,Fheavy rain and strong, damaging winds
OL,11,F- or we see deep areas of low pressure
OL,12,Fform in the mid-Atlantic and bring
OL,13,Fstormy conditions to our shores.
OL,15,FIn this scenario, we're seeing a
OL,16,Fcombination of the two - which is a
OL,17,Flittle more rare.
