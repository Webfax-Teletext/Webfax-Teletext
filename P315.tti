OL,4,Cmatters to us
OL,6,FOne of Donald Trump's most significant
OL,7,Fachievements in his first 100 days is
OL,8,Fsecuring the election of arguably his
OL,9,Fmost trenchant critic, Mark Carney, as
OL,10,Fthe Prime Minister of Canada.
OL,12,FIndeed, it might just turn out to be
OL,13,Fthe most significant consequence of
OL,14,Fhis tenure, as I will explain.
OL,16,FBefore his inauguration, there was
OL,17,Fzero prospect of Carney's Liberal
OL,18,FParty escaping electoral humiliation
OL,19,For of the former Bank of England
OL,20,Fgovernor being picked to lead the
OL,21,Fparty.

OL,6,FThe Conservatives, led by someone who
OL,7,Fappeared to be a student of Trump's
OL,8,Fplaybook and rhetoric, Pierre
OL,9,FPolievre, were a shoo-in.
OL,11,FBut after Trump launched a tariff war
