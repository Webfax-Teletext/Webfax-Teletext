OL,8,Fstruck the Swiss alpine village of
OL,9,FBlatten on May 28. In the middle of
OL,10,Fthe afternoon a glacier that had stood
OL,11,Fabove the village for centuries broke
OL,12,Ffree from the mountainside and crashed
OL,13,Fdown onto Blatten.
OL,15,FThe Swiss authorities had seen in
OL,16,Fcoming and evacuated the inhabitants
OL,17,F10 days earlier ` only one person is
OL,18,Fmissing, which is both miraculous and
OL,19,Fa tribute to Swiss engineering. But
OL,20,Fthe 300 people who lived there lost
OL,21,Feverything.
