OL,6,FUS President Donald Trump has said he
OL,7,Fwill file his lawsuit against the BBC
OL,8,Fby Tuesday morning after an episode of
OL,9,FPanorama selectively edited one of his
OL,10,Fspeeches.
OL,12,FThe scandal unfolded earlier this year
OL,13,Fafter a leaked memo highlighted
OL,14,Fconcerns about the way clips of Mr
OL,15,FTrump's speech on January 6 2021, were
OL,16,Fspliced together so it appeared he had
OL,17,Ftold supporters he was going to walk
OL,18,Fto the US Capitol with them to "fight
OL,19,Flike hell".
