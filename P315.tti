OL,12,F"That jury was picked so fast - 95%

OL,6,FMr Merchan previously found Trump in
OL,7,Fcontempt of court for nine previous
OL,8,Fviolations, fining him the maximum
OL,9,Fallowed by law, $1,000 per instance,
OL,10,For $9,000. On Monday, Merchan
OL,11,Fthreatened to jail Trump if another
OL,12,Fviolation occurs.
OL,14,F"It appears, for the tenth time, that
OL,15,Fthe $1,000 fines are not serving as a
OL,16,Fdeterrent.
OL,18,FTherefore, going forward this court
OL,19,Fwill have to consider a jail
OL,20,Fsanction," Mr Merchan announced.
