OL,3,CDirector of Public Prosecutions tells
OL,4,CMPs why he dropped China spy case
OL,6,FI am told that the Director of Public
OL,7,FProsecutions has just told some of
OL,8,Fparliament's most senior MPs - chairs
OL,9,Fof home, justice, foreign and security
OL,10,Fcommittees - that the evidence
OL,11,Fprovided by the government's witness
OL,12,Fin the China spy case was "5% less
OL,13,Fthan the evidence threshold that was
OL,14,Fneeded".
OL,16,FStephen Parkinson told the MPs that
OL,17,Fthe witness, Deputy National Security
OL,18,FAdviser Matthew Collins, had made it
OL,19,Fclear to the Crown Prosecution Service
OL,20,Fhe was not going to provide the
OL,21,Fadditional 5%.

OL,3,CDirector of Public Prosecutions tells
OL,4,CMPs why he dropped China spy case
OL,6,FWhich is why Parkinson canned the case.
OL,8,FAnd as I said earlier, he informed the
OL,9,FAttorney General Hermer of his
OL,10,Fdecision to kibosh the prosecution.
OL,12,FThe MPs were surprised by what
OL,13,FParkinson told them, to put it mildly.
OL,15,FThey asked why Parkinson did not get a
OL,16,Fsecond expert witness, to fill in the
OL,17,Fsmall gap left by Collins.
OL,19,FThe DPP in essence said that is not
OL,20,Fthe way the CPS operates.

OL,6,FHe was also pressed by the MPs about
OL,7,Fwhy he would not take the risk of
OL,8,Fputting the case to a jury.
OL,10,FHe claimed he did not believe a judge
OL,11,Fwould let it get that far.
OL,13,FThe MPs were not convinced.
OL,15,FOne said: "He was just a bit wet about
OL,16,Fthe whole thing. He should have taken
OL,17,Fthe risk of prosecuting and have let a
OL,18,Fjury decide."
