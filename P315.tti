OL,6,FAmazon suggests the problem isn't with
OL,7,Fthe database itself, but rather that
OL,8,Fsomething went wrong with the records
OL,9,Fthat tell other systems where to find
OL,10,Ftheir data.
OL,12,FBecause so many sites and services use
OL,13,FAWS, a DNS (Domain Name System) error
OL,14,Fcan have widespread results.
OL,16,FProfessor Oli Buckley, an expert in
