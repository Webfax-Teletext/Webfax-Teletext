OL,6,FMeta said on Friday that it will push
OL,7,Fahead with controversial plans to use
OL,8,Fmillions of UK Facebook and Instagram
OL,9,Fposts to train its artificial
OL,10,Fintelligence (AI) technology.
OL,12,FStarting from next week, Mark
OL,13,FZuckerberg's company said it will use
OL,14,Fpublic posts, including photos,
OL,15,Fcaptions and comments, to build its
OL,16,Fgenerative AI to "reflect British
OL,17,Fculture, history and idiom."
OL,19,FThe content will not include private
OL,20,Fmessages or information from accounts
OL,21,Fof users under the age of 18, it added.
