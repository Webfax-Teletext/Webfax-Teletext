OL,12,FThis week brings a bit of a breather
OL,13,Fwith cool Atlantic air making things

OL,17,FThere will be passing showers at

OL,3,CWhat is a 'super plume' summer which

OL,6,FSummer temperatures usually rise due
OL,7,Fto day-on-day heating (known as
OL,8,Fhomegrown warmth) as high pressure
OL,9,Ftakes charge.
OL,11,FThis was the case through the middle
OL,12,Fof last week.
OL,14,FWe also see temperatures climb easily
OL,15,Fwhen we draw in hotter, usually humid,
OL,16,Fair from Europe in a southerly airflow.
OL,18,FThis is the scenario we expect by
OL,19,FSunday and Monday, when a plume of hot
OL,20,Fair surges north into the UK and
OL,21,Ftemperatures rise easily and rapidly.

OL,6,FWe last saw this set up in 2022 - the

OL,12,FThe first half of summer 2023 also
OL,13,Ffollowed suit with June of that year
OL,14,Fbeing the hottest June on record - but
OL,15,Ffrom July of that year, the jet stream
OL,16,Fshifted, making for a disappointing
OL,17,Fremainder of the summer. It was
OL,18,Ffollowed by an unseasonable and

OL,20,Fweek of September.
