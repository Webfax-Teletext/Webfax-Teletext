OL,3,CBadenoch: 'Disappointing' it took ITV
OL,4,Cdrama to prioritise Post Office
OL,5,Cpayments
OL,7,FThe Tory leader said Monday that ITV's
OL,8,FPost Office drama "brought the urgency
OL,9,Fand raised the prioritisation" of Post
OL,10,FOffice payouts.
OL,12,FSpeaking at the Horizon IT inquiry,
OL,13,FKemi Badenoch said it is "extremely
OL,14,Fdisappointing" that it took the
OL,15,Fseries, released at the beginning of
OL,16,Fthis year, to change "the priority of
OL,17,Fthe issue".
OL,19,FThe government allowed "bureaucracy to
OL,20,Fget in the way of redress" for wronged
OL,21,Fsubpostmasters, she added.

OL,9,Fmore than 700 subpostmasters falsely
OL,10,Fprosecuted by the Post Office and
OL,11,Fhanded criminal convictions.
OL,13,FSome subpostmasters are still awaiting

OL,7,FExplaining why she felt bureaucracy
OL,8,Fwas getting in the way of redress,
OL,9,FBadenoch told the probe on Monday: "I
OL,10,Ffeel that there is often too much
OL,11,Fbureaucracy in the way of getting
OL,12,Fthings done, because people are
OL,13,Fworried about process.
OL,15,F"They are worried about: if things go
OL,16,Fwrong, they'll be on the hook for that.
OL,18,F"So they carry out lots of checks and
OL,19,Fbalances well beyond what I think is
OL,20,Frequired in order to deliver the right
OL,21,Foutcome."
