OL,14,FThe National Screening Committee,

OL,6,FIt's understood the committee is
OL,7,Fconcerned about high levels of
OL,8,Foverdiagnosis, over-treatment and
OL,9,Ffalse positives which come from PSA
OL,10,Ftesting.
OL,12,FInstead, it is likely to recommend
OL,13,Fthat tests are only offered to men
OL,14,Fwith certain genetic mutations - BRCA-
OL,15,F1 and BRCA-2 - which put them at
OL,16,Fhigher risk of prostate cancer.
OL,18,FMore than 12,000 men die from prostate
OL,19,Fcancer in the UK every year.

OL,6,FIt is estimated that around one in
OL,7,Feight men will be diagnosed with it at
OL,8,Fsome point in their lives. For black
OL,9,Fmen, the risk is double.
OL,11,FThese are all draft recommendations,
OL,12,Fwhich will later go out for

OL,14,Fthe decision of the health secretaries
