OL,7,FSpeaking on Wednesday morning, Rachel
OL,8,FReeves said she thought hard work
OL,9,Fshould pay, but that she was concerned
OL,10,Fabout the number of young people out
OL,11,Fof work.
OL,13,F"We value the fact that wages over the
OL,14,Flast year and a half have risen at a
OL,15,Ffaster rate than prices. And that is
OL,16,Fsomething that didn't happen under the
OL,17,Fprevious Conservative government,
OL,18,Fwhich is what contributed to the
OL,19,Fterrible cost-of-living challenges
OL,20,Fthat people face, " she said.
