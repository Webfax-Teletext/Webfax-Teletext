OL,6,FRishi Sunak wants to make the election
OL,7,Fabout tax, or more precisely that the
OL,8,FTories would cut taxes and Labour
OL,9,Fwould raise them.
OL,11,FThere are a number of challenges for
OL,12,Fhim with this approach, the most
OL,13,Fobvious one being that the Tories in
OL,14,Fgovernment have raised the burden of -
OL,15,Fthe share of national income taken by
OL,16,Fthe Treasury in taxes - to its highest
OL,17,Flevel since the early 1960s.
OL,19,FIn that sense, he and the have a
OL,20,Fcredibility problem.

OL,3,CWhy do voters give no credit to Sunak

OL,6,FThere are a few reasons. First, anyone
OL,7,Fearning less than #32,000 or more than
OL,8,F#55,000 has been a loser. They may not
OL,9,Fbe the average taxpayer but they are

OL,12,Fpaying a lot more tax, and the tax
OL,13,Ftake from VAT has risen considerably).
OL,15,FSecond, and as the IFS also points
OL,16,Fout, the proportion of retired people
OL,17,Fpaying tax is now higher than for
OL,18,Fworking people. This reflects the
