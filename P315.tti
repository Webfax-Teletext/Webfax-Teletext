OL,8,Fas Sir Andy Murray once quipped "with
OL,9,Fmy fingers" - this season is set to be
OL,10,Fone of the sweetest and most shapely
OL,11,Fon record.
OL,13,FThe bumper harvest of strawberries is
OL,14,Fdown to an unusually sunny spring,
OL,15,Fwith the highest levels recorded by
OL,16,Fthe Met Office in more than 100 years,
OL,17,Fpaired with some cooler weather, which
OL,18,Fhas allowed the crop to develop slowly

OL,10,FIt's certainly been an outstanding
OL,11,Fspring so far with 546 hours of
OL,12,Fsunshine recorded across the UK so far
OL,13,F(with nearly two weeks still to go)
OL,14,Fwhich edges us towards the second

OL,6,FThe warm days and cool nights have
OL,7,Fbeen welcomed by strawberry farmers
OL,8,Fwho have also been largely protected
OL,9,Ffrom an extended dry spell by their
OL,10,Firrigation systems.
OL,12,FNot so lucky are the vast majority of
OL,13,Farable farmers for whom the lack of
OL,14,Frain is now a serious concern. It was
OL,15,Fthe driest April on record - and as
OL,16,Fwe've moved into May, large areas of

OL,18,Fall.
