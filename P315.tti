OL,7,Fcalled on the British Medical
OL,8,FAssociation's (BMA) resident doctors
OL,9,Fto abandon their "unreasonable"

OL,11,F"fragile" recovery.
OL,13,FSpeaking in the Commons, Streeting
OL,14,Fsaid: "We have put the NHS on the road
OL,15,Fto recovery, but we all know that the
OL,16,FNHS is still hanging by a thread, and
OL,17,Fthat the BMA is threatening to pull it.
