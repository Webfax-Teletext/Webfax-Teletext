OL,6,FWe are well into Monday in Ukraine and
OL,7,Fthe ceasefire that had been proposed
OL,8,Fhas, unsurprisingly, not materialised.

OL,14,FLots of it is being done in public and

OL,16,Fseems unlikely any of it will generate

OL,20,Fbeing waged for one man in Washington.

OL,6,FBy the early hours of Sunday,
OL,7,FPresident Putin was proposing talks in
OL,8,FTurkey - a smart choice of venue given
OL,9,Fboth nations have warm relations with
OL,10,Fthe Turkish leader.
OL,12,FIt was an apparent attempt to look
OL,13,Fkeen on peace whilst ignoring
OL,14,Fcompletely the calls for a ceasefire -
OL,15,Fa proposal initially put forward by
OL,16,FPresident Trump, and something he
OL,17,Fsupported on Saturday.
OL,19,FOn Sunday, President Zelenskyy says he
OL,20,Fwill take part in the talks proposed
OL,21,Fby President Putin.
