OL,6,FThe mystery about the abolition by
OL,7,FStreeting and Starmer of NHS England
OL,8,Fis not why they are doing it, but that
OL,9,Fthe previous Tory government chose not
OL,10,Fto.
OL,12,FBecause the health secretary's
OL,13,Frationale is that so much of what NHS
OL,14,FEngland does is expensively duplicated
OL,15,Fin his Department for Health and
OL,16,FSocial Care. To put it in the simplest
OL,17,Fterms, when he wants official advice
OL,18,Fon some element of NHS management or
OL,19,Fpolicy, he'd rather hear one coherent
OL,20,Fvoice rather than two competing ones.

OL,6,FAnd given that the previous Tory
OL,7,Fadministration banged on about wanting
OL,8,Fto abolish fat and waste in the public
OL,9,Fsector, NHS England therefore looks a
OL,10,Frational place to start.
OL,12,FPossibly Johnson, Truss and Sunak were
OL,13,Fscared of being accused of squeezing
OL,14,Fthe country's beloved health service,
OL,15,Fagainst a background of their party
OL,16,Fnot being widely trusted on its
OL,17,Fstewardship of it. But sacking
OL,18,F"managers" - as opposed to nurses and
OL,19,Fdoctors - is rarely unpopular.
