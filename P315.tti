OL,5,FEnergy bills jumped by 10% last month
OL,6,F- with the average household spending
OL,7,F#1717 a year on their energy bills.
OL,9,FThis is expected to increase by a
OL,10,Ffurther 3% in the first half of 2025
OL,11,Fwhen the new price cap is announced by
OL,12,FOfgem this Friday.
OL,14,FWith energy prices set to rise again
OL,15,Fthis winter, what changes can we make
OL,16,Fto reduce our energy bill?
OL,18,FThe Booth family, from Manchester, are
OL,19,Fpaying #252 a month on their energy
OL,20,Fbills - that's over 50% more than the
OL,21,Faverage household.

OL,6,FCEO of The Energy Shop, to see if he
OL,7,Fcould make some quick changes to help
OL,8,Fout the family-of-four.
OL,10,FLike many people during the 2021
OL,11,Fenergy crisis, Marcel and his wife

OL,16,FAlmost two years after the start of

OL,19,Fdidn't choose, including the Booths.

OL,6,Fhungry to acquire new customers. As a
OL,7,Fresult, they've got cheaper tariffs
OL,8,Fthat people can switch to and save
OL,9,Fmoney. It would take about three weeks
OL,10,Ffor you to switch. It can now be done
OL,11,Fin five days."
OL,13,FBefore Scott left the Booths, he also
OL,14,Fgave them other energy saving tips
OL,15,Fincluding turning the thermostat down
OL,16,Fby one degree, only using their
OL,17,Fdishwasher when it's full, and taking
