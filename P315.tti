OL,8,Fhe failed to introduce an early
OL,9,Fprisoner release scheme (like the one
OL,10,Fthat has been brought in today by
OL,11,FLabour) they might need to "get down

OL,6,FSources have suggested that Downing
OL,7,FStreet later indicated to the MoJ that
OL,8,Fthey were willing to go ahead with the
OL,9,Fso-called SDS-40 scheme, in which
OL,10,Fprisoners on particular sentences are
OL,11,Freleased early, 40% of the way through
OL,12,Ftheir sentences rather than 50%.
OL,14,FSo when the election was called on

OL,6,FChalk had warned for some time that
OL,7,Fthe system was reaching tipping point
OL,8,Fbut would then use short term measures
OL,9,Flike ESCL ( End of Custody Supervised
OL,10,FLicence) to ease the pressure.
OL,12,FThat would not require legislation but
OL,13,Fwould mean some prisoners would be
OL,14,Freleased 18 days earlier.
OL,16,FBecause of the success of ESCL there
OL,17,Fwas a sense in Downing Street that the
OL,18,FMoJ was 'crying wolf', according to
OL,19,Fsources, and so they were reluctant to
OL,20,Ftake action as Chalk became more
OL,21,Finsistent.
