OL,7,Fwon't be intimidated by President

OL,9,Fwould be at war with Russia if
OL,10,Fpermission is given to Ukraine to fire

OL,12,FRussian territory.
OL,14,FAsked about Putin's threat, the UK PM
OL,15,Fresponded: "Russia illegally invaded
OL,16,FUkraine. Russia can end this conflict
OL,17,Fstraight away...They started this

OL,19,Fself-defence."

OL,6,FStarmer's language was that of
OL,7,Fstanding up to a bully.
OL,9,FHe signaled however that permission
OL,10,Fwould not be given on Friday, during
OL,11,Fhis White House meeting with President
OL,12,FBiden, for Ukraine to deploy western
OL,13,Fmissiles to knock out air and missile
OL,14,Fbases in Russian territory.
OL,16,FStarmer described such a decision on
OL,17,Fbroadening the licence for the use of
OL,18,FStorm Shadow missiles as a "tactical"
OL,19,Fone, and insisted his discussions with
OL,20,FBiden would be focused wholly on
OL,21,Fstrategy.
