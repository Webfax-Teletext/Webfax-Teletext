OL,8,Farmy career. In 23 years with the
OL,9,FHousehold Cavalry he qualified as a
OL,10,Fparachutist and sniper, fighting in
OL,11,FBosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan,
OL,12,Fwhere his achievements as a marksman
OL,13,Fbecame the subject of newspaper
OL,14,Farticles, podcasts and a book.
OL,16,FBut, alongside the medals and
OL,17,Faccolades, there is a darker legacy of
OL,18,Fhis service; scars to his arms and
OL,19,Fbody, a mental health condition and an
