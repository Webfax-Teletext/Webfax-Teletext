OL,6,FAs the moon passes between us and the
OL,7,Fsun, expect a partial eclipse of the
OL,8,Fsun on Saturday morning.
OL,10,FThis is our first notable eclipse of
OL,11,Fthis size since 2015 in the UK - but
OL,12,Fwe did see a smaller occurrence in
OL,13,F2021.
OL,15,FWhat time will this happen?
OL,17,FIt's expected to be visible between
OL,18,F10am and midday across the UK - when
OL,19,Fthe sun will be at near it's maximum
OL,20,Fheight in the sky this time of year.

OL,10,FIreland will be prone to more cloudy
OL,11,Fovercast skies making it trickier to

OL,14,FElsewhere we'll see a mixture of

OL,6,FIt's important not to look directly at
OL,7,Fthe sun with the naked eye or

OL,10,FHow obvious will it be?
OL,12,FThe sun will be most eclipsed in the
OL,13,Ffar north of Scotland with 50% or so
OL,14,Fobscured by the moon's shadow. Here we
OL,15,Fexpect slightly dulled skies and a
OL,16,Fslight and brief drop in temperature.
OL,18,FFurther south around 30% of the sun
OL,19,Fwill be hidden briefly - expect the
OL,20,Fsame conditions as above but to a
OL,21,Flesser extent.
