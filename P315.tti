OL,8,Fthe country relies heavily. Only a few
OL,9,Fweeks ago, the Royal Navy intercepted

OL,11,Fthe coast of Scotland. It is believed
OL,12,Fto have the ability to sabotage

OL,19,Fprotect the seas around the UK from

OL,7,Fwhere the Helsing gliders come in.
OL,9,FThe gliders themselves are not new

OL,11,Fthat is the key. Helsing has developed
OL,12,Fwhat it calls a large acoustic model,
