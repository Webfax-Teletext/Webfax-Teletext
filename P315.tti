OL,3,CWhat is the latest drought warning and

OL,6,FQuite simply, it means there is a
OL,7,Fshortage of water. This year, it has
OL,8,Fbeen triggered by record-breaking
OL,9,Ftemperatures and an extremely dry
OL,10,Fspring.
OL,12,FThe problem is made worse by a lack of
OL,13,Fstorage (no new reservoirs have been
OL,14,Fbuilt in the past 30 years) and leaks
OL,15,Ffrom pipes.
OL,17,FThe lack of water has led to hosepipe
OL,18,Fbans being introduced in some parts of
OL,19,Fthe country, and farmers are reporting
OL,20,Flow yields from their harvests.
