OL,9,Fthe BBC.
OL,11,FDonald Trump has arrived in Florida
OL,12,Ffor the weekend, still determined to
OL,13,Fpursue legal action against the BBC.
OL,15,FNot only has he declared that the BBC
OL,16,Fapology and retraction are
OL,17,Finsufficient, Trump is now suggesting
OL,18,Fthat he will sue the corporation for
OL,19,Fup to $5 billion - five times his

OL,6,FThe BBC has made clear that it is not
OL,7,Fprepared to pay the president
OL,8,Fcompensation, arguing that it made a
OL,9,Fmistake, but that the Panorama
OL,10,Fdocumentary, which was broadcast just
OL,11,Fdays before the 2024 election, was not
OL,12,Fdefamatory.
OL,14,FTrump issued his renewed legal threats
OL,15,Fin two interviews. The first was to GB
OL,16,FNews in the White House last night. He
OL,17,Finsisted that the BBC editing of the
OL,18,Fdocumentary was so misleading and
OL,19,F"egregious" that he felt an
OL,20,F"obligation" to sue the company.

OL,12,FOne, he told reporters that he would
OL,13,Fsue for between "one to five billion
OL,14,Fdollars" and would likely file the
OL,15,Flawsuit at some point next week.
OL,17,FTrump added that he wants to speak to
OL,18,FKeir Starmer this weekend, who he said
OL,19,Fwas embarrassed by the whole affair,
OL,20,Fand he suggested that UK taxpayers are

OL,6,FThere is no suggestion that the

OL,8,Ffrom their threats. Trump described
OL,9,Fthe BBC News editing of his January 6,
OL,10,F2021, speech as "beyond fake, this is
OL,11,Fcorrupt".
OL,13,FThis piles pressure on BBC executives
