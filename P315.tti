OL,7,FSir Keir Starmer has hailed his

OL,11,Fof "selling fishermen down the river".
OL,13,FThe prime minister told the Commons on
OL,14,FTuesday afternoon that the freshly
OL,15,Fstruck deal is a "signal that Britain
OL,16,Fis back on the world stage" and will
OL,17,Fdrive down bills, drive up jobs, and
OL,18,Fstrengthen the UK's borders.
