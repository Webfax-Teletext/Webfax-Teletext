OL,3,CWhy does the deputy speaker oversee

OL,5,CHoyle?
OL,7,FUp until the 18th century, the
OL,8,Fposition of speaker was a complex one.
OL,9,FThey had to represent the House's
OL,10,Finterests to the King on one hand, and
OL,11,Fthe King's interests to the House on
OL,12,Fthe other - at times putting them at
OL,13,Fodds with both.
OL,15,FIn the late 17th century, the Commons
OL,16,Fdecided that when it came to financial
OL,17,Fdemands from the King, it would need
OL,18,Fto resolve them as a whole house.
