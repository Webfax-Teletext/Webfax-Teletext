OL,9,FIn Antarctica, the climate is changing
OL,10,Fand so is the way scientists work.
OL,12,FIt is a mountainous landscape and also
OL,13,Fone of the coldest, driest places on
OL,14,Fearth.
OL,16,FThe continent is fraught with threats
OL,17,Ffor scientists working on the ice.
OL,19,FHidden under the snow are crevasses -
OL,20,Fdeep holes in the ice which can go
OL,21,Fdown for dozens of metres.

OL,6,FThey are hard to see and if you fall
OL,7,Fin one, it can be deadly.
OL,9,FField guides use specialist equipment
OL,10,Fto scan the ice and identify crevasses.
OL,12,FThey mark them with flags to warn
OL,13,Fscientists where to avoid walking.
OL,15,FAs the climate warms, the ice is
OL,16,Fbecoming less stable.

OL,6,FRainfall, which is becoming more
OL,7,Ffrequent in Antarctica, can flow into
OL,8,Fcracks in the ice. It expands when it
OL,9,Ffreezes making those cracks even
OL,10,Fbigger.
OL,12,FIt means trips by the field guides to
OL,13,Fplot safe passages are needing to take
OL,14,Fplace more frequently.
OL,16,FScientists are also finding routes
OL,17,Fthey used to do on a skidoo are no
OL,18,Flonger strong enough and can only be
OL,19,Fwalked.

OL,6,FOther changes include sea ice becoming
OL,7,Fweaker. After losing equipment as it
OL,8,Ffell through the ice into the sea,
OL,9,Fsome scientists have now taken to
OL,10,Ftying flotation devices onto their
