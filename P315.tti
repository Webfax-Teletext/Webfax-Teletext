OL,6,FThe former boss of Asda and Marks &
OL,7,FSpencer has said remote working has
OL,8,Fcreated a generation who are "not
OL,9,Fdoing proper work".
OL,11,FLord Stuart Rose told BBC One's
OL,12,FPanorama that working from home made
OL,13,Fpeople less productive and led to the
OL,14,F"general decline" of the UK economy.
OL,16,F"We have regressed in this country in
OL,17,Fterms of working practices,
OL,18,Fproductivity and in terms of the
OL,19,Fcountry's wellbeing, I think, by 20
OL,20,Fyears in the last four," he said.
