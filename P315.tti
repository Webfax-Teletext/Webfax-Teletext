OL,15,FThe highly anticipated decision issued

OL,6,F"After having carefully considered and
OL,7,Fweighed the witness testimony and
OL,8,Fevidence, the court reaches the
OL,9,Ffollowing conclusion: Google is a
OL,10,Fmonopolist, and it has acted as one to
OL,11,Fmaintain its monopoly," Mr Mehta wrote
OL,12,Fin his 277-page ruling.
OL,14,FHe said Google's dominance in the
OL,15,Fsearch market is evidence of its
OL,16,Fmonopoly.
OL,18,FGoogle "enjoys an 89.2% share of the
OL,19,Fmarket for general search services,
OL,20,Fwhich increases to 94.9% on mobile
OL,21,Fdevices," the ruling said.

OL,8,Fevery year to install its search
OL,9,Fengine as the default option on new
OL,10,Fmobile phones and tech gadgets.
