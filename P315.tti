OL,10,FThe choice to be made tomorrow in the

OL,15,FThe first would reward work and would

OL,6,FThe second would do the same, but
OL,7,Fwould also hand additional cash to
OL,8,Fcore Tory supporters, namely
OL,9,Fpensioners and those with investment
OL,10,Fincome (from property rentals, share
OL,11,Fdividends, interest in savings and so
OL,12,Fon).
OL,14,FInevitably therefore cutting the rate
OL,15,Fof income tax costs #2bn a year more
OL,16,Fthan cutting NI for each penny
OL,17,Freduction. So bribing more potential

OL,3,CThe chancellor's choice between

OL,6,FMy hunch, as I said , is he'll do a
OL,7,Fpenny off each. But as of now, that is
OL,8,Fhow it smells rather than what I know.
OL,10,FWhat I know is that 2p in the pound is

OL,12,Fsome combination or other.
OL,14,FTorsten Bell from the think tank the

OL,6,FHe compares Mr Hunt's tax policy to
OL,7,Fthat of former Chancellor George
OL,8,FOsborne, saying: "I think everyone who
OL,9,Fworks on tax policy will recognise
OL,10,Fthat Jeremy Hunt's is by far the
OL,11,Fbetter tax reform strategy - whatever
OL,12,Fthey think about whether the tax cuts

OL,14,Fclimate."
OL,16,FUPDATE 1415:
OL,18,FThe Times' Political Editor Steven
OL,19,FSwinford is right that Chancellor will
OL,20,Ftomorrow cut employee national
OL,21,Finsurance by 2p.

OL,6,FThe distributional impact, i.e winners
OL,7,Fand losers, are interesting. According
OL,8,Fto the Resolution Foundation, those
OL,9,Fearning up to #19,000 would be net
OL,10,Flosers because of freezing of
OL,11,Fthresholds.
OL,13,FThose earning just under #50,000 would
OL,14,Fbe biggest winners, with net gain of
OL,15,F#1200.
OL,17,FAbove that threshold the benefits
OL,18,Fshrink in relative terms. And remember
