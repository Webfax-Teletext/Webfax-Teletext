OL,7,Fhave occurred in the region since
OL,8,F2024, according to data from the
OL,9,FNational Oceanic and Atmospheric

OL,6,FSimilarly, in November 2025, the Earth
OL,7,Fexperienced a "cannibal storm" that
OL,8,Fwas also strong enough to pose a
OL,9,Fthreat to satellites and navigation

OL,12,FBut what causes this?
OL,14,FThe aurora borealis occurs due to a
OL,15,Fprocess known as coronal mass ejection
OL,16,F(CME). Particles from the sun erupt
OL,17,Fand combine with the Earth's

OL,11,FThese areas are in the annulus region,

OL,10,FDuring this period, the Sun has the

OL,6,FThere are currently about 120

OL,10,FAt the peak of the Sun cycle in 2024

OL,13,FProfessor Silvia Dalla, Professor of
