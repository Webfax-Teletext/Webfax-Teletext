OL,6,FA dad from Surrey who has undergone a
OL,7,Fpioneering stem cell transplant to try
OL,8,Fhalt the progression of his MS, says
OL,9,Fhe's devastated things have not
OL,10,Fimproved.
OL,12,FMartin Stokes undertook a radical
OL,13,Fprocedure that involved aggressive
OL,14,Fchemotherapy that wiped out his immune
OL,15,Fsystem and required four months in
OL,16,Fisolation - away from his wife and
OL,17,Fyoung daughter.
OL,19,FBut six months after the treatment,
OL,20,FMartin says it has made his symptoms
OL,21,Fworse.

OL,6,FMartin describes the treatment as
OL,7,Fbeing the hardest thing he has ever
OL,8,Fdone, but all seemed to be going well
OL,9,Funtil he left hospital.
OL,11,FHe then suddenly lost the ability to
OL,12,Fwalk and was diagnosed with a viral
OL,13,Finfection. He was rushed back into
OL,14,Fhospital, where treatment got the
OL,15,Fvirus under control, but it's had a
OL,16,Fhuge impact on his health.
OL,18,FMartin says: "Everything is worse.
OL,19,FWalking is so much harder. Ears, eyes,
OL,20,Fmotor skills, cognitive ability, that
OL,21,Fhas all suddenly tumbled down."

OL,6,F"I just struggle to do everyday things

OL,8,Falso lost a lot of dexterity in my

OL,12,FThe treatment is known to have a lot
OL,13,Fof side effects but the severity of
OL,14,Fthe decline was not something Martin
OL,15,Fexpected and he's struggling to cope
OL,16,Fwith his new reality.
OL,18,FThe only hope is that although his

OL,20,Fstill halt the progression of the MS,
OL,21,Fbut that is very uncertain.
