OL,6,FThe Prime Minister also joked about
OL,7,Fhaving "seen enough Snickers bars for
OL,8,Fa while" having been surrounded by
OL,9,Fconfectionary at the warehouse.
OL,11,FResponding to the West Ham fan, he
OL,12,Fsaid: "We're not having a brilliant
OL,13,Fend to the season, but fundamentally
OL,14,Fif you told me at the start of the
OL,15,Fseason we'd be in the play-offs, I
OL,16,Fwould have said 'great, I'll take it.'
OL,18,F"So hopefully play-off finals and
OL,19,FWembley... anything can happen but I
OL,20,Ffeel good about it.
