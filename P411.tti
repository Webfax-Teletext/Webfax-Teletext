OL,6,FThe Environment Agency said planning
OL,7,Fwork has begun to clear the huge
OL,8,Fillegal waste mountain in Kidlington.
OL,10,FThe body had previously suggested that
OL,11,Fthose responsible for dumping the
OL,12,Fwaste should cover the cost of the
OL,13,Fclean-up but it says that although
OL,14,Fthey still believe in that principle,
OL,15,Fit has now taken the 'exceptional'
OL,16,Fdecision to start planning for the
OL,17,Fremoval of the rubbish due to the fire
OL,18,Frisk it poses.

OL,11,FThe cost of the clear up will be
