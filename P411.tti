OL,11,FPlans have been submitted to build
OL,12,FStokes Lane solar farm on 216 acres of
OL,13,Fland in Monk Sherborne, near
OL,14,FBasingstoke.
OL,16,FHowever, villagers worry that if the

OL,11,Fquestioned the choice of site.
OL,13,F"We've got George Austen's burial

OL,18,F"So I think everybody would say that

OL,21,Fwhy they would choose this site.
