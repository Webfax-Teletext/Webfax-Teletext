OL,3,CHundreds of trees planted in Sussex to
OL,4,Crestore ancient woodland
OL,6,FOver the summer 8000 pine trees were
OL,7,Fremoved to make way for young English
OL,8,Fsaplings which will encourage birds,
OL,9,Fbutterflies, and other wildlife.
OL,11,F"Planting trees is such a great thing
OL,12,Fto do" says Steve Lewis, the current
OL,13,Fchair of the wood. "These trees will
OL,14,Fprovide a haven for birds &
OL,15,Fbutterflies for decades to come. Trees
OL,16,Fstore carbon, so mitigate the climate
OL,17,Fcrisis. And as long as the wood
OL,18,Fremains in community hands these trees
OL,19,Fwill be there for our children and
OL,20,Fgrandchildren to play and enjoy
OL,21,Fnature."

OL,8,FUK" says Debbie Pellett who grew up
OL,9,Flocally. "But after the war large
OL,10,Fareas were cut down and replaced with
OL,11,Fconifers. Little by little we are
OL,12,Fremoving the pine trees & re-planting

OL,14,Fsuch as hazel, beech and the mighty
