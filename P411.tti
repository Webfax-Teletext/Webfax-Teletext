OL,6,FWarning: this story contains details
OL,7,Fwhich some people may find distressing.
OL,9,FThe daughter of an 88-year-old
OL,10,FSouthampton woman, who had the entire
OL,11,Ftop of a toe chewed off by a rat, has
OL,12,Fdescribed her horror.
OL,14,FAndrea Scott said: "You're in
OL,15,Fdisbelief, you're like, that can't
OL,16,Fhave happened, that surely can't have.
OL,17,FBut I knew when I saw the sock because
OL,18,Fnothing else would explain that sock
OL,19,Fand that amount of damage to her toe."

OL,6,FHer mum, Joan, lives in a council-
OL,7,Fowned house. She's bed-bound and has
OL,8,Fno feeling in her legs.
OL,10,FIn April, Andrea had contacted
OL,11,FSouthampton City Council for help
OL,12,Fafter seeing a rat run across the
OL,13,Ffloor.
OL,15,FShe was told it would cost her mum
OL,16,Fnearly #300 for pest control to come
OL,17,Fand it would more than take two weeks.
OL,19,FSo she decided to lay traps and rat
OL,20,Fpoison herself, hoping it would
OL,21,Fprotect her mum.

OL,9,F"When I came in, I saw the carers were

OL,11,Fand I just saw the toe and the top of
OL,12,Fit was gone and the blood, there was
