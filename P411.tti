OL,9,F"Britain's loneliest dog", a caring

OL,12,FWoody initially came to Dogs Trust on

OL,14,Fstruggling with some of his behaviours.
OL,16,FStaff believe he might not have had
OL,17,Fthe best start in life, as he is quite
OL,18,Fa worried dog. Because of this, he is
OL,19,Flooking for adopters who understand
OL,20,Fhis need for space and respect his
OL,21,Fboundaries.

OL,6,FAs he has been with Dogs Trust for a

OL,12,FWoody requires an adult only

OL,15,Fhome with multiple adults, as his care

OL,13,FWoody's new home should be within an
