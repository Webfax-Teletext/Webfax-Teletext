OL,6,FOwner Fiona Rennie, said: "We had over

OL,9,Fof a sudden we got contact with the
OL,10,FCoast Guard to say that they had had a

OL,13,F"They had seen him balance on a rock

OL,6,F"They said that they think two people
OL,7,Fgot in the water to try and get him,
OL,8,Fwhich is a scary thought, that they
OL,9,Fwere in the water because obviously
OL,10,Fthey would put themselves at risk and
OL,11,Ftheir safety could be compromised

OL,14,FA family friend, Connor Edwards, was
OL,15,Fpart of the Margate lifeboat crew sent
OL,16,Fto save the dog.
OL,18,FHe said: "When I first spotted Bear,
OL,19,Fit was actually quite difficult
OL,20,Fbecause his colourings blended in with
OL,21,Fthe coastline.

OL,6,F"Our main priority was to cut him off
OL,7,Fbecause if he had got to the main
OL,8,Fbeach he would have got away from us
OL,9,Fagain, and then we called out his name
OL,10,Fand suddenly he was very shocked that
OL,11,Fwe knew him.
OL,13,F"So I slowly approached him but being
OL,14,Fmissing for so long he was very
OL,15,Fagitated very scared, he was a bit
OL,16,Fbarky and growly but I managed to get
OL,17,Fhold of him, calmed him down a bit.
OL,19,F"I brought him alongside the boat and
OL,20,Fhe just hopped straight in, he was
OL,21,Fperfect rescuing himself.
