OL,6,F"I originally thought it had come
OL,7,Fthrough the centre of the windscreen
OL,8,Fbut it actually came through the
OL,9,Fdriver side of the windscreen but at
OL,10,Fan angle."
OL,12,F"It took my left hand off the steering
OL,13,Fwheel and went into the passenger
OL,14,Fseat."
OL,16,FThe incident left her with a severe
OL,17,Farm injury, which was down to the
OL,18,Fbone. She will need physiotherapy to
OL,19,Fhelp regain the strength in her arm,
OL,20,Fhowever Mrs Saunders says it could
OL,21,Fhave been much worse.
