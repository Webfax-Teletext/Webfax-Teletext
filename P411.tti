OL,6,FThe family of a severely disabled West
OL,7,FBerkshire woman say she is at risk of
OL,8,Fbecoming 'a prisoner in her own home'
OL,9,Fbecause long-standing funding limits
OL,10,Fmean vital improvements to their house
OL,11,Fcan't be made.
OL,13,FCharlotte Cook, from Thatcham, was
OL,14,Fdiagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease
OL,15,Ftwo and a half years ago. The
OL,16,Fcondition is progressive and life-
OL,17,Flimiting, and she now uses a
OL,18,Fwheelchair and has difficulty speaking.
