OL,6,FAsked whether Alaa's asylum claim is

OL,8,FKay Marsh, Media and Advocacy lead at
OL,9,FSamphire, told ITV Meridian: "If you
OL,10,Flook at his story, he had a genuine

OL,13,Fto claim asylum in any country that is
OL,14,Fparty to the 1951 Refugee Convention,
OL,15,Fwhich we are, so he has a right to be

OL,15,Fsays he can't access legal aid due to
