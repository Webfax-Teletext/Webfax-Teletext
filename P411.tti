OL,6,F"This is an attack on democracy
OL,7,Fitself," said McKenna. "This is an
OL,8,Fattack on free speech. This is an
OL,9,Fattack on my constituents. Our
OL,10,Fdemocracy is based on the ability to
OL,11,Fdisagree with each other strongly, but
OL,12,Fnever violently."
OL,14,FSwale Borough Council closed its
