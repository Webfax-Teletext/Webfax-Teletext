OL,6,FWATCH: ITV Meridian's report by
OL,7,FCharlotte Wilkins
OL,9,FFor four years, a couple from Shoreham
OL,10,Fhave been battling Southern Water to
OL,11,Ffix a problem with a mains sewage pipe
OL,12,Fto their property.
OL,14,FIt transpired that the property,
OL,15,Fbelonging to Christine and Paul
OL,16,FJeffrey wasn't connected to the main
OL,17,Fsewer and Southern Water had been
OL,18,Fsending a tanker down to syphon away
OL,19,Fthe waste, something the couple were
OL,20,Funaware of when they bought the
OL,21,Fproperty.

OL,6,FBut during lockdown in 2020, when the
OL,7,Ftanker failed to turn up, sewage then
OL,8,Fstarted backing up in to their home.
OL,10,FSince then they say they've been
OL,11,Fconstantly given the run around by
OL,12,FSouthern Water to resolve the issue.
OL,14,FAfter countless emails, calls,
OL,15,Finvestigations carried out and the
OL,16,Fpromise of a pump to divert the waste
OL,17,Fin to a main sewer, it's still not
OL,18,Ffixed.
