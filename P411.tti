OL,6,FOxfordshire County Council already has

OL,8,Fhighway works, introduced in 2020. It
OL,9,Fsays, every year, it receives 30,000
OL,10,Frequests.
OL,12,FThe authority hopes it will encourage
OL,13,Fwork during off-peak hours, to reduce
OL,14,Fcosts, and for disruption to be kept
OL,15,Fto a minimum.
OL,17,FThe council says its own roadworks
OL,18,Fwill not be exempt from the charges
OL,19,Fand any surplus income from the scheme
OL,20,Fwould be invested back into the
OL,21,Fhighway network.

OL,6,FThe route isn't expected to reopen
