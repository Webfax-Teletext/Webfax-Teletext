OL,6,FResearchers from the University of
OL,7,FReading have discovered a 76 million-
OL,8,Fyear-old fossilised neck bone of a
OL,9,Fflying reptile which shows signs of
OL,10,Fbeing bitten by a crocodile-like
OL,11,Fcreature.
OL,13,FThe juvenile pterosaur vertebra was
OL,14,Ffound in Dinosaur Provincial Park,
OL,15,FAlberta, Canada, and has a circular
OL,16,Ffour-millimetre-wide puncture mark
OL,17,Ffrom a crocodile tooth.

OL,6,FThe discovery was made during an

OL,8,Fplace in July 2023, led by Dr Brian

OL,11,FDr Brian Pickles said: "Bite traces
OL,12,Fhelp to document species interactions
OL,13,Ffrom this period.
OL,15,F"We can't say if the pterosaur was
OL,16,Falive or dead when it was bitten but
OL,17,Fthe specimen shows that crocodilians
OL,18,Foccasionally preyed on, or scavenged,
OL,19,Fjuvenile pterosaurs in prehistoric
OL,20,FAlberta over 70 million years ago."
