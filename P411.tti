OL,7,FThe council removed two mini

OL,9,Fand replaced them with the leaf design

OL,12,FWhen viewed from above, the new design
OL,13,Fon the road is more clear.
OL,15,FHowever, some motorists say that
OL,16,Fwithout an obvious roundabout centre

OL,7,FReuben Miles-Brar, a local shop-owner,
OL,8,Fsaid: "Previously there were two

OL,10,Feradicate them and add in these
OL,11,Fleaves. I've seen children trying to
OL,12,Fjump across the maple leaves thinking
OL,13,Fit is hopscotch.
OL,15,F"Just a minute ago, as I pulled up, it
OL,16,Fwas chaos here with three cars. No-one
OL,17,Fknows where they're meant to be, and
OL,18,Fthey are pulling up next to one
OL,19,Fanother and shouting at one another
OL,20,Fthrough their windows. It causes chaos
OL,21,Fand frustration."

OL,17,F"Safety is one of the crucial things
