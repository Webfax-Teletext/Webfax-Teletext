OL,11,FWhile tarantulas are often viewed as

OL,14,Fbeing housed in enclosures at certain

OL,6,FHead of Reptiles at RSPCA Brighton,
OL,7,FFred Bark, said: "Tarantulas are
OL,8,Ffairly hardy, although the one that
OL,9,Fpassed away was of a species that can
OL,10,Fbe particularly affected by cold
OL,11,Ftemperatures. Generally we know fairly
OL,12,Fquickly whether they are going to be
OL,13,Fokay when they come in to us.
OL,15,F"The intake was a mix of old and new
OL,16,Fworld tarantulas, so they were
OL,17,Fdifferent species from different parts
OL,18,Fof the world, which meant each one
OL,19,Fneeded specific care. Most of them
OL,20,Fwere not fully grown, but they were
OL,21,Fstill big spiders.

OL,6,F"There are quite a few people who keep
OL,7,Ftarantulas in the Brighton area and
OL,8,Fonce we established they were going to
OL,9,Fsurvive we notified some potential
OL,10,Fadopters. Owners need the right
OL,11,Fenclosures and the knowledge to care
OL,12,Ffor them and once they'd satisfied us
