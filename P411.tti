OL,6,FAn angling charity has issued urgent
OL,7,Fadvice after a fisherman became
OL,8,Fseriously ill and collapsed after
OL,9,Ffishing in a Berkshire river.
OL,11,FMark Erdwin had spent the day casting
OL,12,Ffrom a riverbank near Finchampstead
OL,13,Fbut was rushed to hospital after
OL,14,Fbecoming violently ill following a
OL,15,Fdays fishing on the River Blackwater
OL,16,Fnear Eversley.
OL,18,FMark, who has been an angler for more
OL,19,Fthan 35 years, was found to be
OL,20,Fsuffering from the deadly E. coli
OL,21,Fbacteria.
