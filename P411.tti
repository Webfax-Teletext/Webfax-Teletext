OL,6,FCanterbury Cathedral has defended its
OL,7,Fdecision to host a silent disco,
OL,8,Fsaying it will not be a "rave in the
OL,9,Fnave" but "respectful" of the historic
OL,10,Fsite.
OL,12,FThe sell-out events for Thursday and
OL,13,FFriday will see clubbers take to the
OL,14,Fnave in a '90s-themed disco, playing
OL,15,Fthe likes of the Vengaboys, Britney
OL,16,FSpears, Spice Girls and Eminem.
OL,18,FBut the parties have come under fire
OL,19,Ffrom petitioners who say silent discos
OL,20,Fbelong in nightclubs, not "the most
OL,21,Fimportant Christian church in England".
