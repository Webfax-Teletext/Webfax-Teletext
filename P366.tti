OL,6,FA spokesperson for the vets said: "The
OL,7,Fadders come out in hot weather to
OL,8,Fsunbathe and dogs are often bitten on
OL,9,Fthe mouth as they try to grab the
OL,10,Fsnake or on their paws as they try to
OL,11,Fwork out what the creature is."
OL,13,FOne of the dogs that was bitten by an
OL,14,Fadder was Malc, who's owners said they
OL,15,F"can't praise the vets enough."
OL,17,FMalc's owners advised other dog
OL,18,Fwalkers to ensure they don't stop if
OL,19,Fthey see an adder, as an "inquisitive
OL,20,Fdog may think it's interesting too."
