OL,5,FDet Ch Supt Tanya Wilkins said: "The
OL,6,Fvictim has shown immense courage in
OL,7,Fcoming forward to report these
OL,8,Foffences. We do not underestimate how
OL,9,Fhard it is to report such offending in
OL,10,Fany circumstances but understand that
OL,11,Fthere may also be additional concerns
OL,12,Fwhen the perpetrator works in policing.
OL,14,F"I hope the investigation and
OL,15,Fsubsequent prosecution show that
OL,16,Fpolice and partners will take action,
OL,17,Fregardless of the occupation of the
OL,18,Foffender."
