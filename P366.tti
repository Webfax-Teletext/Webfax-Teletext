OL,7,Fsaid two underground pipes had been
OL,8,Fdamaged - but it was unclear how.
OL,10,F"There were two assets that are
OL,11,Fdamaged," he said. "One's our sewer -
OL,12,Fthat's repaired. The other is a
OL,13,Fcouncil asset - the culvert. That's
OL,14,Fwhat we're in the process repairing at
OL,15,Fthe moment.
OL,17,F"We're collaborating very closely and
OL,18,Fwe'll be doing a root cause to
OL,19,Funderstand exactly what's led to the
OL,20,Ffailure of those two assets."
