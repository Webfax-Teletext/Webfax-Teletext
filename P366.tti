OL,9,FI could hear everything and I was

OL,8,Fvisiting family in his home city when
OL,9,Fthe attack happened on Boxing Day.
OL,11,FSharon Syron, Matthew's mum, said: "It
OL,12,Fwas like a horror movie, his eyes were
OL,13,Fbleeding and he was just screaming in
OL,14,Fpain. I think they got him in within
OL,15,Ffive hours. If they hadn't have done,
OL,16,Fhe'd had lost both eyes. To witness
OL,17,Fthat as a mother, just horrific,
OL,18,Fhorrific."
