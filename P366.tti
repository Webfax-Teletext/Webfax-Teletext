OL,9,FWhen Chris Marriott saw a stranger

OL,12,Fhelp was, friends say, typical.
OL,14,F"It was who he was," Natalie Williams

OL,17,F"He was a good Samaritan actually,

OL,7,Ffather-of-two, in her capacity as
OL,8,Fchief executive of the charity Jubilee
OL,9,FPlus. Mr Marriott, who was 46, was a
OL,10,Fvolunteer.
OL,12,FHe also worked at a foodbank in
OL,13,FSheffield.
OL,15,F"When I heard that he went to stop to
OL,16,Fhelp someone in the road, it was
OL,17,Fentirely in keeping with his
OL,18,Fcharacter," Ms Williams said. "It's
OL,19,Fexactly what I would expect Chris to
OL,20,Fdo in that situation - to go and help
OL,21,Fsomeone."
