OL,10,FWaltham Windmill, in Lincolnshire, was

OL,14,FThe former flour mill has been run as
OL,15,Fa working museum since the 1980s,
OL,16,Ftelling the story of its agricultural

OL,6,FUntil recently it milled once a month,
OL,7,Fits six sails powered by the wind
OL,8,Fcoming off the North Sea.
OL,10,FBut decades of exposure to the

OL,13,FPeter Kingsford, a volunteer at the
OL,14,FWaltham Windmill Preservation Society,
OL,15,Fsaid: "I think in most of these lovely
OL,16,Fold things - people can take them a

OL,19,F"We need to make an awareness that
OL,20,Fthey are extremely vulnerable and it
OL,21,Fis a case of use it or lose it."

OL,6,FJane Holt, an architect for Historic
