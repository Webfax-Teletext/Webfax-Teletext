OL,6,FHe faced objections from neighbours
OL,7,Fwhen he had to apply for retrospective
OL,8,Fplanning permission for five new
OL,9,Fmodels outside his house, including
OL,10,Ffour two-metre RAF plane sculptures.
OL,11,FHe also has a large metal dragon.
OL,13,FBut he was relieved when he was told
OL,14,Fhe could keep them.
OL,16,FMr Norris said he has had people
OL,17,Fcoming to his house to request a tour.
OL,19,FHe said they were "in keeping with the

OL,6,F"Everyone has a different idea as to
OL,7,Fwhat they like in their garden and
OL,8,Fthis is mine," he said.
OL,10,F"I didn't do it to capture local

OL,12,Fplanes, I like them. I take a good
OL,13,Finterest in my garden, I just
OL,14,Fpersonally think it's in keeping with
OL,15,Fthe local area.
OL,17,F"We have sky divers and planes coming

OL,6,FNeighbours had voiced strong
OL,7,Fopposition to the sculptures, with one
OL,8,Fcommenting that Mr Norris gave "no
OL,9,Fconsideration to the surrounding
OL,10,Fresidents or wider neighbourhood".
OL,12,FOne resident said it looked like Mr

OL,6,FMr Norris's nextdoor neighbour Valerie
OL,7,FMoore was among those who objected.
OL,8,FShe said safety was her main concern.
OL,10,F"If the fixings fail, it could drop
OL,11,Fonto our property and cause injury or
OL,12,Fdamage," she said.
OL,14,F"No consideration was shown to the
OL,15,Fneighbours and the neighbourhood, it's
OL,16,Fnot a theme park.
OL,18,F"Yes they're probably quite nice
OL,19,Fmodels in their own environment, but
OL,20,Fthey're not suitable for a front
OL,21,Fgarden on a residential area."

OL,6,FHowever, fellow neighbour Keith Davis
OL,7,Fsaid he has "no real problems at all"
OL,8,Fwith the sculptures.
OL,10,F"They're part of our heritage," he
OL,11,Fsaid. "Alright, they might be a bit
OL,12,Fbig but I've got a caravan stuck in
OL,13,Fthe garden, a lot of people have.
OL,14,FThey're surely more objectionable than

OL,17,FDespite the controversy, the
OL,18,Fsculptures will remain as a permanent
OL,19,Ffixture in the neighbourhood.
