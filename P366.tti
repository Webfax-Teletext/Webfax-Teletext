OL,10,FLincoln Crown Court heard Sheppard, of

OL,13,FMablethorpe after finishing her job as

OL,6,FDavid Eager, prosecuting, said
OL,7,FSheppard had sent her partner a

OL,9,Fwhich said: "My tyre is going flat
OL,10,Fagain."
OL,12,FThe man had checked the wrong tyre,
OL,13,Fwhich gave a reading of 32 psi.
OL,15,F"Sadly, tragically, he did not check

OL,19,FThe court heard another driver noticed
