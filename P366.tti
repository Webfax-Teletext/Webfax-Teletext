OL,6,FA deer has died after it was chased by
OL,7,Fpeople on a beach in Cleethorpes, an
OL,8,Fanimal welfare group has said.
OL,10,FFour to five deers were spotted on the
OL,11,Fbeach, which the group says is not
OL,12,Funcommon because of surrounding grassy
OL,13,Fareas that offer natural food sources.
OL,15,FMembers of the public were seen
OL,16,Fchasing the deer which caused the
OL,17,Fanimal "unnecessary stress", leading
OL,18,Fto panic and exhaustion.
OL,20,FThe wildlife rescue said it is unsure
OL,21,Fwhether the people were trying to help.

OL,6,F"A heartfelt thank you to East Lincs

OL,12,FIt added: "Deer are extremely

OL,14,Fpost-capture myopathy ` a condition
OL,15,Ftriggered by extreme stress that can,

OL,18,FThe has also urged members of the
OL,19,Fpublic to avoid interacting with deer
OL,20,Fon the beach, due to the sensitivity
OL,21,Fof the specie.
