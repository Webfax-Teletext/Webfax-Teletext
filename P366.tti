OL,6,FLet's start with the basics - a
OL,7,Ftornado is a violently rotating column
OL,8,Fof air that is in contact with both
OL,9,Fthe surface of the Earth and a
OL,10,Fcumulonimbus cloud.
OL,12,FThey're most common in central and
OL,13,Feastern parts of the United States,
OL,14,Falthough around 30 a year are reported
OL,15,Fin the UK.
OL,17,FThere was certainly enough instability
OL,18,Fin the atmosphere on Thursday for
OL,19,Fthere to be the possibility of a
OL,20,Ftornado to form here - rapidly rising
OL,21,Fair and a warm and moist atmosphere.
