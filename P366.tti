OL,7,FOn Thursday, 26 June, the Parole Board
OL,8,Fsaid a panel had recommended his
OL,9,F"placement in open conditions" which
OL,10,Fwould see him moved from a Category C
OL,11,Fprison to an open prison.
OL,13,FMiss Simpson's sisters, Krista Simpson
OL,14,Fand Naomi Carrack have criticised the
OL,15,Fpanel's decision saying they want
OL,16,F"justice for Gemma".
OL,18,FThey said: "Why is he even allowed to
OL,19,Fapply for parole when us and Gemma
OL,20,Fwere kept prisoner for over 14 years?
