OL,6,FNow Mrs Castledine has started
OL,7,Fteaching her pupils at Newlands Junior
OL,8,FSchool, in Mansfield, about the
OL,9,Fconsequences of knife crime to deter
OL,10,Fthem from a life of crime.
OL,12,FShe said: "(Danny's killer) turned to
OL,13,Fcrime when he was at school. If he had
OL,14,Fdone something like we're doing with
OL,15,Four pupils then maybe he would have
OL,16,Ftaken a different path and Danny's
OL,17,Fdeath would never have happened.
