OL,6,FEight Greenpeace protesters have been
OL,7,Farrested after they scaled two 75-
OL,8,Fmetre high chimney stacks at England's
OL,9,Flargest gas-fired power station.
OL,11,FThe campaigners climbed maintenance
OL,12,Fladders at Staythorpe Power Station in
OL,13,FNewark, Nottinghamshire, on Monday
OL,14,Fmorning and displayed a banner
OL,15,Freading: "The Great Gas Rip-Off: Now
OL,16,Fon!"
OL,18,FAll eight have since climbed down from
OL,19,Fthe chimneys and were arrested on
OL,20,Fsuspicion of aggravated trespassing.

OL,6,FGreenpeace said the action aimed to

OL,8,Fprice of gas, which is exposed to
OL,9,Fglobal shocks such as conflict and
OL,10,Ftrade restrictions, is almost always
OL,11,Fthe main factor in establishing the UK

OL,14,FThis is despite gas only generating a

OL,17,Fsuch as wind, solar and nuclear.
