OL,7,Fthought we started both halves well
OL,8,Fand people might laugh and say that's
OL,9,Fa bit of a strong word but we did.
OL,11,F"We passed the ball well, we got into

OL,15,F"I do think we were shooting a bit

OL,18,Fto get in behind."

OL,11,F"I think it's probably one of their

OL,14,Fand he's able to check inside and get

OL,17,FHe added: "Again, we start the second-

OL,19,Fa horrible goal to give away.
OL,21,F"After that, we just went to pieces.
