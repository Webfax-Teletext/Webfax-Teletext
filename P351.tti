OL,6,FVolunteers say that in the winter
OL,7,Fcalls for help and rescues increase,
OL,8,Fbut many of them are avoidable and
OL,9,Faren't due to serious injury or
OL,10,Fillness, but lack of equipment and
OL,11,Fability.
OL,13,F"Unless you can look after yourself in

OL,15,Fthen you've got less time in the day
OL,16,Fto get home safe," says Nick Owen, a
