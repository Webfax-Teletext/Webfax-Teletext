OL,3,CAuld Lang Syne: The fight to save the
OL,4,Csong's Scottish birthplace
OL,6,FNew Year's Eve celebrations frequently
OL,7,Finclude a rendition of 'Auld Lang
OL,8,FSyne'.
OL,10,FThe Scottish song is bellowed by
OL,11,Fmillions across the English-speaking
OL,12,Fworld after the clock hits midnight -
OL,13,Fincluding in the UK, Australia, New
OL,14,FZealand, Canada and the USA.
OL,16,FBut, despite its now worldwide fame,
OL,17,Fthe song started from humble
OL,18,Fbeginnings, written in a secluded part
OL,19,Fof Dumfries and Galloway.

OL,6,FEllisland Farm was the home of Robert
OL,7,FBurns, and that is where the poet put
OL,8,Fpen to paper to write the song back in
OL,9,F1788.
OL,11,F"Auld Lang Syne is one of our biggest
OL,12,Fexports - the most sung song in the
OL,13,Fworld after Happy Birthday," says Joan

OL,6,F"It absolutely needs to change, it's a
OL,7,Fsong that is so special to people,
OL,8,Fit's a very emotional song. When you
OL,9,Fsing it you're thinking about your own
OL,10,Ffamily, your loved ones, your past,
OL,11,Fmaybe people who aren't here anymore."
OL,13,F"It's such a special song, it's a

OL,15,Fadds.
OL,17,FEllisland still stands as a museum -
OL,18,Fbut those who run it launched a

OL,20,Fsave it from closure.

OL,10,FThe team says the buildings are

OL,14,F"If the site were to achieve half the
OL,15,Flevels of the visitor numbers that the
