OL,7,GBBC.  But it's also the start of a
OL,8,Gweek which could remind the BBC's
OL,9,Gnatural supporters of one of its key
OL,10,Gstrengths.
OL,12,FThe resignation of the chairman came
OL,13,Fafter weeks of speculation over his
OL,14,Ffuture.
OL,16,FOf course, the chairman is not
OL,17,Fresponsible for editorial decisions.
OL,18,FBut even the impression that he may
OL,19,Fhave been a political appointee is

OL,6,FFor those who want to believe there
OL,7,Fis right wing bias in all of the
OL,8,Fmainstream media, it seemed like
OL,9,Fproof.
OL,11,FOthers worried the chairman was being
OL,12,Fsent in to "sort out" the BBC by
OL,13,FBoris Johnson ` just as they worried
OL,14,Fthat the planned privatisation of
OL,15,FChannel 4 was also about taming
OL,16,Fjournalism.
OL,18,FBut there is a distinction between
OL,19,Fwanting to ensure that public sector
OL,20,Fappointments are made in the
OL,21,Fappropriate way and accusations of
OL,22,Fbias in journalism.

OL,6,FAs a general rule, those who want to
OL,7,Fsee bias will always find evidence to
OL,8,Ffit their conclusion.
OL,10,FAnd those with a long memory know
OL,11,Fthat governments of all hues have
OL,12,Faccused the BBC of bias against them
OL,13,Fat various points in time.
OL,15,FWhat really matters is what the
OL,16,Fbroader public think. This is why it
OL,17,Fis so important to ensure the
OL,18,Fchairman enjoys full public
OL,19,Fconfidence. He is a figurehead for
OL,20,Fthe corporation's independence.

OL,11,Fwhat most of the BBC's supporters
OL,12,Frightly expect of it.
OL,14,FMany who may not consider themselves
