OL,6,FThe way it was implemented is thanks to
OL,7,Fthe fact almost all satellite TV
OL,8,Fviewers are reliant on either Sky or
OL,9,FFreesat and the various specifications
OL,10,Fand configurations related to those
OL,11,Fplatforms. It means most viewers will
OL,12,Fnever have to retune their satellite

OL,15,FChannel numbering is dictated by the
OL,16,Fplatform and when broadcasters like the
OL,17,FBBC make changes, it's all about
OL,18,Fensuring Sky and Freesat automatically

OL,10,Fwork mean broadcasters don't have to

OL,6,FThe BBC now has five HD channels per

OL,11,FBut where a broadcaster needs to carry
OL,12,Fmultiple versions of the same channel,
OL,13,Fshowing the same thing at the same
