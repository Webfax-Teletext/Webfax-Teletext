OL,6,FAnimal keeper at Dalscone, Ben Best
OL,7,Fsaid: "On Saturday morning, when we

OL,9,Fit was a very stressful and really
OL,10,Ffrantic looking around the farm to see
OL,11,Fwhere on earth they were.
OL,13,F"This was until, thankfully, we got

OL,6,F"A resident had phoned in and she had
OL,7,Ftwo porcupines in her garden. She
OL,8,Fasked 'did they, by any chance, happen
OL,9,Fto be ours?' And I said that
OL,10,Funfortunately, they were."
OL,12,FBecause they were new animals to the
OL,13,Fpark, the pair didn't have names
OL,14,Fbefore the weekend.
OL,16,FSince their escape, they have been

OL,18,Fability to move a great distance in a
