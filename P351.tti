OL,12,FThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch

OL,15,Fmonitoring kit "may not be able to

OL,17,Fcircumstances," and that this issue
OL,18,Fwould be most likely in "severe

OL,7,FOn the Shap derailment last month, the
OL,8,FRAIB found that sensors detected minor
OL,9,Fmovement four hours before the
OL,10,Fderailment, at a level below the
OL,11,Fthreshold to trigger the least serious
OL,12,Falert.
OL,14,FAt around 4:30am, when the landslip is
OL,15,Fbelieved to have occurred, two sensors
OL,16,Fwere knocked over and subsumed by the
OL,17,Flandslip. This happened too quickly
OL,18,Ffor the sensors to generate an alert
OL,19,Ffor the movement.
