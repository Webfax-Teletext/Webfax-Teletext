OL,5,FThe opening seconds of tonight's      
OL,6,Fedition of the ITV Evening News has   
OL,7,Fbeen viewed tens of thousands of times
OL,8,Fon social media.                      
OL,10,FPresenter Mary Nightingale was        
OL,11,Fproviding the opening link to camera, 
OL,12,Flive from Downing Street, when someone
OL,13,Fbriefly passed in front of the camera.
OL,14,FA slight wobble in Mary's voice was

OL,5,FOn BBC Two Wales, a minor mishap with 
OL,6,Fthe playout schedule meant we got a few
OL,7,Fseconds of BBC One's one rolling news 
OL,8,Fcoverage, rather than the start of    
OL,9,FPointless.                            
OL,11,FThe issue was quickly rectified.      
OL,13,FOn the day that Liz Truss was formally
OL,14,Finstalled as the UK prime minister,   
OL,15,FNewsnight produced a short montage of 
OL,16,Fimages from the day's events,

OL,5,FOrdinarily, the programme's opening

OL,9,FStuart Denman: "We recorded this longer
OL,10,Fversion when we updated the opening   
OL,11,Ftheme in 2019. We're such terrible    
OL,12,Ftimekeepers though we used the opening
