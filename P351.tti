OL,13,FAs expected, BBC One took the

OL,15,F` while impressive ` the headline

OL,6,FThe two channels are very different `

OL,15,FIt should be stressed that Channel 4
OL,16,Fstill outperforms Channel 5 overall `
OL,17,Feven before its wider portfolio of

OL,13,FBut I can't help but see problems.
OL,15,FYou can easily imagine a week or

OL,17,FChannel 4's main service.
