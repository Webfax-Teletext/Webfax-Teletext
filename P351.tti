OL,7,GAfter months of waiting, BT and WBD
OL,8,Gconfirmed today that BT Sport will be
OL,9,Grebranded TNT Sports this July.
OL,11,FThe rebrand became necessary after BT
OL,12,Fand Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) entered
OL,13,Fa joint venture last year, resulting in
OL,14,Fthe operational merger of their
OL,15,Frespective sports channel businesses in
OL,16,Fthe UK and Ireland.
OL,18,FBT is also in the process of
OL,19,Ftransferring its consumer-facing
OL,20,Fbusiness to EE, meaning the BT brand is
OL,21,Fgradually being removed altogether from
OL,22,Fits non-B2B services.
