OL,6,FThe family of a runner killed by a low-
OL,7,Fhanging electricity cable has issued a
OL,8,Fstatement, following the conclusion of
OL,9,Fan inquest into his death.
OL,11,F29-year-old John Henry Oates, known as
OL,12,FHarry, was found dead near Kendal on
OL,13,FOctober 27, 2023.
OL,15,FAn inquest concluded that a "rare and
OL,16,Fcomplex sequence of events" led to his
OL,17,Fdeath, after he came into contact with
OL,18,Fan electricity cable.

OL,6,FMr Oates' family has now said it
OL,7,Fbelieves "this was not a random or

OL,10,FIn a statement, they said: "There were
OL,11,Fmissed opportunities to prevent what
OL,12,Fhappened, and similar incidents have
OL,13,Foccurred before. The wider risks were
OL,14,Fnot addressed, and there was a
OL,15,Freluctance to acknowledge this.

OL,13,F"What is also alarming to us is that
