OL,6,FA family from Kendal is campaigning to
OL,7,Fgive mothers more time with their
OL,8,Fstillborn babies.
OL,10,FWhen Chelsea Turrell went into labour,
OL,11,Fshe imagined the baby she'd bring home
OL,12,Ffrom the hospital. But doctors
OL,13,Fcouldn't find a heartbeat. She gave
OL,14,Fbirth, knowing her baby Romeo was
OL,15,Falready gone.

OL,6,F"We didn't want to see him at first.

OL,8,Fwas it. We just became obsessed with

OL,10,Funfortunately, was no longer alive,"
OL,11,Fsaid Chelsea.
OL,13,F"We were processing all these

OL,15,Fnavigate this time, you know, how best
OL,16,Fto look after him. Would we be able to
OL,17,Fbathe him? Would we get to dress him?

OL,6,F"There were so many questions that we

OL,11,FThe hospital had a cooling cot and a
OL,12,Fsmaller scale cuddle cot so they could
OL,13,Fbring their baby home.
OL,15,FWhat is a cooling cot?
OL,17,FA cooling cot has a system that
OL,18,Fcirculates chilled water through a
OL,19,Fthin pad that can be wrapped around
OL,20,Fthe baby, or placed under a mattress
OL,21,Fin a cot or Moses basket.
