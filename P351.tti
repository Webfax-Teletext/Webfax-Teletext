OL,6,FFinds Officer Julie Shoemark spoke of
OL,7,Fher delight at finding the discovery.
OL,9,FShe said: "This particular discovery
OL,10,Fby itself is a remarkable find. It is
OL,11,Fa wonderful survivor of roman
OL,12,Fcraftsmanship and artistry.
OL,14,F"The size of the weight is definitely
OL,15,Fsurprising. These weights usually tend
OL,16,Fto be a little bit smaller. I would
OL,17,Fsay one in this condition and one
OL,18,Fdepicting Silenus particularly is a
OL,19,Flittle more unusual I have only found
OL,20,Fone good parallel for him."
