OL,6,FA Guernsey woman who helped to crack
OL,7,FGerman enemy codes during the Second

OL,10,FMarjorie Dodsworth was a member of the
OL,11,Felite team of codebreakers that
OL,12,Fcracked the infamous Enigma code.
OL,14,FAs a young Royal Navy wren, Marjorie
OL,15,Fworked at Bletchley Park as an
OL,16,Foperator of a Bombe: the device used
OL,17,Fto decipher German Enigma machine-
OL,18,Fencrypted messages.

OL,6,FThe operations were highly

OL,8,FMarjorie didn't tell a soul what she'd
OL,9,Fdone.
OL,11,FHowever, 50 years after she'd signed
OL,12,Fthe Official Secrets Act, she finally
OL,13,Ftold her husband and sons her story.
OL,15,FIan Dodsworth, Marjorie's son, says
OL,16,Fhe'll never forget that moment,
OL,17,Frecalling: "We were sat around for
OL,18,FSunday lunch, and she said 'Today is
OL,19,Fthe day I can tell you what I did in
OL,20,Fthe war. I worked at Bletchley.'

OL,6,F"Dad was beside himself because he

OL,10,F"She signed the Official Secrets Act

OL,6,FHe furthers: "I think she still felt
OL,7,Fit should be kept secret. So she
OL,8,Fdidn't speak an awful lot about it.
OL,9,FShe did interviews and she's spoken to

OL,6,FThis is not how history will remember
OL,7,FMarjorie, however.
OL,9,FWinston Churchill believed the work of
OL,10,Fthe team at Bletchley Park was so
OL,11,Fimportant that he nicknamed them 'the
