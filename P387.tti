OL,6,FThe decision to deny their appeals was
OL,7,Freached on Wednesday 23 October.
OL,9,FSpeaking after the decision, John
OL,10,FSutherland says: "Obviously I'm
OL,11,Fdisappointed. There's always a fine
OL,12,Fglimmer of hope that something might
OL,13,Fhave come from this but I don't think
OL,14,Fwe ever expected that it was going to

OL,17,FTom Le Sauteur says that while it
OL,18,Fwasn't "the ideal scenario", he
OL,19,Fexplains that Jersey appeals are hard
OL,20,Fto achieve and that the pair were
OL,21,F"prepared" for the denial.

OL,9,FThe verdict followed an eight-day

OL,9,Fwas struggling to breathe, and provide
