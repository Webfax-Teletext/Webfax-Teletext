OL,4,Ccondemned by MPs
OL,6,FMPs in the UK have raised concerns
OL,7,Fabout Jersey's French ID card scheme,
OL,8,Fsaying it opens a "backdoor route into
OL,9,Fthe UK" for potential illegal
OL,10,Fimmigrants.
OL,12,FThe ID card scheme grants French
OL,13,Fvisitors access to the island for the
OL,14,Fday without the need for a passport.
OL,16,FIt was introduced in both Bailiwicks
OL,17,Fin 2023, after it was found the number
OL,18,Fof day trippers had fallen post-Brexit
OL,19,F- and last week, Jersey's government
OL,20,Fvoted unanimously to extend the scheme
OL,21,Fon the basis of its success.
