OL,6,FThe Guernsey Boatowners Association
OL,7,Fhave presented a petition to the
OL,8,FStates of Guernsey objecting to
OL,9,Fproposed mooring fee increases.
OL,11,FThe petition, which has obtained over
OL,12,F1,200 signatures from local
OL,13,Fboatowners, describes the proposed
OL,14,Fincreases for 2025 and 2026 as
OL,15,F"inequitable to the long-term
OL,16,Fdetriment of the local leisure marine
OL,17,Fuser groups".

OL,6,FIt is a culmination of months of
OL,7,Fcampaigning from Guernsey's
OL,8,Fboatowners, yacht clubs, and trade
OL,9,Fassociations.
OL,11,FTheir work has already encouraged the
OL,12,FStates' Trading Supervisory Board
OL,13,F(STSB) to reduce their proposed
OL,14,Fincreases for 2025 from an average of
OL,15,F25% to 8.3%.
OL,17,FThe STSB has yet to propose a figure
OL,18,Ffor 2026; however, they have
OL,19,Frecommended a "similarly modest"
OL,20,Fincrease, but boatowners are still
OL,21,Funsatisfied.

OL,12,FHe says: "The petition has already had
