OL,6,Fgovernment is being urged to act fast
OL,7,Fto tackle the issue of homelessness in
OL,8,Fthe island.JIn the last week, evidence
OL,9,Fhas been found indicating that people
OL,10,Fare seeking shelter in remote bunkers.
OL,12,FOne charity says that this, coupled
OL,13,Fwith a photo showing a man openly
OL,14,Fsleeping rough under the ATM machines
OL,15,Fin a St Peter Port Bank, ensure that a

OL,12,F"Seeing visible evidence of rough
