OL,6,FA former Sark GP has successfully

OL,8,FGuernsey's lead doctor which called
OL,9,Fher ability to practice into question.
OL,11,FDr Simone Borchardt has been fighting
OL,12,Fa legal battle with Dr Peter Rabey,
OL,13,FGuernsey's Medical Director, for the
OL,14,Flast 18 months, something she has
OL,15,Fdescribed as "hell".
OL,17,FDr Borchardt worked in Sark between
OL,18,F2020 and last April when she resigned.

OL,6,FDr Borchardt also claimed her evidence
