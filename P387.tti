OL,3,CWhy Guernsey's parental leave is among
OL,4,Cthe worst in the Western world
OL,6,FNew parents in Guernsey say they are
OL,7,Ffrustrated over the island's parental
OL,8,Fleave provision, which is among the
OL,9,Fworst in the Western world.
OL,11,FUnlike Jersey and the UK, Guernsey
OL,12,Fdoes not force employers to offer paid
OL,13,Fmaternity or paternity leave. Instead,
OL,14,Fparents can receive a statutory
OL,15,Fallowance that is less than minimum
OL,16,Fwage.

OL,6,FOne mother, Constance Walden, says:
OL,7,F"Every mother I spoke to at some stage
OL,8,Fwas concerned that, financially, they
OL,9,Fweren't being paid for a period of
OL,10,Ftheir maternity at least. It's a shame
OL,11,Fwe don't have that same assistance."
OL,13,FConstance adds that some islanders are
OL,14,Fhaving to dip into savings to cover
OL,15,Fthe difference.
OL,17,FShe explains: "Obviously, it wasn't a
OL,18,Fsurprise knowing what I was going to
OL,19,Fbe paid; it was part of my contract.

OL,6,F"But the reality of when you are

OL,8,Fis very different. I did rely on my

OL,11,FThe amount of maternity leave a mother

OL,13,Fin Jersey and the UK, and as it
OL,14,Fstands, there is no legal requirement

OL,17,FAlso, teacher Kat Arlington found out
OL,18,Fthat if a parent has not been on the
OL,19,Fisland long enough, they are not
OL,20,Feligible for the full 26 weeks.
