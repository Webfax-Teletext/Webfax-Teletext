OL,6,FBuilding consensus is at the core of
OL,7,FLyndon Farnham's new top team.
OL,9,FHis picks include ministers from the
OL,10,Fprevious government - even Farnham's
OL,11,Fdefeated rival for the top job Ian
OL,12,FGorst gets a nomination - as well as
OL,13,Fmembers of Reform Jersey and the
OL,14,FConstables.
OL,16,FIt's an attempt to create unity in an
OL,17,Fassembly that has been divided over
OL,18,Fmajor votes in the past few weeks with
OL,19,Fboth the Vote of No Confidence and the
OL,20,FChief Minister election ending up as
OL,21,F27-22 results.
