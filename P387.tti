OL,6,FThe GSPCA has issued advice concerning
OL,7,Fthe welfare of lone baby birds and how
OL,8,Fislanders can help to increase their
OL,9,Fchances of survival.
OL,11,FSince the beginning of spring, the
OL,12,Fcharity has had an influx of
OL,13,Ffledglings coming through their doors
OL,14,Fin need of care.
OL,16,FPeople often see the young birds and
OL,17,Fbelieve they are in danger - according
OL,18,Fto the GSPCA, when a fledgling is
OL,19,Falone, its parent is not usually far
OL,20,Faway collecting food but will not
OL,21,Freturn until you have gone.

OL,6,FThe GSPCA Manager, Steve Byrne, says:
OL,7,F"A baby bird has a greater chance of
OL,8,Fsurvival in the wild than being hand-
OL,9,Freared as they learn how to forage for
OL,10,Ffood and fend for themselves from
OL,11,Ftheir parents.
OL,13,F"From hatching, most birds take on
OL,14,Faverage 2 weeks or more to learn how
OL,15,Fto fly.
