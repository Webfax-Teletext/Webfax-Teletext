OL,8,Fthe very first Jerriais-French
OL,9,FDictionary was essentially the work of
OL,10,Fa single person from St Ouen.
OL,12,FThe late Dr Frank Le Maistre published
OL,13,Fthis Jerriais-French dictionary in
OL,14,F1966. He spent decades noting down
OL,15,Fwords in Jerriais from conversations
OL,16,Fhe had with thousands of Jersey people.
OL,18,FDr Le Maistre's son, Francois, grew up
OL,19,Fonly speaking Jerriais from birth and
OL,20,Fstarted learning English when he went
OL,21,Fto school at the of seven.
