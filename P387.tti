OL,6,FA litter of kittens has been rescued
OL,7,Ffrom an owl nesting box in a Guernsey
OL,8,Fgarden after the babies' mother
OL,9,Fdecided to give birth there.
OL,11,FThe four kittens were left stranded 20

OL,13,Fhand to save them.
OL,15,FSue Vidamour, who has been rescuing
OL,16,Fanimals for 25 years, said she was
OL,17,F"quite shocked".

OL,6,FShe explains: "I didn't quite believe
OL,7,Fhow a cat would go 20 feet up when
OL,8,Fthere were lots of other buildings
OL,9,Fthat she could have hidden, but it was
OL,10,Fquite clever because she was very snug
OL,11,Fin there."
OL,13,FSue says the litter could have become
OL,14,F"a feral colony" if she had not
OL,15,Frescued them, something she believes
OL,16,Fwould have been a problem.

OL,11,Fand so on and so on, but it's not good

OL,14,FThe two female kittens, Tsunami and

OL,6,FVets4Pets St Martin vet Naomi Langlois
OL,7,Fhas been caring for the duo since they
