OL,7,FIt was the morning of Easter Monday,

OL,9,FSaint-Malo had left St Helier harbour.
OL,11,FThe passenger ferry boat carried
OL,12,Fmostly French and German tourists on a
OL,13,Fday trip to Sark.
OL,15,FHowever, when traversing the south-

OL,17,Fstruck a half-submerged rock and
OL,18,Fimmediately took on water.
