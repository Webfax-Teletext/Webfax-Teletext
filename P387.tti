OL,6,FGemma Powell from Jersey is in Orlando
OL,7,Fand although she is not expecting to
OL,8,Fbe hit too badly, she says she'll stay
OL,9,Fput in her hotel until it passes.
OL,11,FShe said: "The hotels here are built
OL,12,Ffor it. We are going to sit and try
OL,13,Fand make the most of the situation -
OL,14,Fas there is little we can do."
OL,16,FJulian Heming from the Met Office
OL,17,Fsaid: "When you get a really intense
OL,18,Fhurricane like Milton, then what
OL,19,Fhappens is that the strong winds tend
OL,20,Fto pile up the ocean surface to push a
OL,21,Fwall of water up against the coastline.
