OL,6,FA man from Alderney says his wife's
OL,7,Flife is being "shortened" because they
OL,8,Fcannot access vital kidney dialysis
OL,9,Ftreatment on the island.
OL,11,FIt comes after Guernsey's Health and

OL,13,Fthat Alderney dialysis patients must

OL,18,FIt adds that the committee will
