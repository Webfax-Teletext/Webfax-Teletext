OL,8,F"Homelessness is often a hidden issue
OL,9,Fin Guernsey, but it is a reality for
OL,10,Ffar too many.
OL,12,F"The rising cost of living and

OL,17,F"Our modular housing project is more
OL,18,Fthan just a shelter; it's about giving

OL,20,Fcommunity to belong to, and a chance
OL,21,Fto rebuild their lives with dignity."
