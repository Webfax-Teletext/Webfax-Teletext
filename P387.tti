OL,4,Cpower of organ transplants
OL,6,FA Jersey woman is telling her story of
OL,7,Flife after an organ transplant, with
OL,8,Fthe hope it'll encourage islanders to
OL,9,Fhave necessary conversations with
OL,10,Ftheir loved ones about the possibility
OL,11,Fof donating their organs.
OL,13,FFourteen years ago, Anna-Marie
OL,14,FVidegrain's kidneys stopped working
OL,15,Fafter a lifetime of chronic illness.
OL,17,FShe was forced to spend three days a
OL,18,Fweek in the hospital, receiving the
OL,19,Fnecessary dialysis treatment to keep
OL,20,Fher alive.
