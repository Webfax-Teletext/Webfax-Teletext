OL,6,FThe former Director General of UK
OL,7,FBorder Force has warned there is a
OL,8,F'potential risk' of onward illegal
OL,9,Ftravel to Britain under the Channel
OL,10,FIslands' French day-tripper schemes.
OL,12,FTony Smith, who led the British
OL,13,Ffrontline border control command
OL,14,Fbetween 2012 and 2013, says the
OL,15,Finitiatives have created a 'dilemma'
OL,16,Ffor authorities because French
OL,17,Fnationals can travel to Jersey and
OL,18,FGuernsey for day trips without a
OL,19,Fpassport or an Electronic Travel
OL,20,FAuthorisation (ETA).
