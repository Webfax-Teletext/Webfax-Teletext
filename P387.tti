OL,4,Cresignation of disgraced politician
OL,6,FThe leader of Guernsey's government
OL,7,Fhas called for the resignation of a
OL,8,Fdisgraced politician who admitted to
OL,9,Fpossessing more than 2,400 indecent
OL,10,Fimages of children.
OL,12,FOn Thursday 4 December, Deputy
OL,13,FJonathan Le Tocq pleaded guilty to 15
OL,14,Fsexual offences at Guernsey's Royal
OL,15,FCourt.
OL,17,FHowever, despite stepping down from
OL,18,Fthe island's top government committee,
OL,19,FPolicy and Resources (P&R), the
OL,20,Fpolitician is still a member of the
OL,21,FStates of Guernsey.

OL,6,FOne of the main issues is that the law
OL,7,Fdoes not provide an adequate way to

OL,9,Fremove him without pay.
OL,11,F"The Reform Law is not an easy law to

OL,13,Fexplained. "I'd reiterate that I'm

OL,16,Fthat we also consider whether our laws
