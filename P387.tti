OL,15,Fas many events as possible but what a
OL,16,Flot of them do not realise is the fact

OL,6,FIn response to worries over whether

OL,8,Fits current form, Joao explains:
OL,9,F"Again, if there are not enough
OL,10,Fhonorary officers available, you
OL,11,Fcannot just let floats go up by

OL,14,FBattle of Flowers is safe in the short
OL,15,Fterm, but it all depends on events
OL,16,Fhaving more volunteers.
OL,18,FThe issue is about paid events which
OL,19,Fare heavily reliant on unpaid police
OL,20,Fofficers giving up their time.
