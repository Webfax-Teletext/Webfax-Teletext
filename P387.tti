OL,8,Frunning workshops giving people the
OL,9,Fchance to wear a 'dementia empathy
OL,10,Fsuit' that recreates some of the

OL,12,Fexperienced most commonly as a result
OL,13,Fof the brain damage that is caused by
OL,14,Fthe disease.
OL,16,FThe suit features weights, headphones
OL,17,Fand tunnel vision glasses - features
OL,18,Fdesigned to make wearers feel tired,
OL,19,Fbothered by tinnitus, and unable to
