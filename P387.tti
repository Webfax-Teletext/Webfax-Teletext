OL,13,Fmoped, but the officer argued that the
OL,14,F16-year-old drove into him, so Le

OL,3,CServing Guernsey police officer found
OL,4,Cguilty of assaulting teenager
OL,6,FIn court, he claimed that as his
OL,7,Fneighbours and the public know him as
OL,8,Fa police officer, there was an
OL,9,Fexpectation for him to act in
OL,10,Fsituations like this, despite being
OL,11,Foff-duty.
OL,13,FIn response, the prosecution
OL,14,Fsuccessfully argued that Le Galloudec
OL,15,Fcould have taken a picture of the
OL,16,Fmoped's licence plate, instead of
OL,17,Fstanding in front of a moving vehicle
OL,18,Fand grabbing the boy, and since there
OL,19,Fwere no grounds for arrest when he
OL,20,Frestrained the teenager to the floor,
OL,21,Fthis qualified as assault.
