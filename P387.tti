OL,11,FThe claim was made against Chief of

OL,13,Fand is believed to relate to sworn

OL,17,FAlthough it is not yet clear which

OL,6,FThe President of Home Affairs, Deputy
OL,7,FRob Prow, has reassured the public
OL,8,Fthat it is standard procedure when a
OL,9,Fcomplaint is made against a senior
OL,10,Fofficer, adding it "does not in any
OL,11,Fway imply that the officer has
OL,12,Fcommitted any disciplinary or criminal
OL,13,Fmisconduct".
OL,15,FThe investigation will examine whether
OL,16,Fperjury has been committed, which is
OL,17,Fdefined as wilfully telling a lie or
OL,18,Fdeliberately misrepresenting the truth
OL,19,Funder oath.

OL,6,FHe explains: "That associated

OL,8,Fthat it appeared 'frivolous, vexatious

OL,16,F"However, we wanted to raise this to
