OL,6,FJersey's Chief of Police says
OL,7,Fcriminalising children is not the
OL,8,Fanswer when it comes to tackling youth
OL,9,Fcrime, despite a rise in offences.
OL,11,FIt comes as the Government revealed
OL,12,Fthe Youth Justice Roadmap, which lays
OL,13,Fout a new prevention plan and an
OL,14,Fapproach for when children commit a
OL,15,Fcrime, focusing on their rights and
OL,16,Ffuture rather than just punishment.

OL,6,FOn whether he agrees with the focus on
OL,7,Fkeeping children out of prison where
OL,8,Fpossible, Robin Smith explains:
OL,9,F"Wholeheartedly ... what police
OL,10,Fofficers want more than anything is
OL,11,Fnot to be arresting young people and
OL,12,Fnot putting them before the courts.
OL,14,F"We had about 800 crimes committed by
OL,15,Fpeople under the age of 18 in 2024, a
OL,16,F13% increase (on 2023).
OL,18,F"About 280 of those crimes are by a
OL,19,Fvery small group, around 10 young
OL,20,Fpeople committing repeated crimes.
