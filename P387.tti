OL,12,FDr Dean Patterson says he is not an

OL,14,Fabout possible side effects from the

OL,6,FIn the year of the Covid pandemic but
OL,7,Fbefore the vaccine, there were five
OL,8,Fcases of Myocarditis in Guernsey,
OL,9,Fwhich is inflammation of the heart.
OL,11,FIn 2021, the year of the rollout,
OL,12,Fthese figures increased to 25 and in
OL,13,F2022, cases remained higher at 22.
OL,15,FHowever, in 2023, when fewer vaccines
