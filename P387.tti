OL,11,FShe believes these specific ants can
OL,12,Fonly be found in Guernsey and are
OL,13,Fextinct in the UK.
OL,15,FJulie added: "The ants do like to nest
OL,16,Fright on the side of the path so to
OL,17,Fkeep them safe we mark them out."
OL,19,FOne of these nests can be home to more
