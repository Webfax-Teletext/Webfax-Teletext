OL,7,FAll districts of Cumbria have a higher
OL,8,Fproportion of households living in
OL,9,Ffuel poverty than the national average.
OL,11,FThat's according to the Cumbria
OL,12,FCommunity Foundation, which believes
OL,13,Fmore than 14,300 households are
OL,14,Fsuffering.
OL,16,FAnd as the cost of living increases
OL,17,Fand energy bills rise, more and more
OL,18,Ffamilies are finding themselves in
OL,19,Fhard situations, often choosing
OL,20,Fbetween heating their homes and
OL,21,Fputting food on the table.

OL,7,FTara Edwards from Citizens Advice
OL,8,FBureau in Allerdale says there are
OL,9,Fseveral reasons for this: "There are

OL,11,Fharder to heat, that kind of fuel is
OL,12,Fmore expensive, there are often people
