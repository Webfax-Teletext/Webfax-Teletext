OL,6,FLydia Hulme is a guide dog user. After
OL,7,Fthe death of her first service dog,
OL,8,Fshe was left using a walking cane
OL,9,Funtil she was paired with her black
OL,10,FLabrador, Webster.
OL,12,FLydia told ITV Border her guide dog
OL,13,Fgives her not only a sense of
OL,14,Findependence, but also helps her
OL,15,Fovercome feelings of isolation.
OL,17,FShe said: "You feel really noticeable
OL,18,Fwhen you've got a cane. People are
OL,19,Fmore avoidant of you... it can feel
OL,20,Freally isolating when you've got a
OL,21,Fcane.

OL,7,Fare like, 'ooh, that's a nice dog!'"
OL,9,FLydia has also found that for her a

OL,11,Fwhite cane.
OL,13,F"It's being able to do things so much
OL,14,Fmore easily than with a white cane.
OL,15,FLots of people do choose a white
