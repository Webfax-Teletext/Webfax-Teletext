OL,6,FDefence solicitor David Wales,
OL,7,Fmitigating, said Heaney had suffered
OL,8,Ffrom very poor mental health
OL,9,Fthroughout his life. The offences had
OL,10,Farisen as he self-medicated with
OL,11,Falcohol and illicit substances to try
OL,12,Fand "numb" his difficulties.
OL,14,FThe sentencing judge, Recorder Mark
OL,15,FAinsworth, said it was unclear whether
OL,16,Fthe object had been lit before being
OL,17,Fthrown at the house. But of Heaney's
OL,18,F"deliberate" plan, he said: "It is
OL,19,Falmost chilling. 'This is what I'm
OL,20,Fgoing to do' - then he goes and he
OL,21,Fdoes it."

OL,6,F"Thankfully there was no fire that

OL,8,F"But the outcome of this could have
