OL,6,FManager Andy Blake said: "Last Friday
OL,7,Fgot to a point where we actually had
OL,8,Fno donations at all. In our store, all
OL,9,Fstock we had was on the shop floor. So
OL,10,Fwhen it was sold, we had nothing to
OL,11,Freplenish it.
OL,13,F"What we found is that people are
OL,14,Fkeeping clothes longer, so when they
OL,15,Fhave been donated, the quality hasn't
OL,16,Fbeen as good.
OL,18,F"So we're finding things a bit more
OL,19,Fstretched or stained or holes in them
OL,20,Fso that we can't then sell them.
