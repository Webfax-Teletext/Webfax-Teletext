OL,15,Fdeath" on Wednesday before the fair
OL,16,Fofficially begun.

OL,6,FRSPCA Chief Inspector Rob Melloy said:
OL,7,F"There are a lot of wonderful people
OL,8,Fand animals at the fair, who it's
OL,9,Freally enjoyable to meet and get to
OL,10,Fknow. You only need look at the
OL,11,FAppleby Horse Project's Best at
OL,12,FAppleby Awards, which celebrate horse
OL,13,Fhealth, happiness and horsemanship.
OL,15,F"Unfortunately, there is also an
OL,16,Felement of people who think it's okay
OL,17,Fto drive horses to the point of
OL,18,Fexhaustion, and disappointingly we've
OL,19,Fseen the most serious results of that
OL,20,Fthis week.

OL,6,F"Everyone knows about the horse who
OL,7,Fdied at Jubilee Bridge on Wednesday,
OL,8,Fbut we had a Shetland pony who died in
OL,9,Fthe residential section at the back of
OL,10,Fthe Trade Field on Saturday too, which
OL,11,Fshowed all the signs of exhaustion.
OL,13,F"We believe a lot of overworking was
OL,14,Fhappening at night, though it was not
OL,15,Fbeing reported, and we had to deal
OL,16,Fwith the consequences the day after.
OL,17,FIn the case of the Shetland, we were
OL,18,Fcalled to the stallion early in the
OL,19,Fmorning, and suspect he was overworked
OL,20,Fin the evening.
