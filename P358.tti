OL,14,FAs part of the changes, ITV marketing

OL,5,FITV 1 branding was first used in August
OL,6,F2001 and was dropped in January 2013
OL,7,Fbecause ITV chiefs decided they wanted
OL,8,Fto align the name of the company with
OL,9,Fits main TV channel.
OL,11,FIn 2022, ITV feels that having the
OL,12,Fmasterbrand (main ITV logo) also used
OL,13,Fas the logo of the main TV channel has
OL,14,Fkept ITV feeling like a linear-only
OL,15,Foffering.

OL,5,FMarketing heads believe that navigation
OL,6,Fis less clear when "ITV" is both a
OL,7,Fchannel and a masterbrand. For example,
OL,8,Fwhen "ITV" appears on a programme trail
OL,9,Fendboard  is this the channel ITV
OL,10,Ftelling me to watch this show or is it
OL,11,Fthe brand ITV endorsing the drama.
OL,13,FMasterbrand initiatives such as ITV
OL,14,FBritain Get Talking are mistakenly
OL,15,Fassociated with ITV the channel. Is
OL,16,Fthis ITV telling me there's something
OL,17,Fto watch on the ITV channel or is this
OL,18,FITV telling me this is something it
OL,19,Fstands for?

OL,5,FIt was also felt that some of the
OL,6,Fcolour changes applied to the
OL,7,Fmasterbrand since it was introduced in
OL,8,F2013 caused further confusion, in terms
OL,9,Fof the distinction between it and the
OL,10,Flogo of the main TV channel.
OL,12,FITV 1 branding will more clearly
OL,13,Fdistinguish the main broadcast channel
OL,14,Ffrom the ITV masterbrand.
