OL,7,FResidents in central Carlisle are
OL,8,Fobjecting to plans to build a new
OL,9,Fgarage and cafe on Warwick Road.
OL,11,FThe proposal would see further
OL,12,Fdevelopment near the existing Lidl
OL,13,Fstore, on one of the city's busiest
OL,14,Farterial routes.
OL,16,FObjectors say that the plans would add
OL,17,Ffurther pressure to a road that
OL,18,Falready sees heavy traffic and that
OL,19,Fbuilding on a flood plain would be
OL,20,Funwise.
