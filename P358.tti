OL,8,Fthe Carlisle United boss
OL,10,FThe demise of Mike Williamson as
OL,11,FCarlisle United head coach could have
OL,12,Fbeen easily foreseen by anyone in the
OL,13,Fcrowd on Saturday.
OL,15,FThe biggest surprise for many

OL,17,Fmuch time and as much money to spend
OL,18,Fas he was.

OL,4,C- What's next for Carlisle United?
OL,6,FThere is a certain feeling around a
OL,7,Fclub when the man running the show
OL,8,Fbecomes a dead man walking and it's
OL,9,Fbeen in the air at Brunton Park for
OL,10,Fquite some time.
OL,12,FThe Piataks have spent generously in
OL,13,Fpursuit of success but whether they
OL,14,Fhave spent wisely is a different
OL,15,Fmatter. It also feels legitimate to
OL,16,Fquestion the wisdom of giving
OL,17,Fsuccessive bosses funds to buy big in
OL,18,Fa transfer window only to jettison
OL,19,Fthem before letting them assemble the
OL,20,Fkit they have created.

OL,6,FI'm not for one moment suggesting the

OL,6,FThe owners have noble ideas about

OL,9,FThey may have to hold their noses and
