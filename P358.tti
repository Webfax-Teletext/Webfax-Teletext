OL,6,FFor fifty years Paul Salveson has been
OL,7,Fcollecting books about trains - how
OL,8,Fthey work, what they do, and the ways
OL,9,Fin which they've contributed to social
OL,10,Fand cultural history.
OL,12,FNow, it's a passion, and a collection
OL,13,Fhe's able to share with the world. His
OL,14,Fbooks are the centrepiece of a new
OL,15,Flibrary he's opened in his own home,
OL,16,Fat Kents Bank Station near Grange-over-
OL,17,FSands. It could be the only one of its
OL,18,Fkind in the UK.

OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV News, Paul said he
OL,7,Fwanted his collection to be
OL,8,F"accessible" to all.
OL,10,F"Rather than just have them here for
OL,11,Fme, very occasionally, to look at - if
OL,12,Fever in some cases," he said.
OL,14,F"Just throw it open to people, so
OL,15,Fpeople can come and use it."

OL,6,FA childhood love for the railways
OL,7,Fsparked a career on the tracks - Paul
OL,8,Fexplained his first job was as a train
OL,9,Fguard, and throughout his career he
OL,10,Fwas keen to share his passion, and
OL,11,Fknowledge, with both colleagues and
OL,12,Fpassengers.
OL,14,F"The history of railways," he
OL,15,Fexplained, is "not just the engines,
OL,16,Fas much as we all love steam, but also
OL,17,Fthe social history, the contribution
OL,18,Fthat railways have made to the world
OL,19,Fthat we're in today."

OL,6,FIt's not just the books that are the
OL,7,Fattraction either. The library is
OL,8,Fhoused in Paul's home - a house was
OL,9,Ffirst opened in 1865 and was extended
OL,10,Fin 1890 for the former station master
OL,11,Fof the tiny Kents Bank Station near
OL,12,FGrange, on the Furness Line.
OL,14,F"I think there was pressure locally to
OL,15,Fbuild a proper station," Paul said.
OL,17,F"In the end, the Furness Railway
OL,18,Fdecided to build the proper station
OL,19,Fbuilding, which is this, and so the
OL,20,Fstation master and his family lived
OL,21,Fhere."
