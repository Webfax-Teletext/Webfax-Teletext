OL,6,GOn its 40th birthday, Channel 4 has
OL,7,Gaired a new ident, featuring what
OL,8,Gappears to be the original version of
OL,9,Gits iconic '4' logo.
OL,11,FIn 2018, the '4' logo underwent a minor
OL,12,Fmodification, with the introduction of
OL,13,Fadditional spacing between the blocks.
OL,15,FThe new ident features a white version
OL,16,Fof the '4' logo animating and moving
OL,17,Fabout in the foreground. The background
OL,18,Fanimates through a range of colours
OL,19,Fthat appear to be a nod to the colour
OL,20,Fscheme of the original 1982 logo.

OL,6,FIt's unclear if the new ident is
OL,7,Frelated to the birthday celebrations or
OL,8,Fif it's a more permanent addition to
OL,9,Fthe standard ident set.
OL,11,FOr, is it perhaps part of transitional

OL,13,Fnew branding strategy?

OL,12,FIt's unclear what exactly this means.
