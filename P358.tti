OL,6,FITV Border reporter Isla Todd spoke to

OL,8,Fthe infected blood scandal has had on
OL,9,Ftheir lives
OL,11,FThe father of a man who died of HIV
OL,12,Fdue to the infected blood scandal

OL,6,FHis son Bob Strachan told ITV Border:
OL,7,F"My dad didn't hug myself or even kiss
OL,8,Fmy mum because he didn't know how this
OL,9,Fwas passed on.
OL,11,F"My mum had told me that he died of
OL,12,Fkidney failure. And that was what I
OL,13,Fbelieved until my teens."
OL,15,FBob said his mother then sat him down
OL,16,Fand told him the real story.

OL,3,C'My dad didn't hug myself or kiss my

OL,6,FThe family were so affected by the
OL,7,Fstigma of HIV, at a time when little
OL,8,Fwas known about the infection, that
OL,9,Fthey moved from Peterhead to New
OL,10,FZealand, then Canada, before returning
OL,11,Fto Scotland.
OL,13,F"There was a lot of ignorance around
OL,14,Fit (HIV), so it's just really hard to
OL,15,Fthink about, something that was life
OL,16,Fchanging and life ending, not just for
OL,17,Fthat person, but for everyone around
OL,18,Fthem," Bob said.
