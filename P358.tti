OL,7,FThe mother of a teenager who died in a
OL,8,Fcar crash has said the government's
OL,9,Fnew road safety strategy "needs to go
OL,10,Ffurther".
OL,12,FSharron Huddleston's daughter Caitlin
OL,13,Fdied in 2017, aged just 18. The driver
OL,14,Fof the car, Caitlin's friend, also
OL,15,Fdied in the accident, while the rear
OL,16,Fpassenger was seriously injured.
OL,18,FSince then, Sharron has campaigned for
OL,19,Fthe implementation of restrictions on
OL,20,Fnewly-qualified young drivers.

OL,15,F"A graduated driving licence is law in
