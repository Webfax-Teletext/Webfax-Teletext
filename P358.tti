OL,6,FTwelve months ago, John Swinney told a
OL,7,Fsoul searching private meeting at the
OL,8,FSNP's annual conference that the party
OL,9,Fhad lost Scotland's middle class.
OL,11,FIn the members-only gathering, the
OL,12,Ffirst minister warned those who
OL,13,Fremained faithful that the time for
OL,14,Flicking wounds was over and that
OL,15,Fwithout change they were heading for
OL,16,Fdisaster.

OL,6,F"We've got to work to create a
OL,7,Fpurposeful and united party," he said
OL,8,Fin front of private polling which
OL,9,Foutlined exactly why and how Labour
OL,10,Fhad swept the board north of the
OL,11,Fborder in that summer's general
OL,12,Felection.
OL,14,F"I will say this in this session ` I

OL,16,Fgot to be more cohesive. If we are not
OL,17,Fmore cohesive then I think you can all

OL,20,FThe message was stark and the entire
OL,21,Fevent was about regrouping for the SNP.
