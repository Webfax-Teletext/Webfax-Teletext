OL,6,FThe Scottish Government has launched a
OL,7,Fconsultation on plans to fit all
OL,8,Fnewborn calves with Electronic
OL,9,Fidentification (eID) tags.
OL,11,FThe proposals aim to modernise how
OL,12,FScotland's cattle are tagged,
OL,13,Fidentified and traced.
OL,15,FFarmers and businesses are being
OL,16,Fencouraged to fit all new-born calves
OL,17,Fwith electronic ear-tags.
OL,19,FThe tags should allow cattle keepers
OL,20,Fto collect and store information in
OL,21,Ftheir cattle more accurately.

OL,12,FRobert Neill, a cattle farmer on Upper
OL,13,FNesbit Farm, just outside Jedburgh,
OL,14,Fhas been using electric tags to keep

OL,17,F"So low frequency was initially what
OL,18,Fwe started with here, but the, problem
