OL,6,F"He showed that he had enough to be
OL,7,Finvolved in first team training so
OL,8,Fhe's trained with us on numerous
OL,9,Foccasions. I just think there is
OL,10,Fsomething there that is worth looking
OL,11,Fat and keeping around for longer while
OL,12,Fwe try to develop him.
OL,14,FSimpson added that he's not quite

OL,16,Fbut it looks as though he's "got real
OL,17,Fpromise."

OL,6,F"He's got experience with some big

OL,9,F"Also, it sounds like a bit of a soft
OL,10,Fthing to say, but I think the lad
OL,11,Fdeserves a chance with what him and
OL,12,Fhis family have been going through.
OL,14,F"We're going to give him an
OL,15,Fopportunity to see what he can do.
OL,16,FIt's been really frustrating so far
OL,17,Fbecause he hasn't been able to play,
OL,18,Fbut we're now in a position where we
OL,19,Fcan play him as an overaged player in
OL,20,Fyouth team games and he can also play
OL,21,Fin the Cumberland Cup games.
