OL,6,FThe Scottish Government are already

OL,11,FDumfries and Galloway Council have

OL,9,FConservative Mike Starkie told us:
OL,10,F"Cumbria will not have a tourist tax
OL,11,Fif I am elected mayor."
OL,13,FHe said that's because it would

OL,16,Fprove counterproductive for jobs and
OL,17,Fthe Cumbrian economy."
