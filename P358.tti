OL,6,GThe 40th anniversary of BBC breakfast
OL,7,GTV was celebrated beautifully. From a
OL,8,Gdesign fan's point of view, there was
OL,9,Gmuch to enjoy.
OL,11,FBringing back the old analogue clock
OL,12,Ffor the morning was a lovely touch. The
OL,13,Fmodern take on the original Breakfast
OL,14,FTime astons was beautifully stylish.
OL,16,FBut there is also a story of how the
OL,17,FBBC finally came to find the right
OL,18,Fformat for breakfast TV after a long
OL,19,Fjourney.
OL,21,FBreakfast Time was an immediate success

OL,6,FBut once TV-am plunged downmarket and
OL,7,Fsaved itself from disaster, Breakfast
OL,8,FTime started to seem unloved from
OL,9,Fabove.
OL,11,FIt could not compete with its
OL,12,Fdownmarket rival ` nor was it a hard
OL,13,Fnews programme which played to the
OL,14,FBBC's strengths.
OL,16,FYet it was valued, even loved, by its
OL,17,Faudience. Warm and friendly, the
OL,18,Fregular presenters were like extended
OL,19,Ffamily to loyal viewers.

OL,6,FWhen Breakfast Time was relaunched as a
OL,7,Fnews-driven programme in November 1986,
OL,8,Fthe move was controversial.
OL,10,FIt made strategic sense. A clear choice
OL,11,Ffor morning viewers which also gave the
OL,12,Fprogramme a clearer purpose while the
OL,13,Fnew daytime schedule catered for those
OL,14,Fwho wanted the soft features, cookery,
OL,15,Ffashion and chat.
OL,17,FBut the audience clearly took a while
OL,18,Fto get used to a radically different
OL,19,Fprogramme. The atmosphere was very
OL,20,Fdifferent ` sometimes even sterile `
OL,21,Fand many regular presenters and
OL,22,Fcontributors were dropped.

OL,6,FThis relaunch is sometimes forgotten
OL,7,Fnow as the name remained.
OL,9,FWhatever happened behind-the-scenes,
OL,10,Fthe subsequent changes into BBC
OL,11,FBreakfast News in 1989 and Breakfast in
OL,12,Fits modern form in 2000 seemed
OL,13,Fevolutionary from the viewer's
OL,14,Fperspective. There was no great
OL,15,Fcontroversy on either occasion.
OL,17,FAfter 2000 the atmosphere gradually got
OL,18,Fwarmer and that old friendly atmosphere
OL,19,Fwas restored.

OL,6,FBut that friendliness and closeness to
OL,7,Fits audience is a tribute to the
OL,8,Foriginal Breakfast Time.
OL,10,FPerhaps the proof the pioneers got the
OL,11,Fbasic style of presentation right came
OL,12,F20 years ago when Breakfast overtook
OL,13,FGMTV in the ratings.
