OL,6,GI've often criticised Channel 4 but
OL,7,Gas many will have realised it's tough
OL,8,Glove.
OL,10,FThe remnants of the C4 of old can
OL,11,Fstill shine even when so much of the
OL,12,Fmodern channel is predictable,
OL,13,Fprovocative in a bad way or puerile.
OL,15,FAnd so it's with real pleasure I
OL,16,Foffer praise where praise is due.

OL,6,FVisually they are a treat and their

OL,10,FThe C4 logo is bold and proud. It's a

OL,6,FAlthough cleverly executed, they
OL,7,Flacked depth and authority. They
OL,8,Fseemed lightweight and

OL,11,FLike much of modern C4 they seemed
