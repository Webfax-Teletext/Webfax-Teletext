OL,6,FTosh MacDonald, Pipe Major from the
OL,7,FJedburgh Pipe Band: "Going with the
OL,8,Fveterans on the boat and playing out
OL,9,Fthe harbour from Portsmouth with the
OL,10,Fnaval boats beside us giving us an
OL,11,Fescort was an amazing experience."
OL,13,FSome of the younger members of the
OL,14,Fpipe band who were in attendance were
OL,15,Fleft speechless meeting the veterans.
OL,17,FTosh MacDonald added: "They were kind
OL,18,Fof starstruck a lot of them. We had a
OL,19,Fcouple that had never been before and
OL,20,Fthey were just in awe of the old boys
OL,21,Fand girls.
