OL,6,FThe proposed by-law would be the first
OL,7,Fof its kind in Scotland, banning the
OL,8,Ffeeding of gulls.
OL,10,FThe Scottish Government last year held
OL,11,Fa summit to tackle the problem of
OL,12,Fdisruptive gulls in Scotland, which
OL,13,Fresulted in a #100,000 fund for

OL,16,FCllr Anderson said: "Right now, the
OL,17,Fcouncil has no enforcement powers to
OL,18,Fstop deliberate feeding. Education
OL,19,Falone has not worked.

OL,12,FThe by-law would allow council
