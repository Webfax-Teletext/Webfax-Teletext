OL,6,FThe Church of Scotland is at the
OL,7,Fcentre of a disagreement over the
OL,8,Fproposed closure of Southwick Church.
OL,10,FIn a controversial move, its appeal
OL,11,Fcommittee ruled the well-used building
OL,12,Fwill shut in 2027.
OL,14,FLocal minister Reverend John Murdoch
OL,15,Fand the congregation had asked for a
OL,16,Frethink but their case was rejected.
OL,18,FThe move followed a decision by the
OL,19,FGeneral Assembly to cut the number of
OL,20,Fchurches across the country.
