OL,6,FBut yet again ITV 1's scheduling of
OL,7,FNews at Ten is undermining what should

OL,10,FNews at Ten was brought back in 2008 `
OL,11,Finitially from Mondays to Thursdays but
OL,12,Fsoon afterwards the programme started
OL,13,Fto appear on Fridays too.
OL,15,FThe move was instigated by Michael

OL,6,FThe revival never regained the
OL,7,Faudiences of old ` and there is an
OL,8,Fargument that it isn't helpful to have
OL,9,Fthe news on both major channels
OL,10,Fsimultaneously ` but it was broadly
OL,11,Fwelcomed by journalists and others who
OL,12,Frealise the vital role high quality

OL,14,Fdemocratic society.
OL,16,FThe scheduling was never fixed and ITV

OL,6,FBut in recent months there have been
OL,7,Fmore occasions when News at When has
OL,8,Freturned. There has scarcely been a
OL,9,Fweek for some time when the programme
OL,10,Fhas been shown at 10pm each night.
OL,12,FSometimes this has been because of
OL,13,Ffootball ` though it should be noted
OL,14,Fthat the BBC usually manages to get to
OL,15,Fthe news on time unless the game goes
OL,16,Fto extra time.
OL,18,FSometimes though this is because the
OL,19,F9pm programme is longer than usual. A
OL,20,Fdeliberate decision was taken to
OL,21,Fcommission or schedule a programme
OL,22,Fwhich wasn't made for a 60-minute slot.

OL,13,FA repeat of Midsomer Murders pushed

OL,15,Fthing will happen this Friday. As far
OL,16,Fas I can recall, it was the first time
OL,17,Fsince 2004 when a routine scheduling
