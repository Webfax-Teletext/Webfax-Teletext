OL,5,GOn its 40th birthday, Channel 4 has
OL,6,Gaired a new ident, featuring what
OL,7,Gappears to be the original version of
OL,8,Gits iconic '4' logo.
OL,10,FIn 2018, the '4' logo underwent a minor
OL,11,Fmodification, with the introduction of
OL,12,Fadditional spacing between the blocks.
OL,14,FThe new ident features a white version
OL,15,Fof the '4' logo animating and moving
OL,16,Fabout in the foreground. The background
OL,17,Fanimates through a range of colours
OL,18,Fthat appear to be a nod to the colour
OL,19,Fscheme of the original 1982 logo.

OL,5,FIt's unclear if the new ident is
OL,6,Frelated to the birthday celebrations or
OL,7,Fif it's a more permanent addition to
OL,8,Fthe standard ident set.
OL,10,FOr, is it perhaps part of transitional

OL,12,Fnew branding strategy?

OL,11,FIt's unclear what exactly this means.
OL,12,FIn the immediate aftermath of the
