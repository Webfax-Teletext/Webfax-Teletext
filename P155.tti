OL,6,GWith the nights drawing in and the

OL,8,Glast week saw some interesting ratings.
OL,10,FThe BBC regional news at 6.30pm had
OL,11,Fmore than 4 million viewers on four
OL,12,Fnights out of five.
OL,14,FThe BBC News at Six came within
OL,15,Ftouching distance of 4m on three
OL,16,Fnights and hit 4m on Thursday.
OL,18,FThanks to this, The One Show seemed to
OL,19,Fbenefit too, reaching 3m viewers twice
OL,20,Fand getting more viewers than the
OL,21,Fsecond half of the ITV Evening News.
