OL,6,GDoes it matter who reads the news? It
OL,7,Gmay seem like a stupid question. News
OL,8,Gpresenters are not personalities. As

OL,11,Gshould it matter?
OL,13,FThe truth is it does.

OL,10,FSo, having said why presenters matter

OL,6,FWhen the BBC overhauled news
OL,7,Fprogrammes in 1999, the rota was
OL,8,Fsimple.
OL,10,
OL,11,F Anna Ford usually presented the One
OL,12,Fwith Darren Jordan usually covering on
OL,13,Fother days.
OL,14,F Huw Edwards was the face of the Six
OL,15,Fwith Fiona Bruce in the chair on
OL,16,FFridays.
OL,17,F Peter Sissons and Michael Buerk
OL,18,Fcontinued as the presenters of the

OL,6,FThese changes were also a reminder
OL,7,Fthat presenting is a precarious
OL,8,Foccupation. Martyn Lewis left and a
OL,9,Fnumber of others either returned to
OL,10,Freporting or stopped presenting
OL,11,Fregularly.
OL,13,FI'd suggest the following rota.
OL,15,FThe One and the Six should share the
OL,16,Fsame presenter. There should be only
OL,17,Ftwo people allowed to front the
OL,18,Fprogramme regularly.
OL,20,FTwo presenters should be devoted to
OL,21,Fthe Ten, taking it in turns to present
OL,22,Facross the whole week.

OL,6,FThe weekend lunchtime and early

OL,8,Fdedicated presenter.
OL,10,FThis would mean a smaller team of
OL,11,Ffamiliar faces and would also allow
OL,12,Fthe Ten to maintain a degree of a

OL,15,FThere would, inevitably, be difficult
