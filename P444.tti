OL,8,Fsolicitor representing the Donaldson
OL,9,Ffamily, Mr O'Loan said the allegation
OL,10,Fagainst Mr Adams was not raised.
OL,12,FHe said the response of the family
OL,13,Fwould have been valuable to the

OL,15,Ffor additional background that was not

OL,21,F"lack of good journalistic judgement".
