OL,6,FThe agriculture minister says a change
OL,7,Fto inheritance tax for farms, which
OL,8,Fhas left farmers across the UK worried
OL,9,Ffor their future, will have a

OL,13,FUnder plans announced in the Budget,
OL,14,Finheritance tax will be charged at 20%
OL,15,Fon farms worth more than #1m, although
OL,16,Fthe Chancellor has said that in some

OL,18,Fbe about #3m.

OL,6,FThe move has caused a considerable

OL,12,FThe National Farmers Union is urging
