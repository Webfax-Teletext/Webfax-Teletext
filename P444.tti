OL,6,FResponding for the defence on

OL,8,Fthere was a "complete cloud of
OL,9,Funcertainty" around the process of how
OL,10,Fthe statements to the RMP were taken.
OL,12,FQuestioning whether G and H had
OL,13,Fcolluded, he said the RMP statements
OL,14,Fwere a "series of unreliable,
OL,15,Ffundamentally flawed, inconsistent
OL,16,Fallegations" from 50 years ago, and
OL,17,Fclaimed they may have been "seeking to
OL,18,Fjustify" their own use of force.
