OL,6,FThere have been fresh calls for a
OL,7,Fpublic inquiry into cervical cancer
OL,8,Fscreening across Northern Ireland.
OL,10,FEarlier this week, UTV brought you the
OL,11,Fstory of a woman from Co Armagh, who
OL,12,Fhas advanced-stage cervical cancer -
OL,13,Fwho revealed how three of her smear
OL,14,Ftests over almost a decade were all
OL,15,Fmisread.JNow, more women have
OL,16,Fcontacted UTV from the Western Trust
OL,17,Farea saying they developed cancer
OL,18,Fafter screeners failed to pick up
OL,19,Fabnormalities.

OL,6,FOne cancer survivor told UTV: "Thank
OL,7,FGod I was able to get treatment, but
OL,8,Fthere are women who have passed that
OL,9,Fstage and they can't.
OL,11,F"I suppose I spent a while very angry
OL,12,Fand very upset. This could have been
OL,13,Favoided. I spoke to ladies that have
OL,14,Fgone from Stage 1A up to Stage 3,
OL,15,FStage 4 and terminal, there's loads of
OL,16,Fwomen dying over this."
OL,18,FAnother lady in the Western Trust area
OL,19,Ftold UTV abnormalities were missed
OL,20,Ftwice before her cancer was detected
OL,21,Fthree years later.
