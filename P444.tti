OL,8,FUK's armed forces for the protection
OL,9,Fof its seas and under sea cables.

OL,6,FMr Varadkar was challenged that
OL,7,FIreland was in reality reliant on the
OL,8,FUK's armed forces in the protection of
OL,9,Fthe seas and the protection of
OL,10,Fundersea cables.
OL,12,FHe responded: "In relation to
OL,13,Fprotecting our seas, we have our own
OL,14,Fnavy, it's not as strong as it needs
OL,15,Fto be, and we've entered into
OL,16,Fagreements with Pesco and Nato's
OL,17,FPartnership for Peace which
OL,18,Fparticularly relate to the cables that
OL,19,Fare around the island which are

OL,6,FMr Varadkar responded saying: "You're
OL,7,Fsaying in a hypothetical scenario this

OL,10,Fof my knowledge it has never occurred,
