OL,5,FHuman remains believed to be over
OL,6,F2,000 years old have been uncovered in
OL,7,Fa bog in Co Londonderry.
OL,9,FThe PSNI said the discovery was made
OL,10,Fduring excavations on peatland in
OL,11,FBellaghy last October, after the
OL,12,Fpolice archaeological team was alerted
OL,13,Fto bones on the surface.
OL,15,FThe first bones found related to a
OL,16,Flower left leg and right arm - further
OL,17,Fbones relating to the fingers,
OL,18,Ffingernails and breastbone were then
OL,19,Flocated.
