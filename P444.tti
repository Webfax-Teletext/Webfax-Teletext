OL,6,FThe leader of the DUP has criticised
OL,7,Fthe First Minister for how she
OL,8,Fresponded to the army having to pull
OL,9,Fout of a jobs fair in Londonderry
OL,10,Ffollowing opposition from nationalist

OL,13,FEarlier this week, Michelle O'Neill
OL,14,Fsaid the decision that was made was a
OL,15,Fdemocratic one by local
OL,16,Frepresentatives.
OL,18,FHowever, Gavin Robinson said: "I'd
