OL,6,FWhen questioned by the defence, the

OL,8,Fevidence connecting Lundy to the scene
OL,9,Fof the attack.
OL,11,FA defence solicitor for the accused
OL,12,Fsaid: "Police have created a narrative
OL,13,Fthat is not supported by any evidence
OL,14,Fthat this court can rely on to connect
OL,15,F(Mr Lundy) to these charges."
OL,17,FProsecution then argued that "this is
