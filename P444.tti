OL,6,FFinance Minister John O'Dowd has said
OL,7,Fhe has no doubt healthcare workers in
OL,8,FNorthern Ireland will "receive the pay
OL,9,Frises they deserve".
OL,11,FThe minister was questioned at the

OL,13,Fthe pay uplift for health workers,
OL,14,Fwhich was "promised to them" in a
OL,15,Frecommended pay increase.
OL,17,FHealth Minister Mike Nesbitt said in
OL,18,FMay that he had signed off on a pay
OL,19,Faward in line with the Pay Review Body
OL,20,F(PRB) recommendation of a 3.6% pay
