OL,6,FThey are now being showcased at the NI

OL,8,Fopportunity to "almost reach into the

OL,11,FDr James O'Neill, the museum's
OL,12,Fcollections officer, told UTV: "At the
OL,13,Ftime we contacted the military and
OL,14,Fasked, quite cheekily actually; 'After
OL,15,Fyou blow the device, could we have
OL,16,Fsome remains of the bomb?', and that's
OL,17,Fexactly what they did.

OL,6,F"You don't get a chance like this very
OL,7,Foften, so when the opportunity comes
OL,8,Fup you grab it with both hands," he
OL,9,Fadded.
OL,11,F"Now we have this piece, it's about
OL,12,Fthe size of your hand but it's a 100%
OL,13,Fconnection that you can almost reach
OL,14,Finto the past and touch these events
OL,15,Fthat have affected us so recently,"
OL,16,Fexplained Dr O'Neill.
OL,18,FThe museum also has a scaled mock-up
OL,19,Fof the bomb measuring 2.03 metres in
OL,20,Fheight.

OL,6,F"In the case of the Rivenwood bomb, it
OL,7,Fstruck the bedrock and in all
OL,8,Fpossibility the shock of that damaged
OL,9,Fthe two fuses that were set to make
OL,10,Fthe bomb detonate," said Dr O'Neill.
OL,12,F"There were almost 300kg of explosives
OL,13,Finside the bomb, so that maybe shows
OL,14,Fpeople that it wasn't a small bomb."
OL,16,FAs for the origins of the bomb, Dr
OL,17,FO'Neill said: "We are 100% sure it
OL,18,Fcame on the 1941 Easter Tuesday raid,
OL,19,Fbut which bomber dropped it or which
OL,20,Funit dropped it, we don't know."
