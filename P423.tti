OL,6,FThe tool can be used from the day of a

OL,11,FThe data is guiding medical teams on
OL,12,Fwhether a burn will heal naturally or
OL,13,Fif the patient will need an operation,
OL,14,Fusually in the form of a skin graft.
OL,16,FConsultant burn surgeon, Chris Lewis,
OL,17,Fexplained: "It's allowing us to scan
OL,18,Fburn injuries on the day they've
