OL,6,FProfessor Che Connon, from Newcastle

OL,8,Fof your body but if that's affected it
OL,9,Fhas a big consequence - losing your
OL,10,Fvision.
OL,12,F"The effect of the damage to the
OL,13,Ftissue is obviously greater in terms
OL,14,Fof how the victim lives on afterwards."
OL,16,FThe researchers at the lab at the
OL,17,FCentre for Life are offering new hope
OL,18,Fafter identifying that alkali chemical
OL,19,Fburns can lead to a stiffening of the
OL,20,Fedge of the cornea.
