OL,6,FEach morning for more than three
OL,7,Fweeks, seven Darlington nurses walked
OL,8,Finto a tribunal to give - and hear -
OL,9,Fevidence in a case that had put them
OL,10,Fin the national limelight.
OL,12,FIt was not a position the women found
OL,13,Fthemselves in regularly.
OL,15,FAs one told me later, "I usually shy
OL,16,Faway from being in the spotlight ...
OL,17,Fso it was quite nerve wracking."

OL,6,FAt the start and end of the hearing,
OL,7,Fthere were cameras, banners and

OL,9,Fcheering their support as the group of

OL,12,FAt other times, the claimants were
OL,13,Fable to enter quietly, no doubt
OL,14,Ffocused on the day, and the issues,
OL,15,Fwhich lay ahead.
OL,17,FThe women were brought together in

OL,10,Fallowed staff to use the single sex

OL,6,FA common theme though, is the desire -
OL,7,Fas they see it - to protect the safety
OL,8,Fof women in single sex spaces; not
OL,9,Fonly at their trust or within the NHS,
OL,10,Fbut in settings across the country.
OL,12,FOne told me: "I just thought it was
OL,13,Fimportant for me to stand up for
OL,14,Fwomen's rights and protect the women
OL,15,Faround me, for safety, dignity and all
OL,16,Fwomen out there."
OL,18,FThe issue arose when the women became
OL,19,Faware that a transgender colleague,
OL,20,Fcalled Rose Henderson, was using a
OL,21,Ffemale changing space.
