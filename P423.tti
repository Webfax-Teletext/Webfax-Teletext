OL,6,FTeesside Crown Court has heard
OL,7,FScarlett died after being stabbed
OL,8,Fthrough the heart on 5 July last year,
OL,9,Fwith prosecutors saying the 11cm wound
OL,10,Fwas too deep to have been caused
OL,11,Faccidentally, and the knife must have
OL,12,Fbeen "held firmly" at the time.
OL,14,FToday (20 January), Vickers told his
OL,15,Ftrial he swiped some tongs towards
OL,16,FScarlett while they were "mucking
OL,17,Fabout" and had no idea there was a
OL,18,Fknife next to them until he saw blood
OL,19,Fgushing from her pyjama top.
