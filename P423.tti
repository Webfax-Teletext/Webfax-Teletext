OL,12,FIsland, including puffins, razorbills
OL,13,Fand roseate terns.
OL,15,FThe ban means there will be more food

OL,7,FStephen Westerberg, from the RSPB,
OL,8,Fcurrently lives and works on the
OL,9,Fisland and said the ban is timely
OL,10,Fafter a difficult two years dealing
OL,11,Fwith a bird flu outbreak, which
OL,12,Fdepleted the seabird population.
OL,14,FHe told ITV Tyne Tees: "Several
OL,15,Fspecies declined last year after two
OL,16,Fyears of bird flu and black headed
OL,17,Fgulls were really badly affected last
OL,18,Fyear, so it's really important that
OL,19,Fthey have food to increase
OL,20,Fproductivity."

OL,7,FThe RSPB has been campaigning for the

OL,9,Fthere is no room for complacency with
OL,10,Fbird numbers expected to decline by as
OL,11,Fmuch as 90 per cent by 2050 due to
OL,12,Fnumerous factors.
OL,14,F"Climate change, the warming of the
OL,15,Fsea, you know, it's just a change in
OL,16,Ftheir environment, and it is leading
OL,17,Fto a decline in our seabirds," he
