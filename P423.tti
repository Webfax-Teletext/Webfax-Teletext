OL,6,FPhotographer Kieth Pattison told Jonny

OL,11,Fphotographer specialising in
OL,12,Fdocumenting arts projects in Newcastle.

OL,6,FThe miners' strike hit headlines and
OL,7,Fhit the communities dependent on the
OL,8,Fpits even harder.
OL,10,FKeith was called upon to record life
OL,11,Fon the ground, and put forward a
OL,12,Fdifferent narrative.
OL,14,F"Someone who commissioned the arts
OL,15,Fprojects had connections with the
OL,16,Funion in Easington," he told ITV Tyne
OL,17,FTees.
OL,19,F"The people in communities didn't feel

OL,6,F"So the person that I worked with
OL,7,Fthought that perhaps if some

OL,13,FKeith said he and the community bonded
OL,14,Fquickly - him becoming "their

OL,17,F"They looked after me, come thick or

OL,6,FWhile Keith captured the every day

OL,8,Fthose in Easington, he was also there
OL,9,Ffor its toughest days.
OL,11,F"A month in there was this huge push
