OL,10,FAt the time of her imprisonment,
OL,11,FNazanin was told her imprisoning was
OL,12,Fdue to an unpaid debt between Iran and

OL,15,FThe former foreign secretary Jeremy
OL,16,FHunt said Iran was linking her case
OL,17,Fand the unpaid debt in 2021 but the UK
OL,18,Fgovernment never admitted this. Prime
OL,19,FMinister Boris Johnson also said they
OL,20,Fwere "two entirely seperate issues".
