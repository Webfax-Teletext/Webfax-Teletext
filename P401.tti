OL,8,Falso took care of cameras, lighting,

OL,11,FMatthew told ITV News he took on the

OL,13,Fprove that without any support he was
OL,14,Fstill able to tell a story.
OL,16,FIt was filmed in Hackney to help the

OL,18,FMatthew added: "Hackney has it in

OL,12,F"When you're doing something on your

OL,17,F"There were a few moments when you'd
