OL,6,F"What we do is we try to tell the
OL,7,Fstory of the North East during our
OL,8,Ffour distinct historical periods here
OL,9,Fat Beamish. So there's the Georgian
OL,10,Farea, then there's the Edwardian era
OL,11,Fin 1913, then there's the town and the
OL,12,Fpit village.
OL,14,F"And then our most recent era is the
OL,15,F1950s as we move with the time."

OL,6,FRosie Nichols, keeper of social

OL,8,Fthose to help decorate one of the
OL,9,F1950s council houses with decorations
OL,10,Ftypical of the time - a centrepiece
OL,11,Fmade of dyed feathers.
OL,13,FShe said: "It's a lot smaller than
OL,14,Fwhat we have now. It's a lot more
OL,15,Fspartan."
OL,17,FMany of the decorations are donated by
OL,18,Fmembers of the public, and is also an
OL,19,Fopportunity for the museum to hear
OL,20,Ffrom people and how they celebrate
