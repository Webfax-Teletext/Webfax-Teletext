OL,6,FThe scene of a stabbed teenager's
OL,7,Fmurder is being used to deter children
OL,8,Ffrom entering a life of knife crime.
OL,10,FConnor Brown was 18 when he was
OL,11,Ffatally attacked in a Sunderland
OL,12,Falleyway in 2019. Since then his

OL,12,FConnor's mother Tanya Brown told ITV
