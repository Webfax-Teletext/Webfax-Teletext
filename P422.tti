OL,6,FMum of three, Chloe Close, has been in
OL,7,Fher rented home in Crook for nearly 5
OL,8,Fyears.
OL,10,FNot long after moving in, she noticed
OL,11,Fthe damp growing widespread across her
OL,12,Fhome.
OL,14,F"When it first started, it was on top

OL,16,Fsomeone come out and looked at it `
OL,17,Fthere was nothing else, no follow up,

OL,6,FAs Ms Close showed us around her home
OL,7,F- every single room was riddled in
OL,8,Fsome form of damp and mould.
OL,10,FIt was shocking to find that her

OL,12,Fcouldn't use his room, as it was
