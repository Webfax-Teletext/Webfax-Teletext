OL,6,FMr Hume, from Stockton, first attended
OL,7,Fthe hospital around 20 years ago when
OL,8,Fhe lost sight in one eye.
OL,10,FHe was treated for a detached retina,
OL,11,Fwhich restored his vision but returned
OL,12,Fmore recently when scar tissue grew
OL,13,Fover back over the retina at the back
OL,14,Fof his eye.
OL,16,FThe distortion caused difficulties in
OL,17,Fhis work as an artist but his sight
OL,18,Fwas fully restored following surgery
OL,19,Fby Dr Habib.
