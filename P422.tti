OL,6,FJudge Edward Bindloss said: "The
OL,7,Fmotivation was misplaced anger and
OL,8,Ffrustration and desire to teach Mr
OL,9,FHardy a lesson."
OL,11,FNewcastle Crown Court heard Mr Hardy
OL,12,Fhad a gambling problem, struggled to
OL,13,Fmanage his finances, and would borrow
OL,14,Fsmall amounts of money from friends
OL,15,Fand family, who would also help him
OL,16,Fwith food or give him a cup of tea.
OL,18,FIn the early hours of 11 November,
OL,19,FHeslop called the police and claimed
OL,20,Fshe had loaned Mr Hardy #40, on the
OL,21,Funderstanding he would pay back #60.
