OL,10,FFrom the 18th century to the 1960s,
OL,11,Fthe Fish Quay at North Shields would
OL,12,Fbe taken over by hoards of women who
OL,13,Farrived with the herring catch between
OL,14,Fearly summer and late autumn.
OL,16,FKnown as the Herring Girls, they would
OL,17,Fgut, clean and pack the fish ready for
OL,18,Fsale while the men would be out at sea.

OL,6,FThe women, who were predominantly

OL,8,Fdown the east coast, stopping at each

OL,11,FSculptor Ray Lonsdale created a statue
OL,12,Fon the quay in tribute to the work of
OL,13,Fthe Herring Girls.
OL,15,F"From what I gather, they were a very

OL,6,F"You wouldn't think it, but they

OL,13,FThe women were known for their sharp
OL,14,Fknives, and their sharp tongues, and
OL,15,Fproved that the world of fishing was
OL,16,Fnot only for men.

OL,6,F"It was very, very labour intensive
OL,7,Fand a lot of men were out fishing so
OL,8,Fthey couldn't get the people to work
OL,9,Fto process the herring," he said.
OL,11,F"It was a lot of argy bargy, you know,
OL,12,Fwomen can't do this and women can't do
OL,13,Fthat. But, they came and they had an

OL,18,FHe continued: "Some of them could go a
OL,19,Flot faster than men anyway. They could
OL,20,Fgut 50-60 herring a minute so that's
OL,21,Fpretty quick."
