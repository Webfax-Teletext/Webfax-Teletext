OL,7,Fsaid she will refuse to take XL
OL,8,Fbullies to be put down when the ban on
OL,9,Fthe breed comes into effect.
OL,11,FFrom Thursday 1 February the breed
OL,12,Fwill be illegal unless owners have
OL,13,Fapplied for an exemption certificate.
OL,15,FLast month, new rules were introduced
OL,16,Fwhich make it illegal to breed from an
OL,17,FXL bully dog, as well as sell or
OL,18,Fadvertise them, give them away or
OL,19,Fexchange them.
