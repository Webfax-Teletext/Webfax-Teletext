OL,7,Fto work together to find solutions to
OL,8,Fthe challenges facing the NHS.
OL,10,FAs the general election approaches, Dr
OL,11,FBecky Haines is calling for fewer
OL,12,F"soundbites" and more co-operation
OL,13,Fbetween political parties when it
OL,14,Fcomes to the health service.
OL,16,FShe said: "There's too many soundbites
OL,17,Fand incentive schemes whereas we need
OL,18,Fto look at the healthcare and social
OL,19,Fcare system as one and try to look to
OL,20,Fa bigger picture rather than just
OL,21,Fdoing the next political promise."
