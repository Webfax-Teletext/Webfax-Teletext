OL,12,Fyears after the world's first

OL,16,FAt its height, the works employed
OL,17,Fnearly 3,000 people but it closed in
OL,18,F1984 - ending 151 years of production.

OL,8,FIt was very much how the economy was

OL,14,FDemand fell and in 1984 the works

OL,19,F"She said, 'I can't believe it's
