OL,7,FRadio Times: "The Metropolitan Police
OL,8,Fstill needs more black and Asian
OL,9,Fofficers. More than three years ago
OL,10,FDesmond Wilcox filmed the progress of
OL,11,Fseven such recruits - three men and
OL,12,Ffour women - through training and on to
OL,13,Fthe streets. But by the end of the
OL,14,Fseries, two had quit. Since then, one
OL,15,Fmore has left the force and those still
OL,16,Fserving have learned much about
OL,17,Fprejudice that should be useful to
OL,18,Ftheir bosses. This programme provides
OL,19,Fan update on the progress of those who
OL,20,Fstayed the course, and they join those
OL,21,Fwho quit for a debate with the
OL,22,FMetropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir
OL,23,FPeter Imbert, on the force's future as
OL,24,Fa multiracial organisation."
