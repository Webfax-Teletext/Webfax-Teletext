OL,6,GThere was some good news for STV's
OL,7,Gviewers in northern Scotland last week.
OL,9,FSTV's service covering the north east
OL,10,Fof Scotland and the Highlands and
OL,11,FIslands finally went into HD on
OL,12,FFreesat.
OL,14,FThe area includes most of the former
OL,15,FGrampian Television region.
OL,17,FFinally Freesat viewers in most of the
OL,18,Fnorth of Scotland can get their
OL,19,Fversion of STV HD on 103 ` not the
OL,20,FGlasgow service further down the EPG.

OL,6,FIt was the last principal Channel 3

OL,10,Fconcerning STV's sub-opt service on
OL,11,FFreesat in Dundee, Tayside and North
OL,12,FFife. Read on...
OL,14,FSTV operates four sub-regions: Glasgow
OL,15,Fand the west, Edinburgh and the east,
OL,16,FTayside along with North Fife, and
OL,17,FAberdeen and the north.
OL,19,FEditorially there are two distinct STV

OL,21,FEdinburgh and Tayside areas during the
OL,22,F6pm programme.

OL,15,FSTV still broadcasts two SD streams on
