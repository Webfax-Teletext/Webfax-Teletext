OL,6,GHas there been a subtle change in the

OL,10,FAn observant viewer may have noticed
OL,11,Fa little trend in recent weeks.
OL,13,FThere have been a number of occasions
OL,14,Fwhen the presenter has delivered the
OL,15,Ftop story from behind the desk.
OL,17,FIt had become standard practice in
OL,18,Frecent years for the opening link to
OL,19,Fbe delivered standing ` usually at
OL,20,Fthe studio column known as the

OL,6,FThere have also been occasions in the

OL,8,Fheadlines have been delivered seated.
OL,10,FOne of the beauties of live
OL,11,Fbroadcasting is that subtle changes
OL,12,Fcan be made quickly. As far as we
OL,13,Fknow, there were no exceptional or
OL,14,Ftechnical factors to blame for the
OL,15,Fdecision to keep the presenter seated.
OL,17,FSo what do standing links achieve?
OL,19,FThere are two main ways in which
OL,20,Fstanding links can enhance a news
OL,21,Fprogramme.

OL,6,FFirstly, the presenter can interact
OL,7,Fwith the graphics ` just like a
OL,8,Freporter night. This can be more
OL,9,Fvisually engaging than simply cutting
OL,10,Fup the graphics with the presenter
OL,11,Fout of vision.
OL,13,FSecondly, these links can showcase
OL,14,Fparticularly striking or dramatic
OL,15,Fimages or photojournalism.
OL,17,FThis is not 1970. There is nothing
OL,18,Fwrong in principle with delivering
OL,19,Flinks in these ways.
OL,21,FBut it is also very important to

OL,6,FPresentation cannot simply become
OL,7,Fgimmickry and it is important not to
OL,8,Fdevelop habits too. Does the top

OL,10,Fin a particular manner or has that
