OL,9,FAnd the moment the BBC uses popularity
OL,10,Falone as a measure of success it is
OL,11,Fdoomed.
OL,13,FBut it's time for BBC marketing teams
OL,14,Fand press officers to take a lesson
OL,15,Ffrom Michael Grade in the eighties.
OL,17,FGrade cut out a headline from The Sun
OL,18,Fand pinned it to the wall. It read:
OL,19,F"If You've Got It Flaunt It."
OL,21,FAnd this is exactly what the BBC

OL,12,FOn Friday night, The Traitors won 5.5m
