OL,7,FA former Church of England priest has
OL,8,Fsaid he was brought groups of asylum
OL,9,Fseekers 'week-in, week-out' looking to
OL,10,Fconvert to Christianity.
OL,12,FThe Rev Matthew Firth, 41, a priest at
OL,13,FSt Cuthbert's in Darlington between
OL,14,F2018 and 2020, said those brought to
OL,15,Fhim then "melted away" when asked to
OL,16,Fbecome involved in the church first.
OL,18,FHe made the claims as he gave evidence
OL,19,Fto the Home Affairs Select Committee
OL,20,Fon Tuesday 12 March. The Diocese of
OL,21,FDurham has refuted his claims.

OL,11,FHe told the committee that when he
