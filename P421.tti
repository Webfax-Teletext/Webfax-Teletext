OL,7,FFor one North Yorkshire family, saving
OL,8,Flives at sea has been a way of life
OL,9,Ffor more than 140 years.
OL,11,FSeveral generations of the Harrisons
OL,12,Fhave played their part for the
OL,13,Fcommunity of Staithes as volunteers
OL,14,Ffor the Royal National Lifeboat
OL,15,FInstitution (RNLI).
OL,17,FJust north of the seaside town of
OL,18,FStaithes has a long history associated
OL,19,Fwith the sea. At the heart of that is
OL,20,Fthe Staithes and Runswick lifeboat

OL,14,Fwe've been part of that as a family
OL,15,Ffor a large part of that 200 years is
OL,16,Fvery special, and within the community
OL,17,Fof Staithes it's nice to know that
