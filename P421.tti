OL,12,FBy the time he got that cabinet role

OL,6,FThat constituency has been portioned

OL,10,FMr Holden did not put himself forward
OL,11,Fto be the Conservative candidate in
OL,12,Fany of them.
OL,14,FI asked him about that in February,

OL,12,FThen last week, with the general

OL,12,FThe old MP had also long confirmed he
