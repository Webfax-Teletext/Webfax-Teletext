OL,6,FWhere has Storm Amy come from?
OL,8,FStorm Amy is a powerful mid-Atlantic
OL,9,Fsubtropical storm containing the
OL,10,Fremains of Hurricane Humberto and will
OL,11,Fbring wet and windy weather to the
OL,12,FBritish Isles.
OL,14,FAs it tracks across north-eastwards
OL,15,Ftowards the UK and its subtropical
OL,16,Fwarm air mass passes over the
OL,17,Frelatively cooler water of the north
OL,18,FAtlantic, it will lose some of its
OL,19,Fenergy - but will remain powerful.
