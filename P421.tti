OL,6,FThe National Trust is celebrating its
OL,7,Fcentenary looking after the Farne
OL,8,FIslands today (10 August).
OL,10,FThe Trust took over ownership of the
OL,11,FIslands from the Farne Islands
OL,12,FAssociation (FIA) on 10 August 1925.
OL,13,FThe FIA continued to manage the
OL,14,Fislands until the Trust formally took
OL,15,Fover the role in 2000.
OL,17,FThe archipelago in the North Sea is
OL,18,Finternationally renowned as a
OL,19,Fsanctuary for around 200,000 seabirds
OL,20,Fwhich return to the islands each
OL,21,Fsummer to breed.
