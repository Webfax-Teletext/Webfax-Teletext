OL,7,FTo mark what would have been Katrice's

OL,10,Fartists.
OL,12,F"I was actually bowled over by the

OL,14,Fsaid. "It's so poignant to my
OL,15,Fdaughter's case. It took me back
OL,16,Fbecause it deals with 43 years of
OL,17,Fsummers and winters and it goes
OL,18,Fthrough the story.
