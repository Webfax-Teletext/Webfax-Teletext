OL,6,FLeo Pearlman, one of the Fulwell 73

OL,10,Fbillions of pounds to the UK's
OL,11,Fcreative worth.
OL,13,F"The UK creative industry needs a

OL,15,FNorth East can provide this," he said.
OL,16,F"This is not about the UK doing the

OL,18,Fneeding the North East, and needing
OL,19,Fthis studio."
