OL,12,Fhad it x-rayed and from that we worked
OL,13,Fout that it was a spearhead from the

OL,15,Fsimilar to this at South Shields and
OL,16,Fwe had that carbon dated and that was
OL,17,F180AD... This would have been a Roman

OL,13,Fbefore the Romans turned up. There was
OL,14,Flarge paved areas made, probably
OL,15,Finside buildings. We've got a hearth,
OL,16,Fwe've got lots of quern stones they
OL,17,Fused for paving, after they'd finished
OL,18,Fuse for grinding corn, and lots of
OL,19,Ffinds that were from the Roman era,
OL,20,Fwhich showed that the inhabitants were
OL,21,Fstill basically Iron Age natives, but
OL,22,Fthey were now living a partly Roman
OL,23,Flife and trading with the Romans.
