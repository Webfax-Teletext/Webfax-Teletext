OL,7,Farrested in front of her children.
OL,9,FThe Post Office clerk was taken to a
OL,10,Fpolice station, swabbed, fingerprinted
OL,11,Fand had her mugshot taken.
OL,13,FShe had reversed transactions at
OL,14,FHadston Post Office, in
OL,15,FNorthumberland, to cover up a missing
OL,16,F#1,000 that she had not stolen.
OL,18,FWhat followed was a horrific ordeal
OL,19,Ffor someone who had never been in

OL,11,F"I tried and I tried and I couldn't

OL,13,Ftold the PA news agency.
OL,15,FShe wondered if she had mistyped a
