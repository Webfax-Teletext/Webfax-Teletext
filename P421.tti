OL,7,Fin Skinningrove said: "These were the
OL,8,Fdays of Empire. Iron and steel from
OL,9,Fhere were going across the British
OL,10,FEmpire. There were railways in Africa
OL,11,Fand India. The Tyne Bridge was built
OL,12,Fwith iron and steel from here, the
OL,13,FSydney Harbour Bridge.
OL,15,F"It's not an exaggeration. There are
OL,16,Fbeams in New York with Skinningrove
OL,17,Fand Dorman Long stamped on them."
OL,19,FThe industry was born almost by

OL,6,FIn the September of 1847, Anthony Lex
OL,7,FMaynard approached Samuel Okey as he
OL,8,Fwas scouring Saltburn beach for traces
OL,9,Fof ironstone.
OL,11,FAs the two chatted, Maynard said he
OL,12,Fhad seen similar rocks on his own
OL,13,Fproperty. They agreed to look at it
OL,14,Ftogether and cut the first ironstone
OL,15,Fin Cleveland there and then.
OL,17,FOver the years that followed, a total
OL,18,Fof 83 mines sprung up across the area,
OL,19,Fdrawing workers from all corners of
OL,20,FEngland to work the land - some
OL,21,Fwalking from as far away as Cornwall.
