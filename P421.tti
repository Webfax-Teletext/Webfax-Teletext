OL,6,FMs Wallis told us that it is not just
OL,7,Ffor the work Sue has done with Dave,
OL,8,Fbut how she has helped other people in
OL,9,Fa similar situation to herself.
OL,11,FShe said: "It's all well and good
OL,12,Fhaving the hospital staff and medical
OL,13,Fprofessionals talking through that
OL,14,Fprocess, but often so much of what
OL,15,Fpeople need is just that person who's
OL,16,Flived it, who can just be gentle and
OL,17,Fsupportive and encouraging.
OL,19,F"Sue does this without even thinking
OL,20,Fabout it, she won't even consider that
OL,21,Fthat's something that she does."
