OL,6,FA Devon woman who was struck down with
OL,7,Fa neurological condition says art has
OL,8,Fbecome a therapy to help her get on
OL,9,Fwith her life.
OL,11,FKirsty-Ann Johnstone was on a barefoot
OL,12,Fcharity walk in October 2020 when she
OL,13,Fthought she was having a stroke.
OL,15,FRushed to hospital she was diagnosed
OL,16,Finstead with Functional Neurological
OL,17,FDisorder (FND), a condition which
OL,18,Fmimics the symptoms of a stroke as
OL,19,Fwell as Parkinson's and MS.

OL,6,FShe told ITV News West Country: "By
OL,7,Fthe time I got to hospital, I was
OL,8,Fstruggling to speak at all.
OL,10,F"And it affected all my left side, so
OL,11,Fit was really difficult to process
OL,12,Fwhat was happening."
OL,14,FThe FND has left Kirsty-Ann with a
OL,15,Fstutter, she has issues with mobility
OL,16,Fand agonising tremors. It has meant
OL,17,Fshe has had to give up work and lose
OL,18,Fher independence.

OL,6,FThere is no cure for the condition and
OL,7,Ftreatment is a postcode lottery.
OL,8,FKirsty-Ann has had to rely on friends
OL,9,Fand family to get her through.
OL,11,FBut she has discovered art, and is set
OL,12,Fto put on an exhibition of some of the
OL,13,F3,000 paintings she has created as
OL,14,Fpart of her own therapy.
OL,16,FShe said: "It's lovely to be able to
OL,17,Fraise awareness of FND and the
OL,18,Fimportance of the charities.
