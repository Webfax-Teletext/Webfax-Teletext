OL,6,FWhile many people live hugely
OL,7,Findependent and successful lives while
OL,8,Fhaving special educational needs -
OL,9,Fotherwise known as SEN or SEND - the
OL,10,Ffact is that others need considerable

OL,13,FFor children, they need an education

OL,16,Fbattle for parents to achieve that.

OL,9,Ffrom school because the place assigned

OL,6,FChildren with SEND will often struggle
OL,7,Fwith speech and language, their
OL,8,Fbehaviour, emotions and concentration.
OL,9,FThere are, of course, specialist
OL,10,Fschools that are designed to support
OL,11,Fchildren who are autistic, for
OL,12,Fexample, but the number of places are
OL,13,Flimited.
OL,15,FParents, therefore, have to fight the
OL,16,Fsystem. However, the system is
OL,17,Fcomplicated, full of jargon and legal
OL,18,Fcomplications and they find themselves
OL,19,Fup against local authorities who will
OL,20,Ffight them back.

OL,9,Foften win at this stage, but by then
OL,10,Fso much time has passed with the child

OL,14,FI have found the process of reporting

OL,17,Fheartbreaking when a mum tells you her
