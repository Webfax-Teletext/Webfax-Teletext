OL,6,FThe company said their ongoing efforts
OL,7,Fto build a protective wall had been
OL,8,F"significantly hampered" by the wet
OL,9,Fweather.
OL,11,F"Despite the current sunshine, we are
OL,12,Fstill seeing significant levels of
OL,13,Fwater continuing to flow from the top
OL,14,Fof the tunnel and we expect this to
OL,15,Ffurther slow our work", a spokesperson
