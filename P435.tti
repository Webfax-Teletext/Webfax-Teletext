OL,13,FThere was no jury present, and little
OL,14,Fjeopardy - Paul Butler had entered his

OL,18,Ftears from those in court.

OL,6,FProsecutor Joanne Martin KC set out
OL,7,Fthe story of the case. Claire Chick
OL,8,Fand Butler first met as neighbours,
OL,9,Fbefore marrying and living together.
OL,10,FThen came Butler's increasingly
OL,11,Ferratic and frightening behaviour.
OL,13,FWe heard that Claire had given six
OL,14,Fstatements to the police in the four
OL,15,Fmonths before her death, Butler had
OL,16,Fbeen arrested several times for
OL,17,Fstalking and repeatedly released on

OL,20,Fseriously worried he may harm her.

OL,6,FUntil today, the story of Claire's
OL,7,Fabusive relationship with the former
OL,8,Fdoorman was fragmented and incomplete.
OL,10,FButler, dressed in a white long-
OL,11,Fsleeved t-shirt and jeans, sat in the
OL,12,Fdock with his head in his hands as the
OL,13,Ffull picture was revealed.
OL,15,FHe placed a tracking device on her

OL,18,Fposted cryptic messages on Facebook,
