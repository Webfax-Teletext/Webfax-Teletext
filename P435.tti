OL,6,FEverett told ITV's Good Morning
OL,7,FBritain: "I'm part of a big rota. Our
OL,8,Fpub closed down a few months ago, and
OL,9,Fit's had a chequered existence for the
OL,10,Flast 20 years, like many pubs.
OL,12,F"It's in a rural village, and I think
OL,13,Fthe people in the village realised
OL,14,Fthat without it, there's no
OL,15,Fpossibility of communication, and so
OL,16,Fthe villagers wanted to keep the pub
OL,17,Fgoing.
OL,19,F"Everybody decided to take part in
OL,20,Frotas in various roles, and I have
OL,21,Fdone a few stints pulling pints.

OL,6,FHe added: "It's a great thing. Without
OL,7,Fa pub in a village, if you're in the
OL,8,Fcountryside and you're eight miles
OL,9,Ffrom the nearest town, it's sad, and
OL,10,Fit's such a difficult time for pubs in
OL,11,Fgeneral."
OL,13,FAsked if he has good arm action for
OL,14,Fpulling pints, Everett said: "I'm
OL,15,Fdoing pretty well so far."
OL,17,FHe added he would be back behind the
OL,18,Fbar "probably at the end of the month".
