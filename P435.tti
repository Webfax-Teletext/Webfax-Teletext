OL,6,FThe new Green Party leader has warned
OL,7,FBristol's senior Labour MPs that they
OL,8,Fcould be out at the next general
OL,9,Felection, and argued the Greens are
OL,10,Fhaving a "huge moment" with "really
OL,11,Fgood prospects" in and around the city.
OL,13,FIn an interview with ITV West Country,
OL,14,FZack Polanski said "it's time to get
OL,15,FCarla Denyer some company", and
OL,16,Fclaimed the high-profile of the Labour
OL,17,FMPs in Bristol was "even more helpful"
OL,18,Fto their campaign.

OL,6,FThe Green Party could be seen as

OL,11,Fopposition ahead of the next election.
OL,13,FLast year, Carla Denyer became the
OL,14,FSouth West's first Green MP, winning
OL,15,FBristol Central with a 57% share of
OL,16,Fthe vote. The other story was that the
OL,17,FParty came second in every other
OL,18,FBristol constituency, posing a clear
OL,19,Fchallenge for the governing party in a
OL,20,Ffew years' time.
