OL,15,FBut the first day of the fiesta has

OL,18,FCourt to enjoy a sun-filled day of

OL,10,Fballoons to fly. If there is too much

OL,13,Fthen it is unlikely balloons will be

OL,16,FThe decision on whether it's safe is
OL,17,Fmade by the fiesta's specialist flight
OL,18,Fteam and is announced in the arena
OL,19,Fwith a puff of either green smoke -
OL,20,Ffor go - or red smoke if the
