OL,11,F"The street was blocked," she said.
OL,12,F"The neighbours' cars were blocked in
OL,13,Fon both sides, I couldn't even get my

OL,15,Fhave a doctor's appointment, but I
OL,16,Fcouldn't get off.
OL,18,F"So the neighbours said 'Well we need

OL,20,Fgoing to bring our cars out so at
OL,21,Fleast then we can get out."
