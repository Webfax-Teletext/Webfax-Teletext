OL,6,FThe arguments date back more than a

OL,8,Fintervention to assess claims of

OL,6,F"The message we're getting from people
OL,7,Fin Bristol is they need a growing
OL,8,Fspace and unfortunately, the council
OL,9,Fand government aren't doing enough to
OL,10,Fprovide that right now," he added.
OL,11,FRoots don't need planning permission
OL,12,Fto operate the land, leased to them by
OL,13,Fdescendants of the Wills tobacco
OL,14,Ffamily. A Certificate of Lawful

OL,20,Fthe A369.JShe explained: "We want them
OL,21,F(Roots) to at least understand what
OL,22,Fthey're coming to, the precious nature
OL,23,Fof this landscape and the hazards on
