OL,6,FA couple from Somerset who lost

OL,8,Fwhile running a branch of the Post
OL,9,FOffice have said an apology from the

OL,13,FAndrew and Kathy Tizzard ran their

OL,15,Fusing their own money to make up for a

OL,6,FThe-then boss of the Post Office,
OL,7,FPaula Vennels, broke down in tears
OL,8,Fwhile giving evidence to an inquiry
OL,9,Finvestigating the Horizon IT scandal
OL,10,Ffor the first time on Wednesday 22 May.
OL,12,FPaula said: "I fully accept now, that
OL,13,Fthe Post Office knew that. I
OL,14,Fcompletely accept it. Personally, I
OL,15,Fdidn't know that and I'm incredibly
OL,16,Fsorry."
OL,18,FBut Mr and Mrs Tizzard criticised Ms
OL,19,FVennels apology, as "hollow" and "too
OL,20,Flittle, too late".

OL,6,F"Well to be honest with you, it's just
OL,7,Fhollow," Kathy said.
OL,9,F"We can all sit there after the event
OL,10,Fand say 'I'm sorry for this' or 'I'm
OL,11,Fsorry for that'. But in reality, I
OL,12,Fpersonally feel she knew an awful lot
OL,13,Fof what was going on.
OL,15,FAndrew added: "It's too little, too
OL,16,Flate. We need the questions answered."
OL,18,FThe pair were visited by investigators
OL,19,Fdemanding to see their accounts, as
OL,20,Fportrayed in the ITV drama Mr Bates

OL,6,FThe only way the couple could avoid
OL,7,Ffurther action was to pay back the
OL,8,Fmoney - which they were wrongly
OL,9,Faccused of taking - themselves. This
OL,10,Famounted to around #20,000 and they
OL,11,Fhave never been compensated for it.
OL,13,FAndrew recalled: "Balance nights, we
OL,14,Fwere there until two in the morning,
OL,15,Fstaring at Horizon, not understanding
OL,16,Fhow we could remove errors that we
OL,17,Fknew were not there."

OL,6,FBut for Kathy, the impact was even
OL,7,Fmore severe and she was admitted to an
OL,8,Fintensive care unit in hospital for
OL,9,Forgan failure, due to stress.
OL,11,F"My weight had dropped so much because

OL,14,F"I also remember saying to the
OL,15,Fspecialist - when he said ' I think
