OL,8,Fvictim had been out with friends in
OL,9,FTiverton. At the end of the evening,
OL,10,Fshe received a Facebook message from
OL,11,FHewitt offering her accommodation for
OL,12,Fthe night.
OL,14,FThe victim met Hewitt and they went to
OL,15,Fhis brother's house together, as she
OL,16,Fdidn't wish to disturb her mother. She
OL,17,Fwent to sleep fully clothed but was
OL,18,Fawakened by Hewitt raping her.
