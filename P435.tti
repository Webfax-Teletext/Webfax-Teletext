OL,6,FAn NHS trust has admitted that more

OL,8,Fteenager may have prevented her death.
OL,10,FCariss Stone died aged 19 in August
OL,11,F2019, two days after being found with
OL,12,Fa ligature around her neck at a

OL,6,FThe former Strode College student had

OL,12,FDr Lucy Knight, Medical Director of

OL,6,FShe had been judged to require NHS
OL,7,Fstandard Level 2 observation - which

OL,12,FThe jury heard that a nurse in charge
OL,13,Fof Holford Ward, the facility in
OL,14,FTaunton where Cariss was detained, had
OL,15,Fdecided to implement patient checks
OL,16,Fevery five minutes and had given staff

OL,6,FDr Knight said the sheets were
OL,7,F"totally unhelpful and misleading"
OL,8,Fbecause they resulted in staff filling
OL,9,Fin records that weren't true.
OL,11,FCCTV footage from the day Cariss was
OL,12,Ffound with the ligature shows that
OL,13,Fsome of her checks were up to 12

OL,16,FUnder questioning from solicitor
