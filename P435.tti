OL,6,FA dairy farmer from South
OL,7,FGloucestershire has described the rise
OL,8,Fin fly-tipping as 'a tidal wave' as
OL,9,Flocal authorities struggle to
OL,10,Fprosecute those responsible.
OL,12,FAcross the South West, fly-tipping
OL,13,Fincidents rose to nearly 50,000 last
OL,14,Fyear with only 3.5% of those leading
OL,15,Fto fines or prosecutions according to
OL,16,Fgovernment figures.
OL,18,FRichard Cornock who has farmed in
OL,19,FTytherington for forty years says the
OL,20,Fissue is getting worse, affecting his
OL,21,Fbusiness and putting livestock at risk.
