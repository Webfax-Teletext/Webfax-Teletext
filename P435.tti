OL,7,FTwo miniature rope bridges have been

OL,9,Fhelp endangered dormice travel between

OL,12,FForestry England came up with the idea
OL,13,Fbecause they had to remove diseased
OL,14,Fash trees from part of the wood at
OL,15,FFlaxley, which meant the hazel dormice
OL,16,Fcouldn't easily move from one part of
OL,17,Ftheir normal habitat to another.

OL,20,F16-foot high over a forest road and

OL,7,FArea ecologist at Forestry England,
OL,8,FKate Wollen said: "Dormice do not like
OL,9,Fto come to ground except for
OL,10,Fhibernation.
OL,12,F"They feel vulnerable to predators
OL,13,Fwhen on the ground and while these
OL,14,Fbridges do not replace the trees that
OL,15,Fhad to be felled, they will enable
OL,16,Fdormice to feel safer as they cross
OL,17,Ffrom one part of the wood to another."
