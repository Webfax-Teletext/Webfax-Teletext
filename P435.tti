OL,6,FThe secluded entrance to the bunker
OL,7,Fnear Axminster, which is hidden
OL,8,Funderneath an outdoor garden toilet,
OL,9,Fcan only be accessed by turning a
OL,10,Flatch underneath what appears to be a
OL,11,Futlity cover a few feet away.
OL,13,F"That is the release mechanism, which
OL,14,Fthen allows us to pull the toilet up
OL,15,Fto reveal a totally concealed
OL,16,Fentrance," Mr Chatterton explains.

OL,4,Cunderneath an outside toilet
OL,6,FThe bunker was used by the Special
OL,7,FDuties Branch, a network of ordinary
OL,8,Fcivilians who were prepared to pass on
OL,9,Finformation in case the Germans
OL,10,Fattempted an invasion.
OL,12,FIt was designed so that the first room
OL,13,Fcontained only a table and chairs, in
OL,14,Forder to avoid suspicion if anyone
OL,15,Fever found it.
OL,17,FThe second room, containing everything
OL,18,Fthat would have been needed to send
OL,19,Finformation on about the Germans,
OL,20,Fcould only be accessed by pulling one
OL,21,Fof the hooks on the wall.
