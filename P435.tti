OL,6,FIt says: "This means the sequence of
OL,7,Fcolours is inverted compared to the
OL,8,Fprimary rainbow, with the secondary
OL,9,Fbow appearing about 10 degrees above
OL,10,Fthe primary bow.
OL,12,F"Surprisingly, this phenomenon is
OL,13,Factually relatively common, especially
OL,14,Fat times when the sun is low in the
OL,15,Fsky such as in the early morning or
OL,16,Flate afternoon.
OL,18,F"The second rainbow is fainter and
OL,19,Fmore 'pastel' in tone than the primary
OL,20,Frainbow because more light escapes
OL,21,Ffrom two reflections compared to one."
