OL,6,FA cider farmer in Somerset fears for
OL,7,Fthis autumn's harvest after the "worst
OL,8,Finfestation of moths in living memory"
OL,9,Fthreatens his apple crops.
OL,11,FThe family-run Burrow Hill Cider Farm
OL,12,Fin Huish Episcopi produces hundreds of
OL,13,Fthousands of litres of cider every
OL,14,Fyear, but its crop has been so
OL,15,Fseverely eaten by moths that the
OL,16,Fdamage is visible from the sky.
OL,18,FA species of moth called the ermine
OL,19,Fhas invaded the trees, creating nests
OL,20,Ffor caterpillars which have stripped
OL,21,Fthem bare.

OL,7,Fadded: "This will survive but it won't
OL,8,Fbe producing any apples next year.
OL,9,FThis year would have been a hell of a

OL,12,F"Because they have nests, sort of

OL,16,FIt's thought the milder winter is one

OL,11,Fthe trees.
OL,13,F"I think it must be something to do

OL,6,FThe fear now, is the impact this

OL,10,FFarmer Julian added: "People sort of
OL,11,Fsay 'oh they're just ermine moths' but
OL,12,Fthey have no idea what it's turned
