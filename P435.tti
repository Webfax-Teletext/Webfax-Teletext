OL,4,CHistoric pub to close after 500 years
OL,6,FAn historic pub in Devon is being
OL,7,Fforced to close its doors after almost
OL,8,F500 years due to rising costs and
OL,9,Fchanging consumer habits.
OL,11,FThe Hole in the Wall holds the title
OL,12,Fof oldest pub in Torquay, having first
OL,13,Fserved drinks to customers in around
OL,14,F1540 - that was the year Henry VIII
OL,15,Fmarried and divorced his fourth wife,
OL,16,Fand explorer Francis Drake was born.
OL,18,FRichard Rossendale-Cook, the pub's
OL,19,Flandlord, says he is being forced to
OL,20,Fshut the venue next month.
