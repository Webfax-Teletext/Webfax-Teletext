OL,6,FShaban Ali was one of the more vocal
OL,7,Fresidents who was impacted. He was
OL,8,Farrested by police in February when

OL,10,Fat the tower block went missing.
OL,12,FThe court heard that in the first week

OL,14,FHouse and took some of the fire alarms
OL,15,Fthat were stored in a corridor ready
OL,16,Fto be installed, and instead hid them
OL,17,Fin his flat.
OL,19,FHe said it was a "misguided protest"
