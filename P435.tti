OL,12,Ffollowing what it called "a change in

OL,6,FHe said: "The problem is it is the
OL,7,Flast remaining community place in the
OL,8,Fvillage. When I arrived in the 60s,
OL,9,Fthere were six pubs, a full range of
OL,10,Fshops.
OL,12,F"Now none of that exists. People have
OL,13,Fto leave to go to work and that means
OL,14,Fthe facilities die off. The village
OL,15,Fneeds a place where communities can

OL,18,FKate Hutchinson, who lives next door
