OL,6,FThe arrival of at least one beaver at
OL,7,FHelman Tor nature reserve in Cornwall
OL,8,Fhas taken experts by surprise, as they
OL,9,Fsuspect it might have been released

OL,12,FCornwall Wildlife Trust said although
OL,13,Fonly one beaver has officially been
OL,14,Fsighted, the extent of the activity in
OL,15,Fthe area suggests there may be more.
OL,17,FStaff at the trust have explained that
OL,18,Falthough it is possible the beavers
OL,19,Farrived naturally, it is more likely
OL,20,Fthe cause is an "unlicensed release by
OL,21,Fan unknown third party".
