OL,14,Fwowing volunteers and group members

OL,8,Fit's my friend, it's someone I trust
OL,9,Fand someone I love dearly. Playing the
OL,10,Fpiano has always been there when

OL,6,FRhys says: ''I became nocturnal in
OL,7,Fthat situation because sleeping rough
OL,8,Fat night is not safe. Doorways are not

OL,14,FHe approached the NightChurch project
OL,15,Fin January seeking support, and a
