OL,6,FResearchers working on a Natural

OL,8,Fdiscovered new ancient seaweed beds
OL,9,Foff the south coast of Cornwall.
OL,11,FA dive team of seaweed experts and
OL,12,Fspecialist survey divers have been
OL,13,Fworking near the Roseland Peninsula
OL,14,Fand St Austell Bay.
OL,16,FNatural England said the team surveyed
OL,17,Fthe sites in detail, and found a vast
OL,18,Farea of "entirely unknown" maerl, a
OL,19,Frare and ancient seaweed.

OL,6,FMaerl is a habitat for many other
OL,7,Fseaweeds and small organisms, and has
OL,8,Fbeen recognised for its crucial role
OL,9,Fin supporting fish popualtions.
OL,11,FIt is classed as an "irreplaceable
OL,12,Fhabitat," because of its almost
OL,13,Fcomplete inability to recover from and
OL,14,Fdamage.
OL,16,FMarine Senior Officer Angela Gall, who
OL,17,Fled the survey, said it is
OL,18,F"incredible" to think that, in
OL,19,FBritain, there are still completely
OL,20,Fundiscovered sites within sight of the
OL,21,Fshore.

OL,6,F"We will use this new evidence on the
OL,7,Fmaerl bed sites to seek better
OL,8,Fprotection for these 'ancient
OL,9,Fwoodlands of the sea,'" she said.
OL,11,FThe divers recorded 110 different
OL,12,Fseaweed and 79 different types of
OL,13,Fanimals living on the maerl, during
OL,14,Ftheir reserach.
OL,16,FThey also collected small smaples for
OL,17,Fgenetic work by the University of
