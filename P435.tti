OL,6,FThe 6am mass ascent took off
OL,7,Fsuccessfully but with a combination of
OL,8,Ffree flying by experienced pilots and
OL,9,Fa tether show from the rest due to
OL,10,Fwind conditions.
OL,12,FPunters were hoping to get a final

OL,15,FThe decision on whether balloons can
OL,16,Ffly is always made relatively last-
OL,17,Fminute, as the weather conditions have
OL,18,Fsuch a big impact on flying. If the
OL,19,Fwind is too strong, temperatures are
OL,20,Ftoo high or the heavens open, sadly it
OL,21,Fmeans the balloons cannot fly.
