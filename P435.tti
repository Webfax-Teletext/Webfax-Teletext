OL,6,FRAPAID founder, Alex Chivers, created
OL,7,Fthe charity when he retired from the
OL,8,Fpolice. In that role, he dealt with
OL,9,Femergency situations in which someone
OL,10,Fcould bleed to death in minutes.
OL,12,FHe questioned why the public didn't
OL,13,Fhave access to the same equipment
OL,14,Fofficers do - causing him to set up
OL,15,FRAPAID.
