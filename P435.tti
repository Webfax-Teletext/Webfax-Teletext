OL,6,FIn Howard's own words on the charity's
OL,7,Fwebsite, he says LIS is a rare
OL,8,Fneurological disorder which causes
OL,9,Fcomplete paralysis of all voluntary
OL,10,Fmuscles, except ones that control the
OL,11,Feyes.
OL,13,FIndividuals with LIS are conscious and
OL,14,Fawake, but have no ability to produce
OL,15,Fmovements or to speak out.
OL,16,FCommunication is possible through eye
OL,17,Fmovements or blinking only.
