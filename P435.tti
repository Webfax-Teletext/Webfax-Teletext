OL,3,C'Utter madness': Minor injury unit in
OL,4,CCornwall closed for the summer
OL,6,FThe decision to close a minor injury
OL,7,Funit in Cornwall for the summer has
OL,8,Fbeen described by residents as "utter
OL,9,Fmadness".
OL,11,FCornwall Foundation Trust announced
OL,12,Fthe summer closure of the Launceston
OL,13,FMIU after it could not find enough
OL,14,Fstaff to "safely provide a 7-day
OL,15,Fservice".
OL,17,FAccording to the trust, the unit will
OL,18,Fbe closed "until it is safe to
OL,19,Freopen", but residents fear it could
OL,20,Fbe a "slippery slope" to a permanent
OL,21,Fclosure.
