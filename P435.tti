OL,6,FA farmer in Somerset has said the
OL,7,Fthreat of repeated flooding is harming
OL,8,Fpeople's mental health, after the
OL,9,FEnvironment Agency (EA) announced it
OL,10,Fis stopping some maintenance work on
OL,11,Fsections of the area's rivers.
OL,13,FJames Winslade, who farms 900 acres of
OL,14,Fland in West Yeo near Moorland, said
OL,15,Fmaintenance is key to preventing
OL,16,Fflooding disasters, like the one that
OL,17,Fhit the Somerset Levels in 2014.
