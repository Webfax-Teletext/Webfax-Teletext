OL,11,FShe said: "It's so important for our

OL,6,FSt Pauls Carnival receives funding
OL,7,Ffrom Arts Council England and Bristol
OL,8,FCity Council, but they have to raise a
OL,9,Fsignificant amount of additional money
OL,10,Fto keep the event free.
OL,12,FThe cost to put on the full event is
OL,13,Festimated at more than #500,000.
OL,15,FLevi Roots, the carnival's chairman,
