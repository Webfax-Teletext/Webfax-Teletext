OL,7,FIt's no coincidence that Rishi Sunak
OL,8,Fhas visited the South West a number of
OL,9,Ftimes already this year.
OL,11,FPolitical polling indicates he faces
OL,12,Fan electoral wipeout - even in places
OL,13,Facross the West Country that have once
OL,14,Fbeen considered safe Tory territory.
OL,16,FOn Thursday 14 March he arrived at
OL,17,FKingsholm Stadium, the home of
OL,18,FGloucester Rugby, flanked by the
OL,19,Fconstituency's MP Richard Graham. It
OL,20,Fhas been Tory since 2010 but is a key
OL,21,FLabour target at the next election.

OL,7,FSpeaking to the media at Kingsholm

OL,12,Fof 2024.
OL,14,FHours later, on ITV West Country, in a
OL,15,Fbid to kill the swirling rumours.
OL,17,F"We have local elections... I am
OL,18,Fsquarely focused on those because they
OL,19,Fare important, and there's not going
OL,20,Fto be a general election on that day,"
OL,21,Fhe told Alex Lovell and Bob Cruwys.
