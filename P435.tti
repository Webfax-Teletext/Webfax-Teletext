OL,7,FMike England said: "The reports were

OL,12,Fwhat state is the boat in.'
OL,14,F"You get on the scene, assess the
OL,15,Fsituation and see what you can do...
OL,16,FThe boat was fairly well submerged and
OL,17,Fthe swell was going in against the
OL,18,Fboat.

OL,6,F"It's always a sad sight, but
OL,7,Freassuring to know the two crew were

OL,9,Fto see the boat underwater and
OL,10,Fbreaking up is a terrible sight.
OL,12,F"It's also terrible to lose people,
