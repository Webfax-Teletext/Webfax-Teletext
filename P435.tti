OL,6,FThe landlord of a pub that charges
OL,7,Fcustomers extra for leaving food on
OL,8,Ftheir plates has justified his
OL,9,Fadditional costs.
OL,11,FMark Graham, the landlord of The Star
OL,12,FInn at Vogue in Cornwall, faced
OL,13,Fcriticism after he charged a pair
OL,14,F#4.80 for wasting food.
OL,16,FThe pub runs an 'eat as much as you
OL,17,Flike' carvery for #12, which allows
OL,18,Fpeople to go up for seconds. But one
OL,19,Fof the conditions of the meal is that
OL,20,Fplates are cleared or else
