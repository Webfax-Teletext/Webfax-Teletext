OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV Channel, Deputy
OL,7,FKirsten Morel, said: "We're not at the
OL,8,Fposition of going with two operators.
OL,9,FWe're at the position where Jersey
OL,10,Fwants and needs more information from
OL,11,Fboth operators to ensure things such
OL,12,Fas financial stability.
OL,14,F"We need to make sure we chose a
OL,15,Fprovider who can provide services for
OL,16,Fthe full 15 years. We don't want
OL,17,FJersey or Guernsey tax payers to be in
OL,18,Fa position where they are forced into
OL,19,Fsome rescue packages."

OL,6,FIt comes amid reports that Condor
OL,7,Fasked the government for a loan of
OL,8,F#80M in the last year, with #10M
OL,9,Fneeded up front to secure their
OL,10,Fservices. This was allegedly rejected

OL,16,Foperator if he can't get a guarantee
OL,17,Fthat Jersey taxpayers will not be
