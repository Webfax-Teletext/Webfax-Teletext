OL,6,FThe court heard that had the money
OL,7,FPeet stole not been spent, it would
OL,8,Fhave paid for her mother's care for
OL,9,Fthe next seven and a half years at
OL,10,Fcurrent rates. That care is now being
OL,11,Ffunded by the taxpayer.
OL,13,FDefence Advocate Natasha Newell said
OL,14,Fthat her client had acted out of
OL,15,Fnaivety and Peet believed her mother
OL,16,Fhad wanted her to use the money for
OL,17,Fthe benefit of herself and her family.
OL,19,FJudge Catherine Fooks, however,
OL,20,Fdescribed it as a "shocking breach of
OL,21,Ftrust".
