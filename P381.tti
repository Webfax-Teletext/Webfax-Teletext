OL,7,FJersey health officials have defended
OL,8,Fending a #56,600 contract for a bus

OL,10,Fdeclining service use and value for

OL,13,FThe Daisy Bus Service provides

OL,17,Fcancer treatment.

OL,7,FHealth and Care Jersey (HCJ), which

OL,9,Fdecided to discontinue the service
OL,10,Ffollowing a review which found that it

OL,13,FHCJ also found it was more

OL,7,FEmily Hoban, the Head of Access for
OL,8,FHCJ, stated: "A notable decline in
OL,9,FJersey patients using the service this
OL,10,Fyear meant that the Daisy Bus was
OL,11,Foperating at a cost of around #60 per
OL,12,Fpassenger journey.
OL,14,F"This is significantly higher than the
OL,15,Faverage cost of a #19 taxi journey.
OL,17,F"The termination of the Daisy Bus
OL,18,Fcontract will not impact Jersey
OL,19,Fpatients as all taxis are already
OL,20,Fbooked and paid for directly by HCJ's
