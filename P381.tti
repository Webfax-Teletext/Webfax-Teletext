OL,3,CAssisted dying in Jersey: A step
OL,4,Ccloser to being legalised
OL,6,FA proposition to introduce in has been
OL,7,Flodged by the Council of Ministers.
OL,9,FIt argues assisted dying should be
OL,10,Flegalised on the island, as long as
OL,11,F"essential provisions and safeguards"
OL,12,Fare met.
OL,14,FTo meet these requirements, the person
OL,15,Fmust:
OL,17,FCrucially, the individual also has to
OL,18,Fmeet certain medical requirements -
OL,19,Fthe plans include two ways of defining
OL,20,Fwhat this will mean.

OL,9,FRoute 1 would allow for assisted dying
OL,10,Fwhen the individual has been diagnosed

OL,8,Fparticipate in the provision of
OL,9,Fassisted dying.
OL,11,FIt also underlines the importance of a

OL,11,FFor example, in the state of Oregon in
