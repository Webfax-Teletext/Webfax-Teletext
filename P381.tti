OL,6,FThe organiser of Guernsey's Community
OL,7,FBunting Project says she has been
OL,8,Foverwhelmed by the response from
OL,9,Fislanders, with more than 130 groups

OL,6,FMegs Bailey came up with the idea
OL,7,Fafter feeling frustrated at how
OL,8,FLiberation Day celebrations altered
OL,9,Fduring and after the Covid outbreak as
OL,10,Fmore smaller Parish events were
OL,11,Forganised, compared to the traditional
OL,12,Fgathering of crowds in central St
OL,13,FPeter Port where, in 1945, the
OL,14,FLiberation took place.
OL,16,FShe explains that the bunting honours
OL,17,Fthe 'make do and mend' ethos of the
OL,18,FOccupation when materials were hard to
OL,19,Fcome by.

OL,6,FMegs adds: "Rather than just flood the
OL,7,Ftown with red, white and blue ready-
OL,8,Fmade bunting, I thought it would be a
OL,9,Fbrilliant way to use up offcuts and
OL,10,Funwanted fabrics, rather than see them
OL,11,Fgoing to landfill.
OL,13,F"A perfect way to recycle and after
OL,14,Fall, it's just what would have
OL,15,Fhappened in 1945. Besides producing
OL,16,Fthe bunting, it is also an opportunity
OL,17,Ffor islanders from all walks of life,
OL,18,Facross the generations, to work
OL,19,Ftogether and feel a part of the
OL,20,FLiberation Day celebrations.
