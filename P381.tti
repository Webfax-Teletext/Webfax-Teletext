OL,6,FThe Jersey Minister responsible for
OL,7,Fdeciding which ferry operator will
OL,8,Fservice the island has outlined a new
OL,9,Ftender process, but branded Condor's
OL,10,Fbid as "unlikely to deliver" and
OL,11,F"overly optimistic given the high
OL,12,Flevels of debt".
OL,14,FDeputy Kirsten Morel told the States

OL,16,FCondor's aged fleet and financial woes
OL,17,Fwere "concerns" for the island, adding
OL,18,Fthere was "no guarantee of there ever
OL,19,Fbeing future fleet investment."
