OL,7,Fthe company is spending #4 million
OL,8,Fthis year on upgrading Jersey's ageing
OL,9,Fgas network to provide an "even better

OL,12,FIn an exclusive interview with ITV
OL,13,FNews, Graeme Millar, who was appointed
OL,14,FCEO in December following the
OL,15,Fdeparture of Jo Cox, explains that

OL,12,FSpeaking about why there is an urgency
OL,13,Fnow to invest and improve the island's
OL,14,Fgas network, Mr Millar says: "We're
OL,15,Fconstantly working on safety,
OL,16,Freliability and greenness, and one of
OL,17,Fthe things that we do is we work with

OL,9,Fthat, we assess the quality of the

OL,13,FPushed on whether islanders' gas bills
OL,14,Fwould increase as a result of the
OL,15,Finfrastructure improvements, Mr Millar
OL,16,Fexplains the upgrades are being funded
OL,17,Fthrough cashflow and adds: "Prices are

OL,20,Fand clearly we're subject to global

OL,6,FDespite some residents switching from
OL,7,Fgas to electricity, Mr Millar believes
OL,8,Fthere are opportunities to grow the
OL,9,Fcompany's customer base by targeting
OL,10,Fthose who still use oil as an energy
OL,11,Fsource.
OL,13,FHe hopes these islanders can be
OL,14,Fpersuaded to switch to gas, something
OL,15,Fhe says would "reduce the CO2
OL,16,Femissions by about a third".
OL,18,FHe explains: "It's not just about

OL,20,Fpotentially a transition fuel and a
OL,21,Fgood alternative to oil.
