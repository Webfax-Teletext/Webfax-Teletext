OL,6,FA Jersey grower has produced a giant
OL,7,Fcabbage "by accident" on his farm in
OL,8,FSt John.
OL,10,FFarmer, Ollie Griggs said: "I thought
OL,11,Fit was a completely different variety
OL,12,F(of cabbage) that would grow very
OL,13,Fquickly and would turn into a small
OL,14,Fpointed cabbage that I could cut and
OL,15,Fsell as quickly as possible.
OL,17,F"But low and behold it was something
OL,18,Fcompletely different, I should have
OL,19,Fplanted it at a different time of year.

OL,6,F"It never actually made a head and
OL,7,Ftherefore I didn't know what to do
OL,8,Fwith it. I've left it all summer long
OL,9,Fand that's why it's as big as it is."
OL,11,FAs impressive as it is Ollie said it
OL,12,Fwould likely be turned into sauerkraut
OL,13,For feed for his chickens as buyers
OL,14,Fmight be "overwhelmed" by its size.
OL,16,FFor any islanders hoping to replicate
OL,17,FOllie's success, he recommends
OL,18,Fprotecting cabbages as much as
OL,19,Fpossible.

OL,6,FHe said: "Cabbages can be a bit tricky
OL,7,Fbecause everything likes to eat them,
OL,8,Fthe insects like them, the rabbits
OL,9,Flike them, if you have chickens they
OL,10,Flike them and the pigeons like them.
OL,12,F"You'll probably need to cover them
OL,13,Feither with a fine insect net or a

OL,16,FBut he added: "They are very easy to

OL,18,Fin our conditions make sure you keep
OL,19,Fthem covered."
