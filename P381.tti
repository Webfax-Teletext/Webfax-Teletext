OL,6,FThe Forum's chair, Carla Benest, said:
OL,7,F"Having greater financial compensation

OL,9,Fbusinesses to ensure that they are

OL,12,F"It also enables individuals to bring

OL,16,FAlongside compensation limit
OL,17,Fincreases, the Forum recommends giving

OL,10,Fput stress on local businesses.
OL,12,FHe explained: "I think what we're

OL,15,Fand that means we're likely to have
