OL,6,FJersey's Health Policy Director has
OL,7,Fwarned that making abortions free on
OL,8,Fthe island would risk creating a
OL,9,F"perverse incentive" to use the
OL,10,Fservice as a form of birth control.
OL,12,FRuth Johnson suggested that while most
OL,13,Fcontraception comes at a cost for
OL,14,Fislanders, people may opt to terminate
OL,15,Fpregnancies instead if the process
OL,16,Fbecame free.
