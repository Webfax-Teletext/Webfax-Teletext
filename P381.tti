OL,6,FMs Manuel explained the victim could

OL,8,Fconfused due to her dementia and
OL,9,Fsometimes offered "a small amount of
OL,10,Fresistance", but it was "not angry or

OL,13,FMs Manuel then said she heard the
OL,14,Fsound of a slap - she did not see it

OL,16,Fthe victim's right eye.
OL,18,FMs Manuel confronted Vieira, who said,
OL,19,F"I'm not going to wait for her to
OL,20,Fpunch me" and admitted she had slapped

OL,13,FVieria asked Ms Manuel to lie about

OL,16,Falerted the night nurse in charge.
