OL,6,FA Guernsey charity has been taken
OL,7,Faback by the demand for its new
OL,8,Ftemporary housing pods.
OL,10,FCaritas, a charity supporting those
OL,11,Fexperiencing homelessness, installed
OL,12,Ftwo emergency "sleeping pods" in the
OL,13,FVale Douzaine car park at the end of
OL,14,Flast year.
OL,16,FIn just over one month, the pods,
OL,17,Fwhich feature a bed, toilet, charging
OL,18,Fpoint, light, and hand sanitation
OL,19,Ffacilities, have been used on six
OL,20,Foccasions.

OL,9,FGraham Merfield, Chair of Caritas,
OL,10,Ftold ITV News: "We've had some people

OL,11,FWhile the pods do not offer a long-
