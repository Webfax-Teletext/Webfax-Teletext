OL,11,FIn the changes proposed by Jersey's
OL,12,FInfrastructure Minister, Constable
OL,13,FAndy Jehan, islanders could face legal

OL,16,FUnder the current law, there is no

OL,6,FIn the Draft Road Traffic Law report,
OL,7,FMr Jehan says this "limits the ability

OL,13,FHe outlines: "The lack of evidential

OL,16,Fand has made successful prosecutions

OL,11,FThe proposals initially focus on
OL,12,Flimits for cannabis, with Mr Jehan
OL,13,Fproposing a 5g/L (micrograms per

OL,16,FIn the UK, the limit for cannabis is
