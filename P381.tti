OL,6,Fbeen renewed for a further three years.
OL,8,FThe initiative, established to
OL,9,Fsafeguard tenants' deposits at the end
OL,10,Fof their tenancy, makes it a legal
OL,11,Fobligation for landlords to properly
OL,12,Fprotect a deposit.
OL,14,FFailure to comply may result in
OL,15,Fprosecution.
OL,17,FHousing Minister, Deputy Sam Mezec
OL,18,Fsays, "Any landlord who does take a
OL,19,Fdeposit from their tenant must use
OL,20,Fthis scheme - it is actually a
OL,21,Fcriminal offence not to comply.

OL,5,FIt means deposits are held securely
OL,6,Ffor the length of a tenancy, with
OL,7,Finterest from them used to fund the

OL,10,FDeputy Mezec says it is important
OL,11,Ftenants know if their landlords have
OL,12,Fsigned up.
OL,14,FHe explains: "Tenants should be given

OL,16,FIf they don't hear anything, they can
OL,17,Fgo to Mydeposits and ask if they have

OL,19,Ffind out.
