OL,6,FWe took mobile phones from 12 pupils

OL,11,FBefore saying their goodbyes, the Year
OL,12,F9 students revealed just how much time
OL,13,Fthey normally spend looking at their
OL,14,Fdevices.
OL,16,FThe highest average was five hours and
OL,17,F51 minutes a day, just on their phone
OL,18,F- that's around 42 hours per week and
OL,19,Fmore than 90 days per year.
