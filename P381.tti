OL,6,FVolunteers have been planting a range
OL,7,Fof species along the popular path,
OL,8,Fused by walkers, runners and cyclists,
OL,9,Fincluding pine trees.
OL,11,FBen Parkes, from Jersey Trees for
OL,12,FLife, said: "We've tried to use
OL,13,Fspecies that can handle windy, exposed
OL,14,Fsites in very free draining soil that
OL,15,Fwe do have up here. The pines are
OL,16,Fperfect.
OL,18,F"There are pine trees all the way
OL,19,Falong the Railway Walk, it's kind of
OL,20,Fsynonymous with the area, so we want
OL,21,Fto try and stick with that.

OL,6,F"We've chosen Austrian black pine
OL,7,Fbecause they're very resilient to wind
OL,8,Fand they're found all over central
OL,9,FEurope as well, so they go as far down
OL,10,Fsouth as Turkey I believe. So with our

OL,15,FBen added that he hopes some areas
