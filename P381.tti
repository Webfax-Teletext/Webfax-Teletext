OL,6,FOn Friday evening, Blue Islands
OL,7,Fsuddenly announced that it was
OL,8,Fimmediately suspending all operations
OL,9,Fand has since decided to go into
OL,10,Fliquidation.
OL,12,FITV News understands it left
OL,13,Fapproximately 1,200 customers stranded
OL,14,Fand many more out of pocket as all
OL,15,F21,000 future bookings were cancelled.
OL,17,FPassengers who still need their
OL,18,Fflights have therefore been forced to
OL,19,F'pay twice' after rebooking with

OL,16,FHe explains: "Many people will simply
