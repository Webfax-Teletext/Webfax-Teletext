OL,7,FThe family of a Jersey man who died of
OL,8,Fa cardiac arrest while in the care of
OL,9,Fparamedics has spoken out for the
OL,10,Ffirst time.
OL,12,F39 year old Frazer Irvine died in
OL,13,FMarch 2022, whilst in the care of
OL,14,Fparamedics Tom Le Sauteur, 36, and
OL,15,FJohn Sutherland, 61.
OL,17,FLe Sauteur and Sutherland were found
OL,18,Fguilty of failing to provide
OL,19,Freasonable care to a man in the
OL,20,Fmoments before his death.

OL,7,FIn a statement, Mr Irvine's family
OL,8,Fsaid: "Frazer was a much-loved son,
OL,9,Fbrother, uncle and friend. The efforts
OL,10,Fto portray Frazer as a violent,
OL,11,Faggressive drunk could not be further
OL,12,Ffrom the truth.
OL,14,F"Anyone who viewed the CCTV that the
OL,15,Fparamedics obviously never realised
OL,16,Fwas recording, the subsequent evidence
OL,17,Ffrom body worn cameras and the
OL,18,Fevidence provided in court by
OL,19,Fwitnesses will be aware of the truth."
