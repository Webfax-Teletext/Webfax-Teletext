OL,6,FLieutenant Bailiff Anthony Olsen MBE -
OL,7,Fthe Jurat who read the sentence - told
OL,8,Fthe court that it was "clear" that the

OL,10,F"caring and gentle" in their approach.
OL,12,FHe added that a custodial sentence was
OL,13,Fneeded as Le Claire was a "high risk
OL,14,Fof reconviction".
