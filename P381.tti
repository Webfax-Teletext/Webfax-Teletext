OL,6,FTwo of Jersey's largest homelessness
OL,7,Fcharities say their services are being
OL,8,Fplaced under increasing strain from
OL,9,Fgrowing demand.
OL,11,FIt comes after the Shelter Trust's
OL,12,Fannual 'Tinathon' received a record
OL,13,Fnumber of donations, with 13,000 tins
OL,14,Fcollected for those in need.
OL,16,FAs well as supplying kitchens across
OL,17,Fthe charity's seven homeless shelters,
OL,18,Fthey are also used in food parcels for
OL,19,Fthose struggling to make ends meet.

OL,6,FRichard Robins, organiser of the
OL,7,FTinathon, says: "Demand continues to
OL,8,Fincrease and times are hard for a lot
OL,9,Fof people, so those food parcels mean
OL,10,Fa lot."
OL,12,FHe adds that whilst many people do not
OL,13,Ffeel as though there is a significant
OL,14,Fhomelessness problem on the island, it
OL,15,Fstill exists.
OL,17,FRichard explains: "It is definitely a
OL,18,Fhidden issue and one of the purposes
OL,19,Fof an event like the Tinathon is to
OL,20,Fmake people aware that it is still a
OL,21,Fproblem in Jersey.

OL,9,FTim Ringsdore, Chief Executive Officer
OL,10,Fof the Sanctuary Trust, another local
OL,11,Fhomelessness charity, agrees.
OL,13,FHe says: "Unfortunately, the problem

OL,16,F"There's currently over 340 people
