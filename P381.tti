OL,6,FPeople in could become eligible for

OL,10,FDeputy Lucy Stephenson has lodged it,
OL,11,Fcalling for an improved funding model
OL,12,Ffor treatment.
OL,14,FCurrently, government support is means-
OL,15,Ftested and only covers the medication
OL,16,Fcost for three cycles, around #3,000
OL,17,Fin total.
OL,19,FHowever, fees on top of this mean it
OL,20,Fcan cost more than #7,000 per round.

OL,6,FIf these changes are approved, would

OL,10,FIn the current means-tested system,
OL,11,Fthere is funding for the full cost of
OL,12,Ftreatment for couples with a combined
OL,13,Fincome of up to #40,795.
OL,15,FHowever, if two people work full-time

OL,19,FDeputy Stephenson says no one has ever

OL,6,FOperations Manager Chloe Fosse said:
OL,7,F"Infertility is a disease and it is
OL,8,Ftime that our government and
OL,9,Fhealthcare system recognise it as
OL,10,Fsuch. The current means-tested funding
OL,11,Fsystem is outdated and unobtainable to

OL,13,Fvoiced over and over again the real-
OL,14,Flife impact that the lack of a fair
OL,15,Fand equitable funding system is having
OL,16,Fon those who need IVF treatment to
OL,17,Fconceive."
