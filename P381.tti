OL,6,FA Guernsey fisher has expressed his
OL,7,Fconcern over the decline in brown
OL,8,Fcrabs in Channel Island waters.
OL,10,FThe decrease has been attributed to
OL,11,Fwarmer water temperatures, scallop
OL,12,Ffishing, dredging and a rise in some
OL,13,Foctopus species in the Channel Islands.
OL,15,FClive Brown, who has been crabbing in
OL,16,FGuernsey since he was a teenager, told
OL,17,FITV News: "This has come on quite
OL,18,Fquickly, this lack of crab."

OL,12,FJason Hamon, a local fishmonger, said:
OL,13,F"There are plenty of lobsters around

OL,6,FIn 2021 a team from Jersey Marine

OL,11,FMarine ecologist Dr Samantha Blampied
OL,12,Fsays many of the crabs have headed
