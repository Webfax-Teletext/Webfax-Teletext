OL,3,CSTV News: a new but familiar look
OL,5,GThe revamp of STV News looks good but
OL,6,Gis hardly worth the hyperbole of some
OL,7,Gclickbait articles.
OL,9,FIt is a simple evolution of the look
OL,10,Fof the programme.
OL,12,FIts last significant visual overhaul
OL,13,Fwas 10 years ago. Time alone means it
OL,14,Fis now time to freshen things up.
OL,16,FEverything changes but everything
OL,17,Fremains the same.
OL,19,FThe new set is still a very similar
OL,20,Fshade of blue. The signature tune has
OL,21,Fonly been remixed slightly.

OL,3,CSTV News: a new but familiar look
OL,5,FThe format of the programme ` revised
OL,6,Flast year when dual presentation from
OL,7,Fboth Glasgow and Edinburgh ended `
OL,8,Fremains the same.
OL,10,FThe advantage of the new set is that
OL,11,Fit looks more modern and allows more
OL,12,Fspace for reporters to join the
OL,13,Fpresenter.
OL,15,FBut I bet 90% of viewers will hardly
OL,16,Fnotice the changes in a couple of
OL,17,Fweeks. And this is how it should be.
OL,19,FThe days when regional news programmes
OL,20,Fgot brand new looks every two or three
OL,21,Fyears are thankfully gone.

OL,5,FNew looks always brought complaints `
OL,6,Fsome viewers simply disliked the

OL,9,FThe STV News at 6 is a successful

OL,11,Fa new set, refresh the graphics and
OL,12,Fpotentially enhance the programme

OL,3,CSTV News: a new but familiar look
OL,5,FBy my reckoning there were five
OL,6,Fdistinct looks for what was then
OL,7,FScotland Today between 1986 and 1996.
OL,8,FEach change brought completely new
OL,9,Ftitles, music and sets plus
OL,10,Falterations to the format.
OL,12,FIn contrast News at Ten stayed
OL,13,Ffundamentally unchanged from 1967 to
OL,14,F1992. Each new look kept the core
OL,15,Felements and format, simply freshening
OL,16,Fup the appearance and taking advantage
OL,17,Fof new technology.
OL,19,FThere is no suggestion of any change
OL,20,Fto the format of STV News soon.

OL,12,FWhether they'd ever dare to record
