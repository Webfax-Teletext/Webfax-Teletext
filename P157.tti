OL,5,GAn issue with the playout of the
OL,6,Gearly evening national weather
OL,7,Gforecast led to a short technical
OL,8,Gbreakdown on BBC One.
OL,10,FThe national weather forecast was due
OL,11,Fto air immediately after the early
OL,12,Fevening regional news on BBC One.
OL,14,FJust over a minute of black and
OL,15,Fsilence went out on the BBC One
OL,16,Fnetwork feed, instead of the national
OL,17,Fweather.
OL,19,FMany of the English regions cut back
OL,20,Fto network immediately after their
OL,21,Flocal news programmes and took the
OL,22,Fperiod of black and silence.
