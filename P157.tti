OL,5,GA bit of common sense will benefit
OL,6,GVirgin Media customers from this week.
OL,8,FVirgin is reorganising its Electronic
OL,9,FProgramme Guide and is adopting one
OL,10,Fof Sky's best ideas.
OL,12,FA dedicated section is being created
OL,13,Ffor timeshift (i.e., plus one)
OL,14,Fchannels.
OL,16,FThis means these channels will be
OL,17,Fmuch easier to find as there will
OL,18,Falways be a clear link between the
OL,19,Fnumber of the main service and its
OL,20,Ftimeshift sibling. For instance, ITV
OL,21,F1 + 1 will be on 303 and Channel 4 +
OL,22,F1 will be on 304.

OL,5,FIn turn, this frees up slots to
OL,6,Fpromote several channels up the list.
OL,8,FA few years ago, Sky did something
OL,9,Fsimilar. It cleared up the main
OL,10,Fsection of its EPG by creating
OL,11,Fdedicated sections for timeshift
OL,12,Fchannels and legacy SD services.
OL,14,FIt's all about simplicity and making
OL,15,Fnavigation as easy as possible for
OL,16,Fviewers.
OL,18,FSo Is it time to clear up the
OL,19,FFreeview EPG? It, frankly, is a mess.

OL,5,FThis is all the more ironic as one of
OL,6,FFreeview's main selling points is
OL,7,Fthat it is the simple option for
OL,8,Fthose who may find technology
OL,9,Fconfusing.
OL,11,FThe main section of the Freeview EPG
OL,12,Fis a ragbag.
OL,14,FShopping channels and plus one
OL,15,Fchannels sit in random locations.
OL,17,FThe lower part of the guide is messed

OL,5,FThere is the issue of how HD channels

OL,7,FFreeview has been trying to sort this
OL,8,Fout through technology.
OL,10,FAnd lastly there's even a little
OL,11,Fconfusion over the numbers of some
OL,12,FBBC services in Scotland.
OL,14,FSo here are my thoughts on a much-

OL,5,FA shopping section might seem
OL,6,Fsensible and has been suggested
OL,7,Fbefore. But understandably QVC would
OL,8,Fno doubt be concerned about losing a
OL,9,Frelatively prominent slot.
OL,11,FOccasionally placeholder channels
OL,12,Fcome good too. I would not be
OL,13,Fsurprised if ITV 3 + 1 becomes a full-
OL,14,Ftime service when CITV closes as a
OL,15,Flinear channel soon.
OL,17,FStill the basic need for a bit of
OL,18,Flinearity and logic is clear.
OL,20,FI am sure the overall number of
OL,21,Fchannels will continue to drop over
OL,22,Fthe next few years.
