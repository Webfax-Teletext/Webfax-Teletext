OL,8,Gfar. Mr Bates vs The Post Office was
OL,9,Gevent TV, won good overnight viewing
OL,10,Gfigures and brought the Horizon
OL,11,Gscandal back to public attention.
OL,13,FIt was also relatively cheap for a
OL,14,Fdrama. It was not a lavish production
OL,15,Fand some of the cast apparently
OL,16,Faccepted lower fees than they might
OL,17,Fhave been able to command.
