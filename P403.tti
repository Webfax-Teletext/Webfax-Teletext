OL,6,FEddie Pessoa de Araujo was just six-

OL,8,Fhuge mass in his chest which had moved
OL,9,Fhis heart towards the centre.
OL,11,FHis parents had been worried for a

OL,13,Fhaving low-grade fevers which made him

OL,16,FHis mother Harri, from London, told
OL,17,Fthe PA news agency: "What we started
