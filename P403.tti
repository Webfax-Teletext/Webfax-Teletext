OL,6,FThe event began in 1896, as the
OL,7,F'Emancipation Run', to celebrate the
OL,8,FLocomotives on Highways Act of that
OL,9,Fyear, which scrapped the need for a
OL,10,Fperson to walk in front of the car
OL,11,Fwith a red flag, and raised the speed
OL,12,Flimit from 4mph to 14mph.
OL,14,FThe car run stopped after 1903, but
OL,15,Fwas revived in 1927, and has taken
OL,16,Fplace most years since.
OL,18,FThe first of the cars arrived in
OL,19,FBrighton roughly three hours after
OL,20,Fsetting off.
