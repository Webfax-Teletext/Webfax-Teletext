OL,6,FGeorge Galloway has accused police of
OL,7,Fstopping him at Gatwick Airport as a
OL,8,Fpretext for "a fishing expedition" on
OL,9,Fhis phone and laptop.
OL,11,FThe 71-year-old and his wife Putri
OL,12,FGayatri Pertiwi are threatening legal
OL,13,Faction after they were stopped on
OL,14,FSaturday after flying to the UK from
OL,15,FMoscow via Dubai.
OL,17,FFormer MP Mr Galloway said the
OL,18,Fquestions he was asked by
OL,19,Finvestigators were "generic musings"
OL,20,Fthat he claims were an excuse to seize
OL,21,Fand analyse the couple's devices.
