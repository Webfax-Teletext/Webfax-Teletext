OL,6,FThe walk out was planned because the
OL,7,Funion claimed other London Underground
OL,8,Fworkers who perform the same roles are
OL,9,Fpaid up to #10,000 more a year.
OL,11,FUnite said the disparity is causing
OL,12,FTramlink staffing shortages because
OL,13,Fworkers leave as soon as a higher paid
OL,14,Fjob becomes available.
OL,16,FUnite general secretary Sharon Graham
OL,17,Fsaid: "For years, Transport for London
