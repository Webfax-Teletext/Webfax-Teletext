OL,7,Fsaid: "Science tells us that the

OL,11,Fis a place to spark imagination, to

OL,15,F"The question I'm asking today is a

OL,9,FDr Aaron Thierry, a scientist who
OL,10,Fjoined the protest, said: "It's not
OL,11,Fjust Adani's brand that the science
OL,12,Fmuseum is greenwashing, they're also
OL,13,Fallowing the oil and gas giants BP and
OL,14,FEquinor to sponsor their exhibits,
