OL,6,GThe 80th anniversary of VE Day
OL,7,Ghighlighted the need for the BBC.
OL,9,FIt seems strange to think that such a
OL,10,Fsignificant moment in national life
OL,11,Freceived scarcely any attention
OL,12,Foutside of news programmes on other
OL,13,Fmajor channels.
OL,15,FBBC One's schedule was, of course,
OL,16,Fdominated by coverage of the actual
OL,17,Fevents connected to the anniversary.
OL,19,FNobody would suggest nowadays that
OL,20,Fduplication on another channel would
OL,21,Fserve any worthwhile purpose.

OL,6,FIn an era of fake news ` or where
OL,7,Fpeople can live in bubbles ` that is
OL,8,Fmore important than ever.
OL,10,FIt is interesting to reflect on how
OL,11,Fboth main channels marked the 40th
OL,12,Fanniversary of peace in Europe in
OL,13,F1985. This was the first time the
OL,14,Fanniversary was widely celebrated.
OL,16,FThere was some special programming on
OL,17,Fboth channels. In particular, BBC One
OL,18,Fshowed a superb Newsnight documentary
OL,19,Fwhich featured rare colour film to
OL,20,Ftell the story of the last year of the
OL,21,Fwar in Europe.

OL,6,FBut arguably ITV's coverage of the
OL,7,Fanniversary itself was better than the
OL,8,FBBC's.
OL,10,FTo begin, the BBC ran an extended
OL,11,Fedition of Breakfast Time ` then a
OL,12,Fmagazine programme. It attempted to
OL,13,Fcapture the mood of the day and stayed
OL,14,Fon air until the national service of
OL,15,Fthanksgiving began at 11.15am `
OL,16,Fpausing, awkwardly, for Play School
OL,17,Fwhich you might have thought could
OL,18,Fhave moved over to BBC Two for the day.

OL,6,FWe don't know how TV-am marked the

OL,12,Fsix months earlier and was even
OL,13,Fwarning of the risk it could lose its

OL,16,FBut when ITV itself came on the air at
