OL,6,FCriminals have long been using social
OL,7,Fmedia and the online world to target
OL,8,Fvictims - but as technology advances,
OL,9,Fso do their tactics.
OL,11,FAccording to Action Fraud, as many as
OL,12,F22,530 people reported their online
OL,13,Faccounts had been hacked in 2023, with
OL,14,Fvictims losing a total of #1.3 million.
OL,16,FKathryn Goldby from the Cyber Helpline
OL,17,Ftold ITV News the organisation has
OL,18,Fnoticed fraudsters are learning how to
OL,19,Fmake attacks more personal.

OL,10,F"There's always an aspect of playing

OL,16,FAccording to Ms Goldby , some kinds of
