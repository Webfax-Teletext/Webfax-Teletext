OL,6,FI have interviewed Ozzy Osbourne and

OL,8,Fthe years. My years working in the
OL,9,FMidlands for the BBC brought me into
OL,10,Fcontact with the band, and it was
OL,11,Falways a joy to sit down with them.
OL,13,FOzzy was simply one of the funniest
OL,14,Fpeople I've ever met in my life. What
OL,15,Fwas it about the way he delivered a
OL,16,Fsentence? Was it the Brummie accent?
OL,18,FThe years in the US had at times left
OL,19,Fa Californian twang, but at its heart,
OL,20,Fhis accent was pure Birmingham.

OL,16,Fto the city. I'd really like to, he

OL,6,FHaving seen Ozzy on stage both with
OL,7,FSabbath and as a solo artist over the
OL,8,Fyears, what you'd expect from him is
OL,9,Fthat he would charge around the stage
OL,10,Ffrom one side to the other, not
OL,11,Fnecessarily in rhythm with the music,
OL,12,Fbut every inch an icon.
OL,14,FSo there was some sadness as I watched
OL,15,Fhim just weeks ago with the original
OL,16,FSabbath lineup at Villa Park, just
OL,17,Fstreets away from where he and the
OL,18,Fband grew up in the 40s and 50s. How

OL,8,Fillnesses over the years, including a
