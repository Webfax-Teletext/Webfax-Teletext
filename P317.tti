OL,10,FPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has

OL,6,FHowever, since then, it's fair to say
OL,7,Fit's been a stormy ride for him and
OL,8,Fthe Labour Party.
OL,10,FShortly after becoming prime minister,
OL,11,Fhe attracted attention for the scale
OL,12,Fof the gifts he had been receiving,
OL,13,Fand more recently in September his

OL,17,FWhen asked if he could "hand on heart"
OL,18,Fsay that his government had restored
