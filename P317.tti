OL,6,FAs an earthquake devastated Turkey,
OL,7,FMuhammed was trapped under the rubble
OL,8,Fin the arms of his dead father. One
OL,9,Fyear on, ITV News's Emma Murphy meets
OL,10,Fhim with the woman who helped save his
OL,11,Flife
OL,13,FIt had been a week filled with
OL,14,Ftragedy, where the dead lay on the
OL,15,Fstreets or beneath their homes and the
OL,16,Fliving struggled to comprehend what
OL,17,Fthey had survived and all they had
OL,18,Flost.JDay after day we had seen bodies
OL,19,Fbeing pulled from beneath the rubble
OL,20,Fas the death toll mounted.
