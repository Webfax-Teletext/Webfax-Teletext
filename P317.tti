OL,3,CNo bail but no life sentence either -

OL,6,FThey were quickly disappointed. Comb's
OL,7,Fdefence team had argued that because
OL,8,Fthe jury had "resoundingly rejected"
OL,9,Fthe prosecution's depiction of him, he
OL,10,Fshould be allowed to return to his
OL,11,Fluxury home in Miami. Combs had been a
OL,12,Fmodel prisoner, they said, and would
OL,13,Fhave no access to his plane.
OL,15,FThat mattered because of the
OL,16,Fprosecution's argument that the
OL,17,Fmultimillionaire rapper would be a
OL,18,Fflight risk, given that he faces a
OL,19,Fcustodial sentence they estimated
OL,20,Fwould be around four to five years.
