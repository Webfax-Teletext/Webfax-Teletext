OL,6,FThe Princess of Wales has called for
OL,7,Fthe "stigma" faced by those with
OL,8,Faddictions to end and society to show
OL,9,F"compassion and love" to those
OL,10,Fdependent on drugs, alcohol or
OL,11,Fgambling.
OL,13,FKate said society's experience of
OL,14,Faddiction was "shaped by fear, shame,
OL,15,Fand judgment." She urged people to
OL,16,Fhave open conversations and bring the
OL,17,Fissue "out of the shadows," in a
OL,18,Fmessage to mark Addiction Awareness
OL,19,FWeek, which runs from November 23 to
