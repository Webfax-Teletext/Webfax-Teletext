OL,6,FEven before today, it was becoming
OL,7,Fincreasingly clear to me that the
OL,8,Fbudget would include a significant
OL,9,Frise in income tax - because it is the
OL,10,Fonly clean way, ministers tell me, to
OL,11,Ffill the #35 billion budget black hole.
OL,13,FStarmer seemed to me today to reveal
OL,14,Fhe believes an increase in income tax
OL,15,Fis inevitable.
OL,17,FI am less clear that the Chancellor is
OL,18,Fyet at that settled position, possibly
OL,19,Fbecause she is not sure she can
OL,20,Fsurvive the political thunderclap.

OL,6,FIf Rachel Reeves were to increase the
OL,7,Fbasic rate of income tax on 26
OL,8,FNovember, it would be the first rise
OL,9,Fin the basic rate since 1975, when
OL,10,FHarold Wilson raised it to 35%.
OL,12,FSuccessive Tory and Labour governments
OL,13,Fhave subsequently cut it to the 20%
OL,14,Frate of today.

OL,17,Fpolitical and economic significance of
OL,18,Fthis moment.
