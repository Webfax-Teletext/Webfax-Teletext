OL,3,CIs the Single Justice Procedure unjust?
OL,5,FFor nearly a decade, suspected
OL,6,Flawbreakers have been prosecuted under
OL,7,Fthe Single Justice procedure, which
OL,8,Fwas brought in to speed up verdicts on
OL,9,F"lower-level" crimes.
OL,11,FBut, a joint investigation between ITV
OL,12,FNews and the Evening Standard has
OL,13,Frevealed that this has meant people
OL,14,Fhave been wrongly prosecuted.
OL,16,FSo what's happening to stop it
OL,17,Fhappening again? And can anything be
OL,18,Fdone for the people already affected?
