OL,4,Con cancel culture and conspiracies
OL,6,FWhen Jon Ronson wrote a book about
OL,7,Fcancel culture in 2015, the people
OL,8,Fbeing labelled 'woke' were the Left
OL,9,Fand those being cancelled were often
OL,10,Fon the Right.
OL,12,FBut two big changes since then suggest
OL,13,Fcancel culture is over.
OL,15,FAfter Elon Musk bought Twitter, people
OL,16,Fcan no longer be cancelled on one of
OL,17,Fthe world's biggest social media
OL,18,Fsites, while Donald Trump's return as
OL,19,FUS president suggests that is also
OL,20,Ftrue in real life.

OL,9,Fwatched the idea of 'woke' morph in

OL,15,Fit was used by the Right to criticise
