OL,6,FCharlotte, who has lived at the
OL,7,Faquarium since 2016, became the centre
OL,8,Fof a media storm in February after it
OL,9,Fwas announced that she was pregnant -
OL,10,Fdespite having no contact with male
OL,11,Fstingrays for almost a decade.
OL,13,FThis phenomenon, where an animal
OL,14,Fessentially impregnates herself, is
OL,15,Ftermed "parthenogenesis".
OL,17,FIt occurs when a female uses her own
OL,18,Funfertilised eggs to create a
OL,19,Fgenetically complete clone in the
OL,20,Fabsence of males of her own species.
