OL,8,FParis, deals with a TV star played by
OL,9,FDemi Moore, who is deemed too old for
OL,10,Fthe screen by her sexist boss, who
OL,11,Fwants someone younger.
OL,13,FThe role has given Moore, now 62, her
OL,14,Ffirst Golden Globe award and now her
OL,15,Ffirst Oscar nomination. It has made
OL,16,Fdirector Fargeat only the eighth woman
OL,17,Fto ever get a best director nomination
OL,18,Fin the Oscars' 97 year history. Only
OL,19,Fthree women have ever won that award.

OL,7,FIn taking aim at ageism and sexism,
OL,8,FFargeat does not hold back. The anger
OL,9,Fis visible in the scenes of true body

OL,11,Fachievement that has also put The
OL,12,FSubstance in the running for best film
OL,13,Fat next month's awards.
OL,15,FShe is of course dismayed at the
OL,16,Fstatistics that show the
OL,17,Funderrepresentation of women at
OL,18,FHollywood's top table, male directors
OL,19,Fwere overwhelmingly behind the biggest
OL,20,Fbox office hits of the last year. It's
OL,21,Fnot like we are less skilled, she says.
