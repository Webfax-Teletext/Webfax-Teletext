OL,6,FWhat is bluetongue?
OL,8,FBluetongue is a virus spread by biting
OL,9,Fmidges which impacts livestock such as
OL,10,Fcattle, sheep and goats.
OL,12,FIt can also affect deer and llamas,
OL,13,Fbut humans and food safety are not at
OL,14,Frisk.
OL,16,FIn rare cases, dogs can catch
OL,17,Fbluetongue if they eat infected
OL,18,Fmaterial, such as the placenta or
OL,19,Fother birthing tissue of an animal
OL,20,Fwith the disease.
