OL,6,FTrump's comments on Wednesday follow
OL,7,Frepeated references to IVF on his
OL,8,Fcampaign trail. Earlier this year,
OL,9,FAlabama's Supreme Court ruled that
OL,10,Ffrozen embryos are children, and those
OL,11,Fwho destroy them can be held liable
OL,12,Ffor wrongful death.
OL,14,FFollowing this decision, Trump
OL,15,Fdistanced himself from the Alabama
OL,16,Fcase, and has since said he would put
OL,17,Fin place federal policy making IVF
OL,18,Ffree of charge.
