OL,6,FHere are a few facts and thoughts
OL,7,Fabout the EU youth mobility scheme,
OL,8,Fwhich Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes
OL,9,Fwould make the Office of Budget
OL,10,FResponsibility (OBR) less optimistic
OL,11,Fabout the outlook for UK growth - as
OL,12,Fper her interview in The Times.
OL,14,FFirstly, the scheme won't be agreed,
OL,15,Fformalised and implemented till 2027,
OL,16,Fat the earliest - and it would be hard
OL,17,Ffor any forecaster to bank the
OL,18,Fbenefits of a scheme whose parameters
OL,19,Fhaven't been set.

OL,6,FSecondly, my understanding is that,
OL,7,Finitially at least, it will be capped
OL,8,Fat less than the 50,000 people a year
OL,9,Fmentioned by Paul Johnson below - so
OL,10,FPaul's calculation that its impact on
OL,11,Fgrowth would be negligible may be
OL,12,Foverstating the case!
OL,14,FIt's a red herring in respect of the
OL,15,Fforthcoming budget.

OL,6,FIt comes against a backdrop of the
OL,7,Fgovernment trying to drive down net
OL,8,Fmigration, so if the OBR scores the EU
OL,9,Fmobility scheme as a tiny bit positive
OL,10,Fit may feel under pressure to score
OL,11,Fthe rest of the migration outlook even
OL,12,Fmore negatively in terms of impact on
OL,13,FGDP than it currently does.

OL,16,Fhole, which I explained on Tuesday, is
OL,17,Fmostly the consequence of the OBR
OL,18,Fdowngrading its forecast of the UK's

OL,6,FThe EU youth mobility scheme would
OL,7,Fhave zero bearing on productivity or
OL,8,Fthat #30bn budget black hole - and as
OL,9,Fa matter of theory, an influx of cheap
OL,10,Flabour tends to negatively affect
OL,11,Fproductivity, as businesses substitute
OL,12,Fcheap people for capital investment.

OL,17,Fnegative.
