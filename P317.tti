OL,5,FAs our old friend high pressure takes
OL,6,Fcontrol again, cloudless skies and
OL,7,Fstrong July sunshine will allow
OL,8,Ftemperatures to soar this weekend.
OL,10,FIt marks the third heatwave of the
OL,11,Fsummer so far, with amber heat health
OL,12,Falerts issued in parts of the country.
OL,14,FBut how is this heatwave different to
OL,15,Fthe last one?
OL,17,FLocation of peak heat
OL,19,FUsually peak temperatures are recorded
OL,20,Fin the south-east, but this time the
OL,21,Fhighest temperatures are further west.

OL,5,FThe last heatwave was very much

OL,10,FScotland and Northern Ireland had

OL,3,CWhy does this heatwave hit differently?
OL,5,FUnlike many of our heatwaves, the
OL,6,Fhumidity levels are slightly lower.
OL,8,FWe usually draw in hot, humid air from
OL,9,FEurope which has a huge influence on
OL,10,Fhow the heatwave feels.
OL,12,FThis time, it's more about "homegrown"
OL,13,Fheat - day-on-day heating from the
OL,14,Fstrength of the sunshine here alone.
OL,16,FThe humid air cannot be totally ruled
OL,17,Fout though. We're an island, and warm
OL,18,Fair can hold more moisture, so a muggy
OL,19,Ffeel will still exist for some of us.
