OL,7,FJoel Hills explains why Reeves' signal
OL,8,Fto change the fiscal rules in Labour's
OL,9,Fmanifesto is both a risky and radical
OL,10,Fmove
OL,12,FFiscal rules are guidelines a
OL,13,Fgovernment sets which regulate how
OL,14,Fmuch it can borrow and spend.
OL,16,FThey are designed to give a broad
OL,17,Fsense that the government is in
OL,18,Fcontrol of the things that matter, can
OL,19,Fbe trusted to borrow money and should
OL,20,Ftherefore pay the lowest interest
OL,21,Frates.

OL,12,Fchanging one of the fiscal rules in
