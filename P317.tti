OL,6,FIn spite of Elon Musk's personal
OL,7,Fattacks on the prime minister, and his
OL,8,Fendorsement of vicious criticism, I
OL,9,Funderstand that Keir Starmer is still
OL,10,Funwilling to engage in a direct
OL,11,Fargument with the world's richest
OL,12,Fperson and his social media platform.
OL,14,FTomorrow, however, I do expect Starmer
OL,15,Fto defend his record prosecuting child
OL,16,Fabusers as Director or Public
OL,17,FProsecutions and the determination of
OL,18,Fhis government to clamp down hard on
OL,19,Fit.

OL,6,FHe'll also talk about the importance
OL,7,Fof grounding political debate in
OL,8,Fverifiable fact.
OL,10,FMost of this, I assume, will be heard
OL,11,Fby Musk as water off his back, as it

OL,14,FI am not sure Starmer's appeal to
