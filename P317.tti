OL,3,CNewly evolved variant of mpox

OL,6,FScientists in England have found a new
OL,7,Fstrain of mpox.
OL,9,FThe new strain was found in a person
OL,10,Fwho had recently travelled to Asia,
OL,11,Fthe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)
OL,12,Fsaid.
OL,14,FOfficials said they identified a "new
OL,15,Frecombinant mpox virus", which means
OL,16,Fit has genetic material from different
OL,17,Fviral strains.
OL,19,FThe UKHSA said that genomic sequencing
OL,20,Fshowed that the mpox genome contained
OL,21,Felements of clade Ib and IIb mpox.
