OL,7,Fsaid we had entered 'phase two' of his
OL,8,Fgovernment. It was supposed to be
OL,9,Fabout "delivery". So far it has
OL,10,Fdelivered two humiliating
OL,11,Fresignations, a contentious reshuffle
OL,12,Fand sparked talk of a looming
OL,13,Fleadership challenge.
OL,15,FFirst, the reshuffle. As Labour MPs
OL,16,Freturned to Westminster on Monday and
OL,17,Ftook stock of who had moved where, it
OL,18,Fwas the new whips team that caught
OL,19,Ftheir eye.
