OL,6,FA political source I spoke with last
OL,7,Fnight told me there was fear of an
OL,8,Fattack further north, likely on Beirut.
OL,10,FBehind their thinking was the
OL,11,Fknowledge that Israel had gone ahead,
OL,12,Fearlier than planned, on the pager and
OL,13,Fwalkie-talkie plan.
OL,15,FOf course, Israel has neither
OL,16,Fconfirmed nor denied being
OL,17,Fresponsible, but my source advised
OL,18,Fthat the original thinking was to wait
OL,19,Flonger to target Hezbollah, so the
OL,20,Fattacks could be a precursor to a land
OL,21,Finvasion.
