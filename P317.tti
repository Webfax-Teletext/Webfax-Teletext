OL,7,Fthe mid-Atlantic and currently a
OL,8,Fcategory 3 storm, will continue its
OL,9,Fjourney towards Europe in the coming
OL,10,Fdays.
OL,12,FGabrielle had maximum sustained winds
OL,13,Fof 110 mph and was traveling northeast
OL,14,Fat 25 mph as the Meteorological
OL,15,FService of Portugal issued a warning.
OL,17,FBut what can people in Europe expect
OL,18,Fas the hurricane approaches, and how
OL,19,Flikely is it to impact weather in the

OL,8,Flose some strength and be downgraded
OL,9,Fin status as it approaches Portugal
OL,10,Fand Spain, but as a deep area of low
OL,11,Fpressure, it will still bring big,

OL,15,FHere in the UK, we're used to such
