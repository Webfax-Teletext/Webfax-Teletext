OL,11,Fweekend.
OL,13,FOver recent days, daytime highs have
OL,14,Fgenerally been around 6 to 8C. That's
OL,15,Fslightly below average, largely due to
OL,16,Fa lack of sunshine and a persistent
OL,17,Fsouth-easterly to easterly wind.

OL,7,FThis wind direction has been drawing
OL,8,Fin colder air, which has kept
OL,9,Fconditions feeling quite raw at times,
OL,10,Fespecially last weekend.
OL,12,FNow, that pattern is beginning to
OL,13,Fshift.
OL,15,FTemperatures this weekend are expected
OL,16,Fto climb into the 13 to 15C range,
OL,17,Fwhich will feel much more pleasant,
OL,18,Fparticularly if we catch a little

OL,3,CThis weekend could see warmest day of

OL,7,FThe reason for this change is the wind
OL,8,Fdirection. Instead of that colder
OL,9,Fsouth-easterly and easterly flow,
OL,10,Fwinds are turning more westerly. This
OL,11,Fallows milder air to move in and gives

OL,7,FThis weekend, temperatures could reach

OL,9,FIf that happens, it would make it the

OL,15,FAlthough temperatures are on the rise,
