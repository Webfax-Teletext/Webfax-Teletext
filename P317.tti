OL,3,CBye bye brown bananas - the lab hoping
OL,4,Cto keep your fruit salads fresh
OL,6,FIt's the perennial problem - once
OL,7,Fpeeled your banana begins to brown.
OL,9,FAnd you're left with an unappetising
OL,10,Fmush, more likely bound for the bin
OL,11,Fthan a fruit salad.
OL,13,FAt Tropic's lab in Norfolk they're
OL,14,Fpromising a scientific solution.
OL,16,FAccording to Cristina Pignocchi,
OL,17,FDirector of Banana Technology at
OL,18,FTropic, the company can "fast forward
OL,19,Fevolution so we do it in one year,
OL,20,Frather than thousands of years".

OL,6,FShe explained: "We know the genes
OL,7,Fresponsible for the browning of the
OL,8,Ffruit so we have modified these genes.
OL,9,FSo now (with) our non-browning bananas
OL,10,Fyou can cut them, blend them in
OL,11,Fmilkshakes or make fruit salads and
OL,12,Fthey will remain fresh and yellow for
OL,13,Fmuch longer than normal."
OL,15,FThis isn't just about making your
OL,16,Ffruit salad look more appealing.

OL,6,FBananas are the most eaten fruit in
OL,7,Fthe world, yet it's estimated 50% of
OL,8,Fthem get thrown away. In the UK that
OL,9,Fequates to 1.4m bananas going in the

OL,12,FNon-browning bananas are already
OL,13,Faccepted for sale in America and
OL,14,FCanada - they could be legal here soon

OL,17,F"precision breeding", but not
OL,18,Fgenetically modified (GM) crops.
