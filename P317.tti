OL,6,FA report by the World Meteorological
OL,7,FOrganisation (WMO) has said 2024 was
OL,8,Fofficially the hottest year since
OL,9,Frecords began.
OL,11,FTheir report, released on Wednesday,
OL,12,Fset out a series of stark warnings as
OL,13,Fwell as detailing some of the economic
OL,14,Fand social impacts caused by a hotter
OL,15,Fplanet.
OL,17,FIn what the WMO says should be a "wake-
OL,18,Fup call", the report also confirms
OL,19,Fthat 2024 was the first year where
OL,20,Fglobal temperatures were higher than
OL,21,F1.5C.
