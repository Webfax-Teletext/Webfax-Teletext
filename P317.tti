OL,3,CMark Ruffalo backs Harris but tells
OL,4,CITV News of his reservations over Gaza
OL,6,FRuffalo's argument - his hope - is
OL,7,Fthat if Harris is elected president
OL,8,Fshe will be different and Muslim
OL,9,FAmericans will be able to influence
OL,10,Fher once she's in the White House.
OL,12,FThe reason that Ruffalo's position is
OL,13,Fso important for Democrats is that
OL,14,FHarris is haemorrhaging support among
OL,15,FArab Americans and Muslim voters, due
OL,16,Fto the administration's position on
OL,17,FGaza.
OL,19,FThere are 300,000 Muslim voters in
OL,20,FPhiladelphia alone.
