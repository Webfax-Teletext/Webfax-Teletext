OL,7,FThis morning, the Office for National
OL,8,FStatistics confirmed that the headline
OL,9,Fannual rate of inflation in the UK
OL,10,Fheld steady at 2.2% in August, just
OL,11,Fabove the Bank of England's target
OL,12,Frate.
OL,14,FThe market view is the Bank will sit
OL,15,Fon its hands tomorrow, keeping
OL,16,Finterest rates at 5%.
OL,18,FNone of which feels very exciting but
OL,19,Fbeneath the hood, there are things to
