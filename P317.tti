OL,7,FHere are some tips from the bodies to

OL,9,Fscams:
OL,11,F1. Be aware of anyone on a moped or
OL,12,Fmotorcycle who is lingering
OL,13,Funnecessarily or trying to hide out of
OL,14,Fsight at the end or side of a road or
OL,15,Fbehind parked vehicles.
OL,17,F2. The moped scammer may drive head-on
OL,18,Finto their victim's vehicle and then
OL,19,Fthrow their moped down and even drop
OL,20,Fto the floor to fake an injury, before
OL,21,Ftaking photos of the incident.
