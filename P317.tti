OL,8,FJanuary sales can be a good time to
OL,9,Fgrab bargains, but it's also a popular
OL,10,Ftime for rogue retailers, who try to
OL,11,Fscam unsuspecting shoppers and pocket
OL,12,Ftheir hard-earned cash.
OL,14,F"To avoid being caught out, check the
OL,15,Fweb address before making a purchase
OL,16,Fto ensure that it is legitimate and
OL,17,Fmatches the shop you're looking to buy
OL,18,Ffrom, especially if you opened the

OL,11,FHere are some tips from Mr Evans to

OL,6,F2. If the retailer does not respond or
OL,7,Frefuses to refund you, report the
OL,8,Ftransaction to your bank. Many will
OL,9,Fallow you to report transactions
OL,10,Fonline in your mobile banking app.
OL,12,F3. If you have paid by card, you could
OL,13,Fask your bank to file a chargeback
