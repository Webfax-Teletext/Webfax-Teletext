OL,6,FIn a ruling on Friday, Mr Justice

OL,8,Fsaying there was a "plainly

OL,11,Fdelaying" a full trial by up to two

OL,14,F"That is unsatisfactory," he said.
OL,16,FAt a hearing on Wednesday, lawyers for
OL,17,FNGN said the court should first
OL,18,Fdetermine whether those bringing cases
OL,19,Fcould have known they had a
