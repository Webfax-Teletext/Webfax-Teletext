OL,6,FThe welfare U-turn is an expensive one.
OL,8,FProtecting existing Pip claimants is
OL,9,Fexpected to cost an extra #1.5bn a

OL,11,FCredit Health element and other

OL,14,FSo this is a #3bn U-turn.
OL,16,FAnd it has to be added to this month's
OL,17,Ffirst u-turn, the one on winter fuel
OL,18,Fpayments. That's thought to have cost
OL,19,Fanother #1.5bn.

OL,6,FPerhaps in order to keep backbenchers
OL,7,Fonside with his welfare reforms, the
OL,8,Fprime minister has strongly hinted
OL,9,Fthat he agrees with them that the two
OL,10,Fchild benefit cap should be scrapped.
OL,12,FBut having forced the PM to partly
OL,13,Fabandon his welfare reforms they may
OL,14,Fbe unlikely to let him off the hook on
OL,15,Fthe two child cap.
OL,17,FScrapping is estimated to be worth
OL,18,Fanother #3.5bn.

OL,11,FNo wonder economists think she may be
