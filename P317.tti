OL,7,FThe hurricane has downgraded from
OL,8,Fcategory 5 strength, to a category 4.
OL,9,FThis initially sounds like positive
OL,10,Fnews, but it does not mean there will
OL,11,Fbe a significant decline in the risk
OL,12,Fto life.
OL,14,FCategories are based on wind speeds,
OL,15,Fwhich have recently dropped to 145mph.
OL,16,FHowever, hurricanes weaken very
OL,17,Fslowly, so the storm surge is expected
OL,18,Fto remain the same as when it was
OL,19,Fcategory 5.
