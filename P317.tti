OL,7,FThe National Association of Funeral
OL,8,FDirectors (NAFD) has called for a
OL,9,F"workable solution" to respectfully
OL,10,Fdeal with the ashes of up to 300,000
OL,11,Fpeople left unclaimed at funeral
OL,12,Fparlours across the UK.
OL,14,FThe organisation said the large number
OL,15,Fpresents a growing challenge for
OL,16,Ffuneral directors who often struggle
OL,17,Fwith limited storage capacity to hold
OL,18,Fthe ashes long-term.

OL,7,FAlthough the exact figure is not
OL,8,Fknown, the NAFD estimates between
OL,9,F250,000 and 300,000 sets of ashes
OL,10,Fremain unclaimed.
OL,12,FReasons ashes are not claimed can
OL,13,Fvary, the NAFD said, from family

OL,15,Fscatter two sets of ashes together.
OL,17,FIn response, the Law Commission has
OL,18,Fbeen reviewing burial and cremation
