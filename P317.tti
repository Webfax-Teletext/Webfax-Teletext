OL,8,F"There is no doubt that the claimant
OL,9,Fwas subject to sexual abuse of the
OL,10,Fmost serious kind by the defendant
OL,11,Fwhen she was only 12 years old and

OL,16,Fbrought the legal action after being
OL,17,Frepeatedly raped and sexually
OL,18,Fassaulted by Glitter, as well as being
OL,19,F"humiliated and coercively controlled"
OL,20,Fby him.
