OL,6,FIt is the work of researchers in
OL,7,FJapan, who say they have discovered a
OL,8,Fnew way to bind living skin tissue to
OL,9,Fa mechanical robotic surface.
OL,11,FThe team was led by Professor Shoji
OL,12,FTakeuchi, of the Institute of
OL,13,FIndustrial Science at the University
OL,14,Fof Tokyo.
OL,16,FPreviously he used collagen, a fibrous
OL,17,Fprotein in human skin, and human
OL,18,Fdermal fibroblasts - the main cell
OL,19,Ftype in connective tissue to make up
OL,20,Fthe pink skin.

OL,6,FThe new method allows the skin to be
OL,7,Fadhered onto a surface "very nicely,
OL,8,Fso that it does not detach easily and
OL,9,Fforms a very good interface between
OL,10,Fthe rigid and soft," Yifan Wang, an
OL,11,Fassistant professor at the school of
OL,12,Fmechanical and aerospace engineering
OL,13,Fat Nanyang Technological University,

OL,6,FFor him, the most exciting
OL,7,Fimplications of this research are
OL,8,Faround developments in the "sensing
OL,9,Fcapability of robots".
OL,11,F"Our human skin has these very

OL,13,Fsurface, which currently you can still
OL,14,Fnot quite achieve using some synthetic
OL,15,Fmaterials," Mr Wang told CNN.
OL,17,F"(But) if we use biological skin on
OL,18,Fthose traditional robots, we can
OL,19,Fachieve a similar type of sensing of
OL,20,Fdifferent features."
