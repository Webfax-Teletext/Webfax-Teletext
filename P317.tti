OL,3,CLive facial recognition: Why is Asda's
OL,4,Ctrial of the technology causing a stir?
OL,6,FThe tech is being trialled in five
OL,7,Fstores across Greater Manchester
OL,9,FSupermarket chain Asda has launched a
OL,10,Ftrial of live facial recognition,
OL,11,Fwhere shoppers in some stores will
OL,12,Fhave their faces scanned in a bid to
OL,13,Freduce retail crime.
OL,15,FAsda has said it is in response to a
OL,16,Fgrowing number of incidents where
OL,17,Fstaff have been threatened and
OL,18,Fattacked - but campaigners have
OL,19,Fbranded the trial "disproportionate"
OL,20,Fand "chilling".
