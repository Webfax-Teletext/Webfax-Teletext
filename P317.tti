OL,6,FIt hasn't worked out. The mildly
OL,7,Fgrowing economy they inherited in July
OL,8,Fhas reverted to flat-lining type,
OL,9,Fpartly because Rachel Reeves and
OL,10,FAngela Rayner have heaped additional
OL,11,Fcosts on businesses, with their #25bn
OL,12,Femployer national insurance increase
OL,13,Fand a raft of new employment
OL,14,Frestrictions.
OL,16,FThey said they wanted the engine of
OL,17,Fthe economy to be turbocharged and
OL,18,Fthen filled it with syrup.
