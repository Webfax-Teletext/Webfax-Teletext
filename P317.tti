OL,6,FThe images from Minneapolis in recent
OL,7,Fdays have been searing and disturbing.
OL,9,FThey have been played on a loop by
OL,10,Fcable news networks and have been
OL,11,Fricocheting around America on social
OL,12,Fmedia platforms.
OL,14,FThe mobile phone videos of federal

OL,17,Ftheir way into Democratic party TV ads

OL,8,Freferred to ICE agents as "militia

OL,11,FSo the question is whether this is a

OL,15,Fimmigrant round-ups and deportations,
OL,16,Fhas gone too far.
OL,18,FTrump is certain to argue today at his

OL,6,FWe will fully understand how Americans

OL,8,Fto the polls in the midterm elections.
OL,10,FOn November 3, voters will decide who
