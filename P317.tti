OL,6,F"The meteor shower slowly builds up
OL,7,Ffrom mid July to then reach its peak
OL,8,Factivity at 100 per hour on August 12.
OL,9,FIt then reduces until the mid-end of

OL,12,FHowever, in reality, the activity can
OL,13,Fshow more complex variation which
OL,14,Fmeans the peak might not be the only

OL,17,F"The years 2018 and 2020 had some

OL,19,Fthe main peak," Professor Brown said.
