OL,3,CLabour government will ban gay and

OL,6,FPart of the reason is that there has
OL,7,Fbeen intense debate in recent years in
OL,8,Frelation to banning so-called trans
OL,9,Fconversion therapy.
OL,11,FSome of that is about the broader
OL,12,Fdebate to do with sex and gender,
OL,13,Fwhich rages at high temperatures and
OL,14,Foften sparks angry exchanges.
