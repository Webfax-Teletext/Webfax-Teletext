OL,7,FCatholic Church, it is a daunting task
OL,8,Ffor the 133 cardinal electors, who
OL,9,Fcome from 70 different countries.
OL,11,FThat is because sexual abuse and
OL,12,Ffinancial scandals have harmed the
OL,13,Fchurch's reputation, and there are
OL,14,Ftrends which are turning people away
OL,15,Ffrom organised religion in many parts
OL,16,Fof the world. The Vatican is also
OL,17,Fstruggling with financial issues.
