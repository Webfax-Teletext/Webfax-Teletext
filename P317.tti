OL,6,FRobert Jenrick is "clearly still
OL,7,Frunning a leadership campaign," Sir
OL,8,FKeir Starmer said, after the senior
OL,9,FConservative MP complained he "didn't
OL,10,Fsee another white face" during a visit
OL,11,Fto an area of Birmingham.
OL,13,FThe Prime Minister said the Government
OL,14,Fneeded "no lessons" on integration
OL,15,Ffrom the shadow justice secretary,
OL,16,Fafter the claims he made during a 90-
OL,17,Fminute visit to Handsworth earlier
OL,18,Fthis year came to light.
