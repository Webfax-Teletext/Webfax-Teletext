OL,9,FFrom Monday, June 10, cat owners could
OL,10,Fface a fine of up to #500 if they fail
OL,11,Fto microchip their pet.
OL,13,FThe new legislation makes cat
OL,14,Fmicrochipping compulsory in order to
OL,15,Fmake it easier for lost or stray pet
OL,16,Fcats to be reunited with their owners.
OL,18,FThere are more than nine million pet
OL,19,Fcats in England, but as many as 2.3
OL,20,Fmillion of those are unchipped.

OL,9,Fthere have been calls from animal

OL,13,FOwners should keep a note of their

OL,7,FOnly a trained professional can fit a

OL,10,Fto microchip their cat.
OL,12,FWhat is microchipping and how much

OL,15,FThe RSPCA says microchipping gives a

OL,7,FUnlike a collar, which can be removed,
OL,8,Fthe microchip is inserted under the
OL,9,Fpet's skin, and gives them a unique

OL,12,FCharity Cat's Protection says the

OL,14,Fquick and no more painful than an
OL,15,Finjection. They say there is no need
OL,16,Ffor recovery time after the procedure.
OL,18,FThe microchip, which is about the size
OL,19,Fof a grain of rice, can be scanned and

OL,12,FChief Veterinary Officer Christine

OL,15,Fway of identifying lost pets".
OL,17,F"As we've seen with dog microchipping,

OL,15,FWhat happens if you don't microchip?
