OL,6,FPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly
OL,7,Fsaid the United States needs to take

OL,9,F"international security".
OL,11,FThese claims were reinforced in the

OL,8,FIt is also very mineral rich, but
OL,9,Fthat's not the main reason Trump is so

OL,5,FTrump floated the idea of buying

OL,10,FIn December, the then president-elect
