OL,6,FIf you think of people who fish, most
OL,7,Fof us will probably imagine fishermen.
OL,8,FBut in Galicia in north-western Spain,
OL,9,Fit's the women who dominate a
OL,10,Fparticular trade.
OL,12,FThey're Mariscadoras, or Shell-
OL,13,Ffisherwomen. For a thousand years,
OL,14,Fthese women have passed down
OL,15,Ftraditional skills from generation to
OL,16,Fgeneration.
OL,18,FGrandmothers, mothers and daughters
OL,19,Fhave all grown up with this trade
OL,20,Ftouching every aspect of their lives.

OL,9,Fthis work which they fiercely protect
OL,10,Ffor the next generation.
OL,12,FMany of their methods are unchanged in
OL,13,Fhundreds of years, but what is

OL,10,Fspecies of shell fish harvested in the

OL,11,F"It happens to farmers, sailors and
