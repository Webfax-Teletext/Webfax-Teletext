OL,11,FShe has been in frontline politics

OL,6,FWhat's gone wrong, and what can
OL,7,FStarmer do?
OL,9,FOne problem for them is that - less
OL,10,Fthan a year into the life of this
OL,11,Fparliament - too many of his MPs are
OL,12,Ftired of being treated like cattle,
OL,13,Fand are depressed by that they see as
OL,14,FStarmer's lack of optimistic purpose.
OL,15,FAs several said to me, they feel
OL,16,Fexploited and taken for granted.
OL,18,FHere is how one grumpy MP laid the
OL,19,Fblame at the PM's door: "He's never
OL,20,Fhere. He never votes. And his team
OL,21,Fpatronise and infantalise us."
