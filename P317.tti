OL,6,FThe economic outlook for autumn looks
OL,7,Fbleak and tax rises likely, as ITV
OL,8,FNews Economics Editor Joel Hills
OL,9,Fexplains.
OL,11,FThe government borrowed #20.7 billion
OL,12,Fin June - #6.6 billion more than the
OL,13,Fsame month last year, and far above
OL,14,Fthe #16.5 billion City economists had
OL,15,Fforecast.
OL,17,FIn fact, it was the second highest
OL,18,FJune borrowing figure on record,
OL,19,Faccording to the Office for National
OL,20,FStatistics, which began tracking
OL,21,Fmonthly borrowing in 1993.

OL,6,FOn the face of it, the detail is as
OL,7,Ftroubling as the headline number.
OL,9,FJune's numbers look dreadful. But
OL,10,Fdespite the overshoot, borrowing for
OL,11,Fthe first quarter of the financial
OL,12,Fyear (April`June) is more or less bang
OL,13,Fin line with the OBR's forecast.

OL,6,FCapital Economics warns that the

OL,8,Fplanned welfare cuts - and its
OL,9,Fassumption that borrowing will
OL,10,Fcontinue to overshoot - means the
OL,11,Fchancellor will need to find #15`25

OL,14,F"We doubt the gilt market will
