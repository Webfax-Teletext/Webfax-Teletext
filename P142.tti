OL,6,GNext week marks the 25th anniversary
OL,7,Gof the end of the original run of what
OL,8,Gwas then called the ITN News at Ten.
OL,10,FThe controversy which surrounded the
OL,11,Fdecision is a reminder of another age.
OL,13,FSome ITV companies argued for the move
OL,14,Fas soon as the network was deregulated
OL,15,Fin 1993.
OL,17,FBut it took the ITC five years to
OL,18,Fallow what was initially a one-year
OL,19,Fexperiment.

OL,3,CBBC One and ITV 1 News at Ten: the

OL,6,FSo on 5th March 1999, the ITN Early
OL,7,FEvening News at 5.40pm and ITN News at
OL,8,FTen came to end. The following Monday
OL,9,Fthe ITV Evening News at 6.30pm and the
OL,10,FITV Nightly News at 11pm got underway.
OL,12,FBut, of course, we all know how it
OL,13,Fturned out. It wasn't pretty for ITV.

OL,6,FThe BBC ` during a competitive period
OL,7,Funder Greg Dyke ` moved the BBC News
OL,8,Fat Nine back by an hour. The original
OL,9,Fplan to do this in the autumn of 2001
OL,10,Fwas abandoned and instead put into
OL,11,Faction at breakneck speed. The BBC
OL,12,Fprogramme launched in October 2000.
OL,14,FIn 2004 ITV put up the white flag and
OL,15,Fmoved its late news back to 10.30pm.
OL,17,FThen Michael Grade, as ITV's executive

OL,6,FInitially its format copied the

OL,8,Faped those of 1988 and Trevor McDonald
OL,9,Fbriefly came out of retirement.
OL,11,FIt is all a sorry saga. The ITC, in
OL,12,Fretrospect, should not have allowed
OL,13,FNews at Ten to end in 1999.
OL,15,FBut we are where we are. Linear news

OL,17,Fsince then.
OL,19,FITV's commitment to the scheduling of
