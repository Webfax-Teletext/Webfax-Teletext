OL,6,GOfcom's decision to make no changes
OL,7,Gfor now to the rules covering the
OL,8,Gamount of advertising on ITV 1,
OL,9,GChannel 4 and Channel 5 is a huge
OL,10,Gsurprise.
OL,12,FThe regulator had been minded to
OL,13,Fallow the channels to show as much
OL,14,Fadvertising as other commercial
OL,15,Fbroadcasters.
OL,17,FIn other words, there could have been

OL,10,FSo what changed?
OL,12,FITV, STV and Channel 4 wanted the

OL,6,FBy my calculations, it is possible
OL,7,Fthe ITV Lunchtime News might have
OL,8,Flost 90 seconds. Ad breaks in the
OL,9,F10pm hour could have led to
OL,10,Fscheduling changes but would not
OL,11,Fnecessarily cut the overall duration

OL,14,FThe biggest change would have been
OL,15,Fthe potential for an extra 6 minutes
OL,16,Fand 30 seconds of ads during a
OL,17,Ftypical evening in the 6pm hour.
