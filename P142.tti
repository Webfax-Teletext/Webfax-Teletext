OL,6,GA subtle change seems to have been
OL,7,Gmade to UTV's promotions for local
OL,8,Gprogrammes.
OL,10,FThey now seem to be routinely
OL,11,Freferring to ITV X orally.
OL,13,FFor example, they might end with words
OL,14,Fsuch as: "Dogs with Jobs, coming soon
OL,15,Fon UTV and ITV X."
OL,17,FThis is in line with the practice on
OL,18,Fnetwork promotions and, indeed, the
OL,19,Fpractice on some rival channels.

OL,10,FThe visual reference to UTV comes

OL,12,FBut all these names clearly exist
