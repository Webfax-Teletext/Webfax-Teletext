OL,6,G1996 Channel 4 replaces its long-
OL,7,Grunning idents with a new concept
OL,8,Gbased around four circles, created by
OL,9,Gits in-house design team. The '4'
OL,10,Glost its familiar colour scheme and
OL,11,Gwas significantly reduced in size.
OL,12,GEach circle signified something
OL,13,Gdifferent about the channel's
OL,14,Gprogrammes: one of the circles would
OL,15,Galways contain the channel
OL,16,Gidentification - the '4'; another
OL,17,Gwould show the time at which the
OL,18,Gprogramme was to be transmitted; a
OL,19,Gthird circle showed an image which
OL,20,Gclearly identified the programme; the
OL,21,Gfinal circle (not always used) was
OL,22,Gsupposed to signify the first thing
OL,23,Gthat came to mind when you thought
OL,24,Gabout this programme.JThe full
OL,25,Gconcept was only realised on
OL,26,Gpromotional trail endboards and
