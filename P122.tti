OL,6,G2002 Regional ITV brands are dropped
OL,7,Gin favour of ITV 1 branding in
OL,8,GEngland, Wales, the Scottish Borders
OL,9,Gand the Channel Islands. Continuity/
OL,10,Gplayout is centralised in London, for
OL,11,Gall Carlton and Granada-owned
OL,12,Gfranchises (Wales retained their own
OL,13,Gcontinuity announcements and used 'ITV
OL,14,G1 Wales' branding). UTV adopted the
OL,15,Gnew national on-screen presentation,
OL,16,Galbeit with UTV branding - and they
OL,17,Glater introduced their own take on the
OL,18,Gnational idents, featuring local
OL,19,Gtalent. STV and Grampian would also
OL,20,Gadopt the celebrity-based OSP from 6th
OL,21,GJanuary 2003 - and like UTV, they also
OL,22,Gused local presenters in their idents.
OL,23,GSome longstanding regional brands were
OL,24,Gstill used prior to local programming:
OL,25,GAnglia, Border, Carlton, Channel,
OL,26,GGranada, Meridian, Tyne Tees, and
