OL,6,G1996 Channel 4 replaces its long-
OL,7,Grunning idents with a new concept
OL,8,Gbased around four circles, created by
OL,9,Gits in-house design team. The '4' lost
OL,10,Gits familiar colour scheme and was
OL,11,Gsignificantly reduced in size.JEach
OL,12,Gcircle signified something different
OL,13,Gabout the channel's programmes: one of
OL,14,Gthe circles would always contain the
OL,15,Gchannel identification - the '4';
OL,16,Ganother would show the time at which
OL,17,Gthe programme was to be transmitted; a
OL,18,Gthird circle showed an image which
OL,19,Gclearly identified the programme; the
OL,20,Gfinal circle (not always used) was
OL,21,Gsupposed to signify the first thing
OL,22,Gthat came to mind when you thought
OL,23,Gabout this programme.JThe full concept
OL,24,Gwas only realised on promotional trail
OL,25,Gendboards and programme slides; on the
OL,26,Gchannel's idents, three of the circles
