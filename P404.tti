OL,6,FRacquets Manager Jon Lee said new
OL,7,Fplayers loved the game because the
OL,8,Fbasics were quick to learn.
OL,10,F"I think that padel has become popular
OL,11,Fbecause it's a lot easier to pick up
OL,12,Fthan a lot of other racquet sports,"
OL,13,FJon said.
OL,15,F"With tennis we have a lot of complex
OL,16,Fgrips, a lot of changes and a lot of
OL,17,Fpositions to play your shots.
OL,19,F"With padel you can put somebody in a
OL,20,Fso-called shake-hands grip in a much
OL,21,Fsmaller court.

OL,14,FThe courts are designed for doubles
