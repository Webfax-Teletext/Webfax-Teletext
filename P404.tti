OL,6,FToday, the Prime Minister has promised
OL,7,Fmore police on the streets in an
OL,8,Fattempt to tackle community issues
OL,9,Flike shoplifting and burglary.
OL,11,FKeir Starmer said: "These are
OL,12,Fadditional officers. And what's really
OL,13,Fimportant is the way in which they're
OL,14,Fgoing about their business, the
OL,15,Faccountability...every community will
OL,16,Fbe able to hold them to account, see
OL,17,Fhow their team is doing and to ask
OL,18,Fquestions and make requests and
OL,19,Fdemands of them.

OL,6,F"The vast majority of people do worry

OL,15,FStephanie, however, says she no longer
