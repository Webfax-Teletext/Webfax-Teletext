OL,6,FThe enormously popular sitcom, which
OL,7,Fbegan in 1981, follows the lives of
OL,8,Fthe Trotter brothers and their far-
OL,9,Ffrom-straightforward path from rags to
OL,10,Friches. Over the course of seven
OL,11,Fseries and several Christmas specials,
OL,12,Fthe Trotters tried various get-rich-
OL,13,Fquick schemes, buying low-quality or
OL,14,Fsometimes black-market goods and
OL,15,Fselling them at the market.
OL,17,FJust like the Trotter brothers, "we
OL,18,Falways tried to make profit and
OL,19,Fregardless of how many times we
OL,20,Ffailed, we just moved on," Tarik Fatic
OL,21,Fsaid.
