OL,7,FTransport for London is still
OL,8,Fsuffering the impact of a cyber attack
OL,9,Fwith passengers waiting for refunds
OL,10,Fand some age groups missing out on
OL,11,Ffree travel.
OL,13,FSadiq Khan said a 'big' number of
OL,14,Fpassengers were out of pocket but
OL,15,Fthose worst affected would be
OL,16,Fprioritised for refunds.
OL,18,F"So the figure is big in relation to
OL,19,Fthe number of people who've paid a
OL,20,Ffare but shouldn't have paid a fare,"

OL,7,F"TfL, when it comes to return to
OL,8,Fnormal business, is prioritising those
OL,9,Fpassengers first.
OL,11,F"He'll (Neil Garrett, Conservative
OL,12,FLondon Assembley Member) also be aware
OL,13,Fof the issue about Zipcards and other
OL,14,Fissues.
OL,16,F"So the the way TfL is working is to
OL,17,Fmake sure those commuters who are out
OL,18,Fof pocket can be resolved first.
OL,20,F"So it's triage. The mission has
OL,21,Fbegun," Mr Khan explained.
