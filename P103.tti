OL,7,FOn 1 October, 1924, Elsie Gladys
OL,8,FSpooner was born into a very
OL,9,Fdifferent world. Not least a world in
OL,10,Fwhich monarchs did not reign for 70
OL,11,Fyears, and were all men.
OL,13,FElsie is my grandma, and as we sit
OL,14,Ftogether in her front room she
OL,15,Fremembers the kings, the Queen, and
OL,16,Freminisces about the war days. They
OL,17,Fmay be memories from a bygone age,
OL,18,Fbut the pomp and ceremony around the
OL,19,Fdeath of a monarch and the crowning
OL,20,Fof a new one has not changed.
OL,3,C'I've seen 4 kings in my life, we
OL,4,Cdon't need another coronation as
OL,5,Cpeople struggle with bills'
