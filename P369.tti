OL,6,F"I was quite a mess," he said. "(My

OL,9,FI was hot I was cold. I hadn't been to

OL,12,FHe saw a doctor who told him the
OL,13,Finfection could affect his heart.
OL,15,F"The symptoms were characteristic of
OL,16,Fsepsis - I was hot, I was cold, I
OL,17,Fwasn't eating or drinking that much
OL,18,Fand I was a little delirious."

OL,6,FSepsis is a type of blood poisoning
OL,7,Fthat occurs when the immune system
OL,8,Freacts to an infection. It attacks
OL,9,Forgans and tissues within the body. If
OL,10,Fnot treated immediately, it can result
OL,11,Fin organ failure and death.
OL,13,FMr Clayton's brother, Mark, said it
OL,14,Fwas a frightening time.
OL,16,FHe said: "It shook the whole family
OL,17,Freally, I was pleased I was there to
OL,18,Fbe there for him while he got on the
OL,19,Froad to recovery."

OL,6,FIntensive care consultant Dr Ron

OL,8,Fone in five people who develop sepsis
OL,9,Fdo not survive.
OL,11,FHe added: "Even among survivors there
OL,12,Fcan be life changing consequences.
OL,13,FThat might include amputation, but it
OL,14,Fcan certainly include psychological
OL,15,Fafter effects and physical after
