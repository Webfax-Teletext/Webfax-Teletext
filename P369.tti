OL,6,FAndy Webber, of Bridlington RNLI,
OL,7,Fsaid: "The RNLI encourages people not
OL,8,Fto bring lilos to the beach, they are
OL,9,Fbright, colourful and fun, but they
OL,10,Fare really only meant for a swimming
OL,11,Fpool, or any water area that is
OL,12,Fsurrounded by a wall.
OL,14,F"As a result, they can easily be blown
OL,15,Fout to sea, as has happened on this
OL,16,Foccasion. We do encourage people to
OL,17,Fcome to the seaside but would ask you
OL,18,Fto please leave all inflatables at
OL,19,Fhome."
