OL,6,FIn his defence, Motin, aged 59, has
OL,7,Fsaid he pressed the wrong button by
OL,8,Fmistake when he tried to take the
OL,9,FSolong out of autopilot and steer away
OL,10,Ffrom the Stena Immaculate from one
OL,11,Fnautical mile away.
OL,13,FNot realising the error, he has told
OL,14,Fjurors that he proceeded to stop and
OL,15,Frestart the steering gear to no
OL,16,Feffect, thinking the Solong could have
OL,17,Fdeveloped a rudder fault experienced
OL,18,Fby sister ship, Sanskip Express.
