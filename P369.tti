OL,5,F"We think the head had been
OL,6,Fdeliberately removed because of the
OL,7,Fclean nature of the cut and the fact
OL,8,Fthe body was inside a bag meant it
OL,9,Fwould have been less likely to have

OL,12,FShe said missing skin around the male
OL,13,Fdog's shoulder indicated the culprit
OL,14,Fmay have attempted to remove its
OL,15,Fmicrochip.
OL,17,FIt had been wrapped in a black plastic
OL,18,Fbag and left in shallow water.
