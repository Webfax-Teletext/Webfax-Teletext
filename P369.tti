OL,6,FAt a hearing in February 2025, the
OL,7,FParole Board again considered whether
OL,8,Fhe could be released or moved to an
OL,9,Fopen prison.
OL,11,FIt heard that Farrow, who is now 63,
OL,12,Fhad undertaken accredited programmes
OL,13,Fin prison to address his sexual
OL,14,Foffending as well as one-on-one
OL,15,Fsessions with a psychologist.
OL,17,FThe panel heard he had "developed
OL,18,Finsight into his risk factors and had
OL,19,Fgained skills in custody linked to his
OL,20,Femotional management and problem
OL,21,Fsolving."

OL,10,FIn its conclusion, the Parole Board
OL,11,Fsaid: "The panel noted that the index
OL,12,Foffences was a brutal, sexual, and
OL,13,Fviolent attack.
OL,15,F"Although Mr Farrow had completed
OL,16,Fextensive work in custody to explore
OL,17,Fhis offending behaviour, the panel
OL,18,Fconsidered that it was only his recent
OL,19,Fwork that had allowed professionals to
OL,20,Fsay that he had shown insight into his
OL,21,Foffending.
