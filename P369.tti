OL,6,FLocal residents are fed up with a lack
OL,7,Fof action in tackling the blight of
OL,8,Ffly-tipping on a rural street in East
OL,9,FYorkshire.
OL,11,FOrchard Park Road in Cottingham has
OL,12,Fbecome a hot-spot for dumped waste
OL,13,Fsuch as mattresses, toys, radiators
OL,14,Fand industrial waste. Radiators. On a
OL,15,Fvisit to the site by ITV News, a
OL,16,Frocking horse had been left.
OL,18,FLocal resident Andrew Kirby told ITV
OL,19,FNews: "Because of a lack of cameras in
OL,20,Fthe area it has become an easy drop-
OL,21,Foff zone."
