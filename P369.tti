OL,7,Fdamages after doctors caused long-
OL,8,Flasting damage to her bowel during
OL,9,Fsurgery to remove her gallbladder.
OL,11,FCheryl Gravil, from Doncaster,
OL,12,Fsuffered the injury during what should
OL,13,Fhave been a routine operation at
OL,14,FDoncaster Royal Infirmary in 2017.
OL,16,FMedics initially failed to realise
OL,17,Fwhat had happened. It was only after
OL,18,Fshe complained of feeling unwell that
OL,19,Fthe problem was diagnosed.

OL,6,FHaving initially been told she would
OL,7,Fspend less than a day in hospital, Ms
OL,8,FGravil instead spent four months
OL,9,Fbattling sepsis, pneumonia and a

OL,12,F"I was later told that I'd have only
OL,13,Fsurvived another couple hours had I
OL,14,Fnot been admitted to intensive care
OL,15,Fwhen I was," she said.
OL,17,FFollowing her initial operation,
OL,18,Fnurses told Ms Gravil that it was
OL,19,Fcommon to feel unwell and she was
OL,20,Flikely experiencing wind.
