OL,6,FAbout 40,000 "love locks" have been
OL,7,Ftransported to the country estate
OL,8,Fwhere they will go on display after
OL,9,Fbeing saved from the scrapheap.
OL,11,FThe padlocks, inscribed with messages
OL,12,Fcelebrating relationships or
OL,13,Fremembering loved ones, had been fixed
OL,14,Fto the Weir footbridge in Bakewell,
OL,15,FDerbyshire, over the years since 2011.
OL,17,FBut when a major repair project was
OL,18,Fannounced to start in September,
OL,19,FDerbyshire County Council warned the
OL,20,Flocks would be scrapped unless people
OL,21,Freturned to remove them.
