OL,6,FAshfield had its fair share of
OL,7,Fpolitical drama before this election
OL,8,Fcampaign even began.
OL,10,FIn March, then Ashfield MP Lee
OL,11,FAnderson defected from the
OL,12,FConservative Party and joined Reform
OL,13,FUK.
OL,15,FHe had been Deputy Chair of the Tory
OL,16,FParty, but resigned from that role
OL,17,Fover the Rwanda Plan, which he wanted
OL,18,Fto be stricter.
OL,20,FMr Anderson chose not to hold a by-
OL,21,Felection when he changed Party.

OL,6,FThroughout the day, we spoke to a

OL,10,FLee Anderson's name came up more than

OL,14,FOf course, that's just the handful of
