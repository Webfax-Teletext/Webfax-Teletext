OL,6,FDr Stephen Kelly, chair of the BMA's
OL,7,Fconsultants committee in Wales, said:
OL,8,F"This has been an incredibly difficult
OL,9,Fdecision. No doctor wants to strike,
OL,10,Fbut the conditions now faced in the
OL,11,Fworkplace caused by the extreme
OL,12,Fpressures on the service and unsafe
OL,13,Fstaffing levels have left doctors with
OL,14,Fno choice.
OL,16,F"Colleagues are now choosing to retire
OL,17,Fearly, reduce their hours or move out
OL,18,Fof Wales where pay is competitive, and
OL,19,Fwards better staffed.
