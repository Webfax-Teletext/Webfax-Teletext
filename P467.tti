OL,9,FOn the door of a vape shop in Cardiff,
OL,10,Fthere is a large poster which tells me
OL,11,Funder 18s will not be served.
OL,13,FThat isn't strictly true though. It is
OL,14,Fillegal in Wales to sell under-18s
OL,15,Fvapes or tobacco, but there's another
OL,16,Fproduct for sale in this shop that

OL,7,FSimon Clark, director of Forest, said:
OL,8,F"Nicotine pouches should only be used
OL,9,Fby adults so we would welcome a ban on
OL,10,Ftheir sale to anyone under the age of
OL,11,F18. This should be enforced in the

OL,13,Fanyone selling nicotine pouches to

OL,16,F"It is important however not to

OL,18,Fevidence suggests they offer a reduced
OL,19,Frisk alternative to cigarettes that is
OL,20,Fhelpful to smokers who are trying to
