OL,13,Fthousands were told to evacuate their

OL,8,FIntegration Support Centre is
OL,9,Fappealing for aid they can transport
OL,10,Fto Poland over the coming days.
OL,12,FAnna Buckley, the centre's Director
OL,13,Ftold us about a conversation she had
OL,14,Fwith a woman in Poland.
OL,16,F"The lady said to me: Anna I don't
OL,17,Fthink I will have anything, any place
OL,18,Fwhere I can come back, because I don't
OL,19,Fknow where our house is, everything is
OL,20,Fflooded, it's like a massive river."

OL,8,FWrexham said: "The flooding their
OL,9,Fmeans so much more because they don't
OL,10,Fhave the infrastructure we have here
OL,11,Fin the UK, they don't have the
OL,12,Fresponse system we have, and they
OL,13,Fdon't have the insurance systems in
OL,14,Fplace to help them recover when this
OL,15,Fis over so my heart really goes out to
OL,16,Fthem right now."
OL,18,FThe centre is well-prepared for the
OL,19,Ftask, having sent out around 80
OL,20,Florries and raised more than #4
