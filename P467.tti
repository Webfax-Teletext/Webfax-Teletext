OL,6,FFor over a year, French commandos
OL,7,Flived in a small town in north Wales
OL,8,Fand trained on the beaches and in the
OL,9,Fmountains of Snowdonia.
OL,11,FIt was 80 years ago that the town of
OL,12,FCriccieth found out they were
OL,13,Fexpecting around 100 new guests. They
OL,14,Fwere the Kieffer commandos, a group of
OL,15,Fexiles who took their name from their
OL,16,Fleader, Philippe Kieffer.

OL,6,FIt was in the North Wales town that
OL,7,Fthe members of the Kieffer commandos,
OL,8,Frifles in hand, took their first steps
OL,9,Fin getting back home towards the
OL,10,Finvasion of Normandy - and towards D-
OL,11,FDay.
OL,13,FHistorian Professor Merfyn Jones said
OL,14,Fthere's been a "kind of lapse of
OL,15,Fmemory" about the soldiers and it is
OL,16,Fonly now that people have recognised
OL,17,Fthem with a plaque in Criccieth.

OL,6,F"This was home to a very unique
OL,7,Fcompany of soldiers," he said. "They
OL,8,Fwere the marine commandos and they
OL,9,Flater had to honour of being the only
OL,10,FFrench troops that were involved in
OL,11,Fthe D-Day landing.
OL,13,F"So, they were a very particular breed
OL,14,Fof men. They are highly trained, very
OL,15,Ftough, very strong, and very
OL,16,Fdetermined to free France from the
OL,17,FNazis.

OL,6,F"It was the best place possible to
OL,7,Fpractice for a sea-borne invasion,
OL,8,Fwhich is what they had to do at 7.30
OL,9,Fon 6 June 1944. They had to jump into
OL,10,Fthe water in Normandy and attack some
OL,11,Fvery strong German oppositions."

OL,14,Fsee the end of this day 80 years ago.
OL,16,FNow, a group based in Criccieth have
OL,17,Fcreated a knitted version the
