OL,7,Fhanded a bundle of documents and told
OL,8,Fthat everything she needed to know
OL,9,Fabout her life was inside.
OL,11,FMaria had known from a young age that
OL,12,Fshe was adopted as a baby, but had
OL,13,Fthought little about her birth parents
OL,14,Funtil that day.
OL,16,FReading through the papers in her
OL,17,Fbedroom, she found her birth
OL,18,Fcertificate and her mother's name -
