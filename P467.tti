OL,6,FNo, The Vulcan has not had too much to

OL,8,Fpub is thanks to an incredible
OL,9,Fhistorical and architectural project
OL,10,Fwhich aimed to protect a piece of
OL,11,FWelsh boozing heritage.
OL,13,FThe Vulcan was originally built at 10

OL,6,FThere on that spot stood The Vulcan
OL,7,Fwhile the community then known as

OL,11,FDafydd Wiliam, principal curator of

OL,13,FNational Museum of History, explained:
OL,14,F"Back then the population of Newtown
OL,15,Fwas predominantly Irish because

OL,9,FForester's Arms was on the other side
OL,10,Fof the street.
OL,12,FEventually, Cardiff Council designated
OL,13,FNewtown as a slum and decided to
OL,14,Fdemolish the area during the 1960s and
OL,15,F1970s. The communities which lived

OL,8,FThousands of people signed a petition
