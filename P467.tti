OL,6,FAn inquest has found that death of the
OL,7,F"happy, loving and affectionate" child
OL,8,Fwas an accident.
OL,10,FSpeaking at Pontypridd Coroner's
OL,11,FCourt, assistant coroner Gavin Knox
OL,12,Fsaid the case had left him "concerned'
OL,13,Fabout the safety of vulnerable
OL,14,Fchildren and adults in hotels.
OL,16,FTheo's mother Nina Treharne told the
OL,17,Fcourt that her family had stayed at
OL,18,Fthe same hotel the previous year, but
OL,19,Fin different apartments, which had
OL,20,Fdoor chains inside the rooms to
OL,21,Fprevent children leaving.

OL,11,FTheo's parents, who were "alert to the
