OL,8,Fto try and improve outcomes for others
OL,9,Ffacing gynaecological cancers.
OL,11,FClaire O'Shea was diagnosed with

OL,13,Faggressive cancer, after initially
OL,14,Fbeing told she had irritable bowel
OL,15,Fsyndrome (IBS).
OL,17,FShe waited almost two years to get a
OL,18,Fcancer diagnosis. By then, it was too
OL,19,Fadvanced for doctors to save her life.

OL,6,FLast year, Claire's story formed part
OL,7,Fof a Senedd inquiry into how women
OL,8,Fwith gynaecological cancer are treated
OL,9,Fin Wales. Its report found a "bias"
OL,10,Fagainst women and said women's cancer
OL,11,Fconcerns were being "dismissed,
OL,12,Fdownplayed and unheard".
OL,14,FThe report made 26 recommendations,
OL,15,Fmost of which the Welsh Government
OL,16,Faccepted. But since the government
OL,17,Fmade gynaecological cancers a priority
OL,18,Fin March 2023, figures on the number
OL,19,Fof patients starting treatment on time
OL,20,Fhave got worse.

OL,15,FSpeaking to ITV Cymru Wales, she said:
