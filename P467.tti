OL,7,FWhen Dario Bucceri was diagnosed with
OL,8,F's in 2019, he was devastated.
OL,10,FHe believed the neurological disorder
OL,11,Fwould negatively impact every aspect
OL,12,Fof his life.
OL,14,FHowever, upon moving to in north
OL,15,FWales, Dario decided to embrace life
OL,16,Fwith Parkinson's and find different
OL,17,Fmethods to help him accept this new
OL,18,Freality.

OL,7,FSpeaking to ITV Wales, he said: "We
OL,8,Ffound the canal close to the house. So
OL,9,Fshortly after we moved here, I bought
OL,10,Fmyself a kayak and I come up here to
OL,11,Fexercise and to spend time with my
OL,12,Fson."
OL,14,F"I think it helps with my movement.
OL,15,FParkinson's takes big things and makes
OL,16,Fthem small. So it's good for me to
OL,17,Fpaddle and go through those motions,
OL,18,Fand just to be in a quiet environment
OL,19,Flike this."
OL,21,FDario's own journey has not been easy.

OL,7,FHe said his wife initially noticed his
OL,8,Fright arm was not swinging when he
OL,9,Fwalked. This, coupled with a
OL,10,Fdeteriorating sense of smell and
OL,11,Ftaste, as well as a loss of dexterity
OL,12,Fin his hands, led him to seek medical
OL,13,Fadvice.
OL,15,FHe said: "I got to the point where I
OL,16,Fwas down and depressed about it. But,
OL,17,Fone day, I decided that this had to be
OL,18,Fdifferent and that I'd make it the
OL,19,Fbest thing that's ever happened to me.
