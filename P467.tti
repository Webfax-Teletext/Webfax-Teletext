OL,7,Fthe all-consuming, head-over-heels,
OL,8,Fknock-your-socks-off kind. Why else
OL,9,Fwould we see it everywhere in popular
OL,10,Fculture, from romance novels to cinema
OL,11,Fscreens?
OL,13,FBut 'Cariad' seems almost laced into
OL,14,Fthe core of Welsh culture, the land of
OL,15,Fsong and poetry, land of the love
OL,16,Fballads and love spoons, cariad for

OL,7,Fmultifaceted. It is a story many of us
OL,8,Fwere told as children while we cut out
OL,9,Fred paper hearts and stuck them on
OL,10,Fcards for our loved ones. The 'adult'
OL,11,Fversion of the tale is a lot more
OL,12,Fsinister, but as a hopeless romantic,
OL,13,Fthis is the child-friendly adaption.
OL,15,FThe more well-known version of the
OL,16,Ftale is almost like a prelude to Romeo
OL,17,Fand Juliette: two star-crossed lovers,
OL,18,Fforbidden love, tragic ending. Add a
