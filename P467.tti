OL,12,Fto North Wales Police and RSPCA Cymru.
OL,13,FShe said: "I am appalled by the
OL,14,Factions of the man in the video. I
OL,15,Fwould like this person to be
OL,16,Fidentified and to be brought to book.

OL,15,Fwere left reeling at the distressing

OL,18,Fa Llandudno woman said: "Looks to me

OL,21,Fto get it to go to the water. If

OL,6,FFrom her experience, Jenni said seals
OL,7,Flike to haul up on beaches overnight
OL,8,Ffor a rest - she usually visits first
OL,9,Fthing in the morning when they're most
OL,10,Flikely to be present. She said local

OL,12,Funavailable when she called them
OL,13,Fimmediately after the incident.J"It's
OL,14,Fbeen a while since I've seen people
OL,15,Fthrowing things at the seals," she
OL,16,Fsaid. "Some even do it from the road
OL,17,Fwhen the seals are directly below.
OL,18,F"More often you see people going up to
OL,19,Fthem, shouting and screaming and
OL,20,Fclapping their hands to get a
OL,21,Fresponse. That's really quite common.
OL,22,F99% of the time, the seals quickly
OL,23,Fcrawl back out to sea. But this one
OL,24,Fwas younger and seemed uncertain what
OL,25,Fto do.J"My concern is that the seals
