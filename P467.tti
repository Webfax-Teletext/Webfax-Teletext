OL,6,FCardiff Council has announced plans to
OL,7,Fre-launch an e-bike hire scheme in the
OL,8,Fcity, after a previous programme was
OL,9,Faxed due to theft and vandalism.
OL,11,FThe scheme will be funded and operated
OL,12,Fby a private company, which has yet to
OL,13,Fbe announced.
OL,15,FThe Council said it will only cover
OL,16,Fthe cost of installing painted parking
OL,17,Fbays, while the private company would
OL,18,Fcover all day-to-day running costs.

OL,13,F3,000 bikes were stolen or vandalised
