OL,7,FDai's family and friends often
OL,8,Ftraveled to watch Wales play and had
OL,9,Ffriends who they stayed with when they

OL,12,FBut, in 1985, these friends were
OL,13,Funable to put them up and instead
OL,14,Fasked their neighbours - Shirley's

OL,12,FSpeaking to ITV Cymru Wales, she said:

OL,7,FAfter some months of phone calls,

OL,9,Fasked Shirley to marry him on a trip
OL,10,Fto the Isle of Skye. The couple
OL,11,Fselected a ring in Edinburgh on their

OL,14,FDai sold the house he owned in Cardiff
OL,15,Fand together they bought a house in
