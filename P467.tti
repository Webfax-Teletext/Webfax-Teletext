OL,6,FGoing into Friday's match there was a

OL,8,Fthe side out, with now-former captain

OL,11,Fto midfielder Angharad James.
OL,13,FThe role was in experienced hands

OL,17,FIt is not a permanent change though,
OL,18,Fwith manager Rhian Wilkinson telling
OL,19,Fthe press ahead of kick off "many
