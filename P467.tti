OL,6,FOn Wednesday, March 20, a spokesperson
OL,7,Ffor the Prisons and Probation
OL,8,FOmbudsman initially said they were
OL,9,Funable to make any assumptions as to
OL,10,Fwhether the deaths were at all linked.
OL,12,FHowever, a statement released today
OL,13,F(March 21) by Ombudsman Adrian Usher
OL,14,Fsaid "after initial enquiries, we now
OL,15,Fbelieve at least four out of the six
OL,16,Fdeaths are drug-related.
OL,18,FThe six deaths are among a total of 20
OL,19,Fdeaths at the prison the body has been
OL,20,Fnotified of, and begun investigating,
OL,21,Fsince January 2022.

OL,7,Fsaid: "Over the last few days, we
OL,8,Fconfirmed that six deaths have
OL,9,Foccurred at HMP Parc in just under one
OL,10,Fmonth. I am saddened by this high
OL,11,Fnumber, and I offer my deepest
OL,12,Fcondolences to those affected."
OL,14,FOmbudsman Adrian Usher added: "These

OL,16,Fpsychoactive substance), mixed with
OL,17,Fanother family of drugs."

OL,11,FThe initial enquiries have led prison
