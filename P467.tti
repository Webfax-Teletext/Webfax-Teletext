OL,6,FBlaenau Gwent, Gwynedd and Torfaen are
OL,7,Fthe areas of Wales most at risk from
OL,8,Fwildfires but overall risk fell year-
OL,9,Fon-year, according to new research.
OL,11,FIt comes as ITV Wales has been with
OL,12,Ffirefighters near Brecon who are
OL,13,Flooking to locate water sources and
OL,14,Fhydrants to help tackle fires in hard

OL,17,FThe Matthews family farm near Brecon,
OL,18,Fripped through fire in the summer of
OL,19,F2022 and it was difficult to put out.

OL,6,FFarmer Andy Matthews said: "It was
OL,7,Fpretty catastrophic. It sort of raced
OL,8,Fthrough four or five fields of ripe
OL,9,Fcrop. We had seven or eight fire
OL,10,Fengines in attendance, which was a
OL,11,Fnightmare for everyone really.
OL,13,F"It was really unlucky with the
OL,14,Fweather and the circumstances. It
OL,15,Fspread like wildfire. Once they'd used

OL,17,Freally struggled to fill them back up
