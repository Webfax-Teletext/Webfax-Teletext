OL,6,FWales' interim head coach Matt
OL,7,FSherratt was heartened by his side's

OL,11,F"Obviously a real brave effort at the

OL,13,Fbut I've seen enough of those games
OL,14,Fwhere the reality is they probably

OL,16,Fdropped off five per cent," said
OL,17,FSherratt.
OL,19,F"What I did feel, though, is there was
OL,20,Fa hell of a lot of effort from our
OL,21,Fboys in that last 20 minutes.
