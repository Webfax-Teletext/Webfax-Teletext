OL,6,FPressure has grown on Page since Wales
OL,7,Ffinished bottom of their group at the
OL,8,F2022 World Cup in Qatar and failed to
OL,9,Fqualify for this summer's European
OL,10,FChampionship.
OL,12,FPage has over two years left on the
OL,13,Fcontract he signed in September 2022,
OL,14,Fbut he was booed by supporters again
OL,15,Fafter going over to them after the
OL,16,Ffinal whistle while others called for
OL,17,Fhim to quit on social media.

OL,6,F"I get it, I'm a supporter myself,"
OL,7,FPage told S4C following the defeat. "I
OL,8,Fwent over to the supporters and
OL,9,Fclapped them with the lads. When the
OL,10,Flads went, I made a point of saying to
OL,11,Fthem 'it's on me and I'll take it'.
OL,13,F"I apologised to the supporters at the

OL,15,Fand I completely understand their
OL,16,Ffrustration.
OL,18,F"If the powers that be decide I'm not
OL,19,Fthe one to lead them forward then
OL,20,Fthat's their decision."

OL,6,FThe creativity of Aaron Ramsey, David

OL,8,Fmissing, and Page ripped up his
OL,9,Ffavoured formation to play four at the
OL,10,Fback with Ampadu moved there from his
OL,11,Fusual midfield station.
OL,13,F"We didn't have any of the back five
OL,14,Fand we've tried to give games, minutes
OL,15,Fand caps to some of the younger
OL,16,Fplayers," said Page.
OL,18,F"It was an opportunity for us to look
