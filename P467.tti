OL,7,FThe last 12 months have been a journey
OL,8,Fin many different ways.
OL,10,FAt just 20 years of age, she stunned
OL,11,Fthe world in August 2023 when she
OL,12,Fbecame the fastest woman on two wheels.
OL,14,FBut it hasn't all been plain sailing.
OL,15,FShe openly admits that before that
OL,16,Ffinal in Glasgow, she found herself
OL,17,Fsitting in a toilet stall crying as
OL,18,Fthe pressure became too much.
OL,20,FBut she composed herself, went out
OL,21,Fonto the track, and achieved greatness.
