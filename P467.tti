OL,6,FThe grandfather began his career as a
OL,7,Fconductor at the age of 18, before
OL,8,Fbecoming a driver three years later.
OL,10,FHe has worked for five different
OL,11,Fcompanies in his tenure and has always
OL,12,Fbeen based in Swansea.
OL,14,FMr Becker said: "It was great being a
OL,15,Fdriver in 1969. We had so many routes
OL,16,Fand carried so many passengers,
OL,17,Fincluding lots from all the factories,
OL,18,Fthe collieries and British Steel at
OL,19,FPort Talbot, but, of course, all that
OL,20,Fdeclined in the 1980s.

OL,6,F"I also remember we had double-deckers
OL,7,Fback then, but passengers were only
OL,8,Fallowed to smoke on the top deck.
OL,10,F"Upstairs was like a mist. All the
OL,11,Ffactory girls and everybody else was
OL,12,Fup there smoking, it was unbelievable."
OL,14,FMr Beckers said the "loss of
OL,15,Fcommuters" has been the biggest change
OL,16,Fduring his career.
OL,18,FHe said: "The reduction in office
OL,19,Fworkers and shop workers, and more
OL,20,Fpeople buying cars, means we've seen a
OL,21,Fdecline in bus travel.
