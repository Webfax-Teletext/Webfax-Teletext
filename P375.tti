OL,7,Fappeal against a #750,000 fine imposed
OL,8,Ffor a social media post criticising a
OL,9,FPremier League referee.
OL,11,FForest criticised referee Stuart
OL,12,FAttwell in a post on social media
OL,13,Fafter a two nil loss to Everton in the
OL,14,FPremier League last April.
OL,16,FThe club felt three penalty decisions
OL,17,Fhad gone against them and implied
OL,18,FAtwell, who was working as the video
OL,19,Fassistant referee (VAR), was not
OL,20,Fimpartial because he was a fan of
OL,21,Frelegation rival Luton Town.
