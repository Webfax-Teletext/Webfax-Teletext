OL,6,FDes explains: "It's a real phenomenon
OL,7,Fcreated by the same mechanism that
OL,8,Fallows the development of
OL,9,Fthunderstorms in the summer, which is
OL,10,Finstability in the atmosphere and lots
OL,11,Fof energy.
OL,13,F"But this time because the air is cold
OL,14,Fit forces the rain to turn to snow.

OL,6,F"This physically and fundamentally
OL,7,Fimpacts on what we hear and how we
OL,8,Fperceive it, which gives us that
OL,9,Fforeboding end of the world image that
OL,10,Fmany speak about. That's because the
OL,11,Fsnow muffles and dampens the sound of
OL,12,Fthe thunder sounding more like an
OL,13,Fechoing dull boom and the lightning
OL,14,Freflects off the snow giving off that
OL,15,Fbright eerie yet somehow muted glow.
OL,17,F"So thundersnow from thunderstorms may
OL,18,Fnot be as frightening as one thinks
OL,19,Fbut it sure has an awesome name!"
