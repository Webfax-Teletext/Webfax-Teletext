OL,6,FPeople living in a village close to a
OL,7,Fnature reserve have criticised plans
OL,8,Fby Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife
OL,9,FTrust to cull deer.
OL,11,FThe charity plans to shoot some
OL,12,Fmuntjac deer to protect 13,000 newly-
OL,13,Fplanted saplings on the site at
OL,14,FHolwell near Melton Mowbray.
OL,16,FThe Wildlife Trust also argues that
OL,17,Fthe muntjac deer don't have any
OL,18,Fnatural predators and need their
OL,19,Fpopulation to be controlled.

OL,6,FThe co-ordinator of the local campaign

OL,8,FBlake, says they don't have a problem
OL,9,Fwith the muntjac deer.
OL,11,FHe says that locals found it
OL,12,F"incomprehensible" that "a wildlife
OL,13,Ftrust would shoot animals on our local
OL,14,Fnature reserve".
OL,16,FHe said the plans were "cruel,
OL,17,Funnecessary and dangerous. Shooting an
OL,18,Fanimal must be the last resort".

OL,10,FMr Wilkinson-Blake said they were

OL,16,FThe muntjac has no natural predators
