OL,6,FHansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire,
OL,7,Fwhere the ring is expected to go up

OL,9,Fhints at a bond between conspirators,
OL,10,Fsaying, "At the time, the gold bands,
OL,11,Fknown as posy rings, were given as
OL,12,Fgifts among male friends to symbolise
OL,13,Faffection, allegiance or support

OL,16,FThey say it may be part of a pack with
OL,17,Fthe "deed" being blowing up Parliament.
OL,19,FAccording to the British Museum, the
OL,20,Finscription is unusual for rings of
OL,21,Fthe period.
