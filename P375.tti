OL,6,FSergeant Matthew Crabtree,
OL,7,FNottinghamshire Police, said: "This
OL,8,Fwas a horrendous display of driving

OL,11,Fpassengers or the occupants of the

OL,14,F"Thanks to the determination and skill
OL,15,Fof the officers involved, he was
OL,16,Fprevented from doing any more harm on
OL,17,Fthe road network that night ` but he
OL,18,Fwas still able to disgrace himself
OL,19,Ffurther by launching a disgusting
