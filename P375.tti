OL,6,FUntil 1968, when steam trains were

OL,8,Ffor British Rail trains.
OL,10,F'We weren't supposed to take photos'
OL,12,FMr Wood said: "I was a huge steam

OL,14,Fon the engine. Being a fireman takes a

OL,17,F"You need to know when you are going

OL,20,Froad'. I was happy to get involved."
