OL,7,FWhen Lestari was four weeks old,
OL,8,Fkeepers noticed that there was a
OL,9,Fweakness in her front limbs, which was
OL,10,Faffecting her development.
OL,12,FThe keepers and veterinary team set up
OL,13,Fa physiotherapy programme over three
OL,14,Fweeks, involving exercises and using
OL,15,Fwalking aids to help strengthen her
OL,16,Flegs.
OL,18,FA year later and the programme worked,
OL,19,Fas Lestari responded well to the
OL,20,Ftreatment and could run, leap and
OL,21,Fbound normally.

OL,8,Fhas gone from strength to strength

OL,14,F"Lestari is very active and
OL,15,Fmischievous - she will always explore
OL,16,Fany enrichment we provide. Although
OL,17,Fshe seems very independent at times,
