OL,4,C444 million year-old fossil
OL,6,FThe palaeontologist has been studying
OL,7,Fthe specimen for the last 25 years,
OL,8,Fand her research reveals that Sue, the
OL,9,Ffossil, was an arthropod, which is
OL,10,Ffrom the same family of creatures as
OL,11,Fshrimps, lobsters, spiders, mites,
OL,12,Fmillipedes and centipedes.
OL,14,FToday, about 85% of animals on Earth
OL,15,Fare arthropods. They have an excellent
OL,16,Ffossil record stretching back over 500
OL,17,Fmillion years, but usually their
OL,18,Ffossil remains are of their external
OL,19,Ffeatures, whereas 'Sue' is the
OL,20,Fcomplete opposite because it is her
OL,21,Finsides that are fossilized.

OL,6,FProfessor Gabbott said: "I named this

OL,8,Fsaid to me that I must follow my
OL,9,Fdreams, and do a career that I was
OL,10,Freally interested in.
OL,12,F"For me, that was digging rocks,
OL,13,Ffinding fossils, and trying to work
OL,14,Fout how they lived and how they
OL,15,Fevolved, and so I thought it was a
OL,16,Fnice thing to do, name a species after
OL,17,Fmy mum.
OL,19,F"This fossil is 444 million years old.
OL,20,FIt's incredibly well preserved.
