OL,6,FA nine-year-old boy from Maghaberry in
OL,7,FCo Antrim has written and published a
OL,8,Fbook about a superhero with autism.
OL,10,FNoah Adams, who is autistic, was
OL,11,Finspired to write his first novel
OL,12,Fafter seeing a lack of diversity in
OL,13,Fsuperhero comics.
OL,15,F"Mr Fantastic is the only superhero I
OL,16,Fknow with autism, so I wanted to make
OL,17,Fa new one with autism, a newer kind of
OL,18,Fgeneration because Mr Fantastic is
OL,19,Fkind of fading away, so from now on my
OL,20,Fbook is going to be the main superhero
OL,21,Fof autism," said Noah.

OL,6,FNoah's grandfather, David, helped

OL,8,Fonline.
OL,10,FWhile he may have helped get the words
OL,11,Fdown on paper, all the ideas,
OL,12,Fincluding the plot and characters,
OL,13,Fwere from Noah's imagination.
OL,15,F"He asked me, he said 'Dada can I
OL,16,Fwrite a book?' I said yes and he asked
OL,17,Fcould you help me, so that's how it
OL,18,Fbegan," David told UTV.
