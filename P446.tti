OL,7,Fwithin the DUP have publicly
OL,8,Fcriticised the arrangements.JFormer

OL,11,Fengaging in "an all-out PR operation"
OL,12,Fand of being "economical with the
OL,13,Freality" in the Lords on Tuesday.J"The
OL,14,Freality is that the deal ... still
OL,15,Fretains the protocol Windsor Framework
OL,16,Fwith all its inherent anti-Unionist
OL,17,Fcontents," he said.JAddressing party
OL,18,Fmembers and supporters in Newry and
OL,19,FArmagh, Sir Jeffrey argued that
OL,20,Fdecisions made today "will either grow
OL,21,Fsupport for Northern Ireland or will
OL,22,Fcede ground to the enemies of the
OL,23,FUnion".JHe said that the coming
