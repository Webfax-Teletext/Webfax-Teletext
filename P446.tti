OL,6,FTo find out your eldest son has died
OL,7,Fis a parent's worst nightmare. To hear
OL,8,Fthat he had been a nameless body in a
OL,9,Fmorgue for over a year was simply too
OL,10,Fmuch.
OL,12,FIn December 2024, the family of James
OL,13,FO'Neill, known as Jim, were told he
OL,14,Fwas dead, after his body was
OL,15,Fdiscovered in Dublin's Phoenix Park.
OL,17,FWhat they didn't know, was that James
OL,18,Fhad been dead for a year and was lying
OL,19,Fin a morgue unidentified.

OL,9,FHis father Paul O'Neill told UTV: "We
OL,10,Fwere not allowed to look at Jim, we
OL,11,Fcouldn't touch him, we couldn't look
OL,12,Fat him, we couldn't say good bye. He
OL,13,Fcame in a closed coffin."
OL,15,FJames lived a nomadic lifestyle. He
OL,16,Foften camped outside, hiked in the
OL,17,Fmountains and did not own a phone.
OL,19,FHis family were accustomed to him
