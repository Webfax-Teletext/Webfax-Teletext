OL,6,FThe office of Commonwealth Games

OL,12,FCWGNI chief executive Conal Heatley
OL,13,Fsaid the office in Belfast would be
OL,14,Fclosed for a few days while a security
OL,15,Fassessment is conducted.
OL,17,FHe said the move came after
OL,18,Fthreatening messages were directed at

OL,12,FMr Heatley said the proposal reflected
