OL,4,Cspeculation over bluetongue
OL,6,FAsked where bluetongue may have
OL,7,Foriginated from, Mr Muir said that may
OL,8,Fbe difficult to pinpoint as the
OL,9,Fdisease is spread by midges but
OL,10,Fstressed that they can rule out the
OL,11,Fdisease being brought in via an
OL,12,Fimported animal.
OL,14,FHe said: "There has been some stuff on
OL,15,Fsocial media, conspiracy theories and
OL,16,Fall the rest. Those people need to
OL,17,Fcatch themselves on. They are doing a
OL,18,Freal injustice to farming in Northern
OL,19,FIreland.
