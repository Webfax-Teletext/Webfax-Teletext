OL,3,CDUP Leader criticised for telling

OL,6,FExplaining why he has gone public with
OL,7,Fhis decision, he said: "On account of
OL,8,Fwhat Gavin Robinson said yesterday, it
OL,9,Fwas a bit rich for the leader of the
OL,10,FDUP to provide advice in one hand and
OL,11,Fthen insult us on the other hand."
OL,13,FIt is a move supported by Sinn Fein,
OL,14,Fwho are calling on Mr Robinson to
OL,15,Fwithdraw his latest comments.
OL,17,FMP John Finucane, said: "It's
OL,18,Finsulting, it's shameful, and it says
OL,19,Fmore about Gavin Robinson than it ever
OL,20,Fwill about those families."
