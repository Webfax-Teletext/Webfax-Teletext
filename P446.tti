OL,6,FStormont's new Health Minister has
OL,7,Fmade clear he is not prepared to
OL,8,Fimplement "catastrophic cuts" to
OL,9,Fservices.JMike Nesbitt said replacing
OL,10,FRobin Swann in the job was the
OL,11,Fpolitical honour of his life but also
OL,12,Fthe "ultimate political challenge of
OL,13,Fmy life".JThe Strangford MLA said
OL,14,Fwhile he did not underestimate
OL,15,Fchallenges facing the health service
OL,16,Fhe wanted to inject a sense of hope
OL,17,Fthat it was not in a "fatalistic
OL,18,Fspiral to the bottom".
