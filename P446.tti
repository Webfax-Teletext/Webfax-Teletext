OL,6,FMeeting one lottery winner is a rare
OL,7,Foccurrence but interviewing two at the
OL,8,Fsame time is incredible.
OL,10,FOn this week's Going the Extra Mile I
OL,11,Fwas joined by Peter Lavery who won
OL,12,Fover #10 million thirty years ago this
OL,13,Fyear and Jonny Johnston who won almost
OL,14,F#4 million in the National Lottery in
OL,15,F2023.
OL,17,FWhile Peter has given and raised
OL,18,Fmillions for charity over the last few
OL,19,Fdecades, Jonny is at the start of his
OL,20,Fphilanthropic journey.

OL,9,FBefore their respective wins, Peter
OL,10,Fwas a bus driver and Jonny was (and
OL,11,Fstill is a delivery driver for a major
OL,12,Fsupermarket).
OL,14,FJonny recalls the moment he realised
OL,15,Fthat he had won. 'First of all you
OL,16,Fthink it's a scam. We phoned up the
OL,17,Fnumber and that's when it all hit.
OL,18,FReality struck. You just get so many
OL,19,Fdifferent feelings and emotions.'

OL,14,F'Giving something back is nice and I

OL,6,FJonny has also started giving back
OL,7,Fwhen he helped carry out maintenance
