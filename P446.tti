OL,7,FLegislation aimed at cutting the cost
OL,8,Fof school uniforms has passed its
OL,9,Ffinal stage in the Stormont Assembly.
OL,11,FThe School Uniforms Bill has been
OL,12,Fsupported by all parties, meaning
OL,13,Fschools will receive a set of
OL,14,Fguidelines to set their uniform policy.
OL,16,FThese have not been published yet and
OL,17,Fthe bill does not place a specific cap

OL,11,FPaul Givan said: "There should be no

OL,14,FThe Education Minister said schools
