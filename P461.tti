OL,6,FYou can tell a lot from where

OL,9,Fcampaigning in an election.
OL,11,FPolitical party members hate the

OL,13,Fbecause as far as they're concerned
OL,14,Fthey'll be campaigning until 10pm on
OL,15,FThursday.
OL,17,FBut that campaigning goes on in very
OL,18,Flocal ways, and out of sight of TV
OL,19,Fcameras because the law governing
OL,20,Fbroadcasters insists that there's no
OL,21,Fpolitical reporting on polling day.
