OL,6,FIn a post on Facebook, Vale Pick Your
OL,7,FOwn said that although eating
OL,8,Fstrawberries before paying for them
OL,9,Fmay seem harmless to some, it is
OL,10,F"equivalent to taking products without
OL,11,Fpaying in a shop or eating without
OL,12,Fpaying in a cafe."
OL,14,F'Pick-your-own' farms have been become
OL,15,Fmore and more popular in recent years.
OL,17,FThe business model invites visitors to
OL,18,Fa farm or field where they can pick
OL,19,Ftheir own flowers, fruit or
OL,20,Fvegetables, and pay afterwards for
OL,21,Fwhat they have picked.
