OL,3,CFormer First Minister: Labour 'may not

OL,6,FFormer First Minister Carwyn Jones has
OL,7,Fconceded that Labour may not be the
OL,8,Flargest party after the Senedd
OL,9,Felection and could even find itself as
OL,10,Fa junior party in any post-May deal.
OL,12,FSpeaking to Wales This Week, Lord
OL,13,FJones said that while he is "not
OL,14,Fconceding," he does see a scenario in
OL,15,Fwhich Labour must consider who it can
OL,16,Fwork with.
OL,18,F"It's new ground for us; it would be
OL,19,Fquite a hurdle psychologically," he
OL,20,Fsaid.
