OL,8,Fsecretary was asked which are the most
OL,9,Fdifficult areas are when it comes to
OL,10,Frecruitment and retention.
OL,12,FHe said: "The most challenging areas
OL,13,Ffor us are in mental health, learning
OL,14,Fdisability, some therapy professions,
OL,15,Fmidwifery. So there are challenges in
OL,16,Fthose areas.

OL,10,Fwould say that in general, the reason
