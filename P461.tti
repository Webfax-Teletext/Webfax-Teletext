OL,6,FCardiff Council conducted a
OL,7,Fconsultation in which 66% of
OL,8,Frespondents agreed that larger
OL,9,Fvehicles should pay more for permits,
OL,10,Fwhile less than a quarter disagreed
OL,11,F(24%).
OL,13,FResidents say the lack of parking
OL,14,Favailability in Cardiff is exacerbated
OL,15,Fby the space taken by larger vehicles
OL,16,Fwhich are deemed to be 'carspreading.'
OL,18,FHundreds signed a petition calling for
OL,19,F"fairer parking charges based on the
OL,20,Fsize of the car to reduce congestion
OL,21,Fand road danger."
