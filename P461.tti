OL,13,Fgo into labour.
OL,15,FBut, instead of the original six or
OL,16,Feight puppies that were expected, the
OL,17,FLabrador gave birth to a huge litter
OL,18,Fof 14.

OL,6,FTilly's owner Meirion Thomas was on
OL,7,Fholiday with his own family, when the
OL,8,Fpups started arriving a week earlier
OL,9,Fthan expected.
OL,11,FThe labour was 15 hours long, with the
OL,12,Ffirst puppy arriving at 6.10pm and the
OL,13,Flast the next morning at 9am.
OL,15,FReflecting on the long night, Rhian
OL,16,Fsaid: "We thought a few times that
OL,17,Fthat was it, especially considering it
OL,18,Fwas meant to be five or six, but it
OL,19,Fwasn't. Quite overwhelming really, at
OL,20,Fone point we lost count!"

OL,6,FTilly and her pups were also helped by
OL,7,FRhian's husband, Steve, and their two
OL,8,Fchildren, Nia and William.
OL,10,FThe puppies already have different-

OL,12,Fapart, with the smallest puppy named
OL,13,F"Titch".
OL,15,FMeirion described Tilly as an amazing
OL,16,Fmum, saying: "She's a better mum than
OL,17,Fanyone could wish for."
OL,19,FOnce the puppies are old enough, both
OL,20,FMeirion and Rhian plan to adopt one
OL,21,Feach.
