OL,5,FThis is expected to bring an end to
OL,6,Ffinger pointing and blaming each other
OL,7,Ffor the way things are run, and will
OL,8,Fraise expectations if a Labour
OL,9,Fgovernment in No 10 will lead to
OL,10,Ftangible improvements for Wales on
OL,11,Fboth devolved and non-devolved matters.

OL,14,FStevens was a lawyer at Thompsons
OL,15,FSolicitors ` a firm with longstanding
OL,16,Flinks to the trade union movement.
OL,18,FMs Stevens has opposed the devolution
OL,19,Fof justice powers which has sometimes
OL,20,Fput her at odds with the Welsh Labour
OL,21,Fadministration in the past.
