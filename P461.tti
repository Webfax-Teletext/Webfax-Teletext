OL,7,FThe 39-year-old said when they saw a
OL,8,Fbone "sticking out of the ground," his
OL,9,Fson thought he had "found a dinosaur,"
OL,10,Fwhile Christopher thought it was a

OL,13,FIt was only when they returned home
OL,14,Fthat it dawned on Christopher they
OL,15,Fmight have made a more grizzly
OL,16,Fdiscovery.
OL,18,FHe explained: "When we got home, the

OL,21,Fthen."
