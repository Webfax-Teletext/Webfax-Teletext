OL,11,FIt follows concerns over rising water

OL,15,FDeputy First Minister Huw Irranca-

OL,6,FThe report, commissioned earlier this
OL,7,Fyear, has prompted what ministers are
OL,8,Fcalling a "once-in-a-generation
OL,9,Fopportunity" to reset the sector.
OL,11,FThe Deputy First Minister told members
OL,12,Fthat the government intends to move
OL,13,Ftowards a water system that is "more
OL,14,Fsustainable, fair and transparent,"
OL,15,Fbut also admitted that the current
OL,16,Fsystem is failing to meet public and
OL,17,Fenvironmental expectations.
OL,19,F"People are rightly worried about
OL,20,Ftheir water bills and the state of our
OL,21,Fwaterways," he said.

OL,13,FAccording to the plans, this would
