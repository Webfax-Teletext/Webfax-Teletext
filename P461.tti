OL,6,FIn a new series on S4C, Wales on
OL,7,FDrugs, Ollie said that taking the drug
OL,8,Fwas as normal as brushing his teeth
OL,9,Fwhen he was addicted to ketamine for a
OL,10,Fperiod of eight years.
OL,12,FHe said that he was only using small
OL,13,Famounts at the weekend to begin with
OL,14,Fbut this grew enormously over time and
OL,15,Fturned into a huge problem.
OL,17,FHe said: "When I was like three years
OL,18,Finto the addiction, I was using ket
OL,19,Fevery day. I was using 21 grams, and
OL,20,Fit just turned into the most normal
OL,21,Fthing."

OL,6,FBecause of the drug, Ollie began to
OL,7,Fsuffer with what he calls "ket cramps".
OL,9,FIt "felt like someone was grabbing my
OL,10,Fkidneys," he said, and "in the end,
OL,11,Fthe only thing that helped the pain...
OL,12,Fwas the ket itself".
OL,14,FHe described that period of time as a
OL,15,F"vicious cycle" of suffering the side
OL,16,Feffects of the drug and taking more of
OL,17,Fit to deal with the severe pain. As
OL,18,Fthe ketamine destroyed his bladder he
OL,19,Fbegan to pass blood and pieces of the
OL,20,Flining of the organ as well.

OL,6,FThe ketamine also affected the size of

OL,8,Famount he could hold and causing him
OL,9,Fto need to pass water "every sixty

OL,12,FSpeaking before having the surgery to
