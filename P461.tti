OL,6,FSince September 2023, local
OL,7,Fauthorities here in Wales have been
OL,8,Fobliged to set speed limits in urban
OL,9,Fand residential areas at 20mph as a
OL,10,Fdefault, even though they can keep
OL,11,Fsome of those roads at 30mph.
OL,13,FMr Skates will set out the changes in

OL,6,FThe number of roads likely to change
OL,7,Fback to 30mph could vary considerably
OL,8,Facross Wales. Last week, the leaders
OL,9,Fof Cardiff and Swansea councils said
OL,10,Fthat they expected around half a dozen
OL,11,Froads to be affected. Officials
OL,12,Festimate that in other authorities the

OL,15,FMr Skates has already said that the
OL,16,FWelsh Government will cover the costs
OL,17,Fof any new changes. The original cost
OL,18,Fof implementing the policy was #30m.
OL,19,FThese new changes are expected to cost
