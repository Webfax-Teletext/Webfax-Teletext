OL,6,FFather Thaddeus Kotik, who died in
OL,7,F1992, sexually abused girls and boys
OL,8,Fwhile he was a monk at the abbey. The
OL,9,Freview concluded that he used a
OL,10,Ftortoise and "other attractive treats"
OL,11,Fto entice children into the monastery
OL,12,Fgarden, where he would sexually abuse
OL,13,Fthem.
OL,15,FThe report also said he "groomed"
OL,16,Fparents by "overwhelming" them with
OL,17,Fattention, offering babysitting help
OL,18,Fand giving small gifts.
