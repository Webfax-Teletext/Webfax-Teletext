OL,6,FAs a teenager, Jamie Pye was bullied at
OL,7,Fschool and he developed an eating
OL,8,Fdisorder (ED). When he sought help, he
OL,9,Ffelt being male made it more difficult
OL,10,Fto access treatment.
OL,12,FHis doctors were helpful, recognising
OL,13,Fthat something was wrong, but he
OL,14,Fencountered issues before being
OL,15,Fdiagnosed with anorexia. "It was
OL,16,Fdifficult, because the criteria for
OL,17,Freferral was aimed at women, such as
OL,18,Fthe loss of periods, which obviously
OL,19,Fdidn't apply to me," he said.
