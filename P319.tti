OL,10,FThe collapse in US government long
OL,11,Fbonds, Treasuries, is startling, scary.
OL,13,FIt is precisely the opposite of what
OL,14,FTrump and his advisers expected and
OL,15,Fwanted.
OL,17,FIt partly reflects heightened fears of
OL,18,FUS recession - which would see
OL,19,Fballooning of US deficit - and may
OL,20,Falso be revenge selling by sovereign
