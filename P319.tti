OL,6,FUS President Donald Trump on Monday

OL,8,Flinking autism to the use of
OL,9,Fparacetamol as well as vaccinations.
OL,11,FScientists hit back at the president's

OL,13,F"strong evidence base" that the
OL,14,Fpainkiller paracetamol is safe to use
OL,15,Fwhile pregnant.
OL,17,FThe UK's Health Secretary, Wes
OL,18,FStreeting, urged people to "listen to
OL,19,FBritish doctors, British scientists,
OL,20,Fthe NHS, not Donald Trump.
