OL,8,Fthe subsequent revelations about his
OL,9,Fhideous relationship with the
OL,10,Fconvicted paedophile Epstein, have

OL,13,Fmarred British politics for a decade.
OL,15,FHe acknowledged this when I pressed

OL,17,Fit is why this was arguably the most
OL,18,Fill-advised political appointment of

OL,6,FOne outstanding glaring question is
OL,7,Fwhy on earth he believed Mandelson,
OL,8,Fgiven both the former minister's
OL,9,Finglorious track record of
OL,10,Ftransgressions that saw him twice
OL,11,Fsacked from previous governments and
OL,12,Fthat much of the Labour Party has long
OL,13,Fviewed him as toxic.
OL,15,FAnother is why the evidence Mandelson
OL,16,Fhad contact with Epstein - especially
OL,17,Fafter Epstein was imprisoned for
OL,18,Fsoliciting a child for prostitution -
OL,19,Fwasn't sufficient reason in and of

OL,21,Fwhatever Mandelson said.
