OL,4,Cdays of PM Starmer?
OL,6,FKeir Starmer seems to believe running
OL,7,Fthe country is like running a giant
OL,8,Fsupermarket chain.
OL,10,FBecause in his own evaluation of his
OL,11,Ffirst year in office, he reels off a
OL,12,Flist of his government's achievements,
OL,13,Fas if it were a list of products he
OL,14,Fhas sold to us.
OL,16,FThese include, he says, millions of
OL,17,Fadditional medical treatments, more
OL,18,Ffree school meals, a tariff deal with
OL,19,FAmerica, enhanced employee rights, and
OL,20,Fa #6 billion increase in defence
OL,21,Fspending.

OL,8,FOh, and then there was the small

OL,10,Fmended the public finances and began
OL,11,Fto fix public services by raising
OL,12,Ftaxes to the tune of #40 billion.
OL,14,FSo his government has not been a big

OL,18,Fwe, the British people, are remarkably

OL,6,FAnd even his own MPs have become
OL,7,Ftreacherous allies, as we saw when
OL,8,Fthey forced him to make humiliating
OL,9,Fand expensive u-turns on his plans to

OL,12,FSo what's gone wrong?
OL,14,FWell, it's largely that so much of

OL,16,Fuseful stuff that we voters think

OL,6,FHere is what you might call Starmer's
OL,7,Fargument with the electorate. He
OL,8,Fthinks being halfway competent is
OL,9,Fenough.
OL,11,FHe says, for example, that his sole
OL,12,Fambition is to "improve the lives of
OL,13,Fworking people".
OL,15,FHe doesn't "believe" in anything else.
OL,16,FHe is not ideological. He recoils at
OL,17,Fthe suggestion he should sell us a
OL,18,F"vision".
OL,20,FHe will never be "performative".
