OL,6,FThis Summer as temperatures soared so
OL,7,Fdid tempers, as a record number of
OL,8,Foften violent protests erupted across
OL,9,Fthe UK. The issue of hotels once used
OL,10,Ffor tourists now housing thousands of
OL,11,Fasylum seekers was supercharged by a
OL,12,Fhigh profile case in which a 14 year
OL,13,Fold girl was sexually assaulted by an
OL,14,Fasylum seeker in Epping - resulting in
OL,15,Fa 12 month prison sentence.
