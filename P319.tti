OL,6,FSir Keir Starmer has said he has "no
OL,7,Fdoubt" that a major trilateral defence
OL,8,Fdeal between the UK, Australia and the
OL,9,FUS will prove a success, despite the
OL,10,FDonald Trump administration carrying
OL,11,Fout a review of the pact.
OL,13,FAnnounced in 2021, Aukus involves the
OL,14,Fthree nations building a new
OL,15,Fgeneration of nuclear-powered attack
OL,16,Fsubmarines and cooperating in other

OL,6,FThe deal will also see Australia buy

OL,11,FThat provision has led some in
