OL,12,FBut on the eve of Thursday's Senedd by-
OL,13,Felection, that sense of permanence is
OL,14,Fcrumbling.
OL,16,FLabour is defending a seat where it
OL,17,Fgoverns at all three levels of
OL,18,Fgovernment, and polls suggest votes
OL,19,Fare peeling away in two very different
OL,20,Fdirections: Plaid Cymru and Reform UK.
