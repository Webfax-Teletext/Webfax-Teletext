OL,6,FITV News' Rachel Younger reflects on
OL,7,Fthe choices Saida's parents were
OL,8,Fforced to make after the October 7
OL,9,Fattacks triggered war
OL,11,FWhen I first met the irrepressible
OL,12,FSaida at a hospital in East Jerusalem,
OL,13,Fthe war wasn't yet a year old - and
OL,14,Fnor was she.
OL,16,FAn IVF baby, Saida's mother had
OL,17,Ftravelled from Gaza to the West Bank
OL,18,Fto deliver her, because even before
OL,19,Fthe conflict, facilities for the most
OL,20,Fpremature babies were limited.

OL,7,Fin the late summer of 2023, barely
OL,8,Fmore than a bag of sugar.
OL,10,FBut her mother, Hiba Abu Aun, had to
OL,11,Freturn to Gaza to renew her papers
OL,12,Fbefore she could even hold her newborn.
OL,14,FAgonisingly, she was meant to come
OL,15,Fback to collect Saida on October 8.
OL,16,FBut on October 7, Israel was attacked
OL,17,Fby Hamas, trapping Hiba inside Gaza.
