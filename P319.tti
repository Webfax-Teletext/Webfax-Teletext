OL,7,FThe visit by the Princess of Wales on
OL,8,FTuesday to the hospital where she had
OL,9,Fher cancer treatment was all about
OL,10,FKate reflecting on her own personal
OL,11,Fjourney last year.
OL,13,FAnd today has been a moment for her to
OL,14,Fbond with other patients undergoing
OL,15,Ftheir own treatments for cancer.
OL,17,FIt's nearly a year to the day since
OL,18,FKensington Palace announced the
OL,19,Fprincess was undergoing a major
OL,20,Foperation which they would only
OL,21,Fdescribe as "abdominal surgery".
