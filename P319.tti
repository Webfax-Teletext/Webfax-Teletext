OL,6,FStorm Eowyn, our fifth storm of the
OL,7,Fseason, was named by the Met Office
OL,8,Fthis morning and is forecast to bring
OL,9,Fgusts between 90 and 100mph across
OL,10,Fparts of the UK throughout Friday.
OL,12,FSo when will the storm arrive and how
OL,13,Fbad is it expected to be?
OL,15,FWinds will start to freshen across
OL,16,Fwestern parts overnight Thursday into
OL,17,FFriday, quickly spreading to all areas
OL,18,Fand accompanied by a band of heavy
OL,19,Frain that sweeps eastwards across the
OL,20,FUK.
