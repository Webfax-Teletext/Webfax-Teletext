OL,7,FThe so-called Wagatha Christie row
OL,8,Fbegan in 2019 when Rooney, wife of

OL,10,FRooney, publicly accused the Instagram
OL,11,Faccount held by Vardy of leaking
OL,12,Fstories about her to The Sun newspaper.
OL,14,FRooney said she came to the conclusion
OL,15,Fby posting fake stories on her private
OL,16,FInstagram account - stories only
OL,17,FVardy's account could see. These
OL,18,Fincluded claims about a trip to Mexico
OL,19,Ffor "gender selection" treatment, a
OL,20,Freturn to TV, and a flooded basement
OL,21,Fat her home.

OL,7,FVardy denied being the source and sued

OL,10,FBut in 2022, a High Court judge ruled
OL,11,Fthat Rooney's claim was "substantially
OL,12,Ftrue" and said it was "likely" Vardy's
OL,13,Fagent had leaked the stories. The
OL,14,Fjudge also found that Vardy had "knew
OL,15,Fof and condoned" her agent's actions.
OL,17,FVardy lost the case and was ordered to
OL,18,Fpay 90% of Rooney's legal costs,
OL,19,Fincluding an initial #800,000. That
OL,20,Fbill has since been disputed.
