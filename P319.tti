OL,3,CRising Bills & Pension Fears: How To
OL,4,CSave Money
OL,6,FThis month we've seen a number of
OL,7,Fhousehold bills go up considerably for
OL,8,Fmillions of us. From energy to council
OL,9,Ftax, how much they've risen varies,
OL,10,Fbut in some cases it's the biggest
OL,11,Fincrease in decades. So with our
OL,12,Fbudgets already stretched by the cost
OL,13,Fof living, what will the impact be?
OL,14,FAnd is there anything we can do to
OL,15,Fsoften the blow?
OL,17,FPrice increases at the start of the
OL,18,Ffinancial year are normal.. But these
OL,19,Frises are set to hit most of us
OL,20,Fespecially hard.
