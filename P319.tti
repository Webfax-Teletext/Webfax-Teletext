OL,6,FWe've had the warmest start of May on
OL,7,Frecord - 29C was recorded in Kew
OL,8,FGardens, London. A little wafty high
OL,9,Fcloud prevented us from climbing to
OL,10,F30C.
OL,12,FMore cloud overnight meant that
OL,13,Ftemperatures didn't slide below 15-
OL,14,F16C. If this had been a leap year or
OL,15,F24 hours earlier, Thursday night would
OL,16,Fhave been one of the warmest nights
OL,17,Fthis early on in the year.
OL,19,FIt's also been muggy - the humid air
OL,20,Fmaking for an even warmer feel.

OL,11,FOur top sunniest Aprils have been in
