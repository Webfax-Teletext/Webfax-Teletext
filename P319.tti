OL,7,Fout and predict the , as the film
OL,8,Fworld's famous faces compete for the
OL,9,Findustry's last coveted prizes.
OL,11,FThere would appear to be one obvious
OL,12,Fstandout success story in Oppenheimer,
OL,13,Fbut this is the and surprises are
OL,14,Fpossible - remember Coda?
OL,16,FSo, here goes.
OL,18,FOppenheimer is the strong favourite to
OL,19,Fwin here, capping a film season where
OL,20,Fit has rightly been lauded and
OL,21,Fgarlanded.

OL,6,FMy personal favourite film is the
OL,7,Fextraordinary The Zone of Interest, a
OL,8,Ffilm that will always stay with me for
OL,9,Fits quiet power and brilliant
OL,10,Fcraftsmanship.
OL,12,FIt will, I think, win Best
OL,13,FInternational Film for Britain this

OL,16,FBest director
OL,18,FI think they may as well give this to
OL,19,FChristopher Nolan now. No other
OL,20,Fdirector has come close this awards

OL,6,FDespite multiple nominations, this

OL,8,Fthe Oscar for directing. Many people
OL,9,Fin that auditorium will be glad to see

OL,6,FI think the Academy will give this one
OL,7,Fto Lily Gladstone from Killers Of The
OL,8,FFlower Moon, making her the first
OL,9,FNative American woman to get this
OL,10,Fhonour.
OL,12,FIt will also send out the right

OL,14,Fstill in the process of tackling their
OL,15,Fdiversity issues. She will certainly
OL,16,Fbe a worthy winner regardless of that.
OL,18,FThere is a chance that Emma Stone from

OL,20,FLily have been dividing the spoils

OL,6,FMy personal favourite is Britain's
OL,7,FCarey Mulligan. Her performance in
OL,8,FMaestro was, I think, head and
OL,9,Fshoulders above her competition.
OL,11,FThis is surely Ireland's Cillian

OL,13,Fout favourite.
OL,15,FI think he will be a worthy winner but
OL,16,FPaul Giamatti from The Holdovers would
OL,17,Falso deserve a win in my book. I've
OL,18,Fbeen cheering him on all season and he
OL,19,Fdeserves to get his Oscar. It's
OL,20,Fbetween the two.
