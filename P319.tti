OL,6,FThe president of Georgia said she
OL,7,Frefuses to recognise the country's
OL,8,Fparliamentary election results, urging
OL,9,Fpeople to take part in protests.
OL,11,FPresident Salome Zourabichvili said a
OL,12,F"Russian special operation" influenced
OL,13,Fthe outcome of the election, which saw
OL,14,Fthe ruling party, Georgian Dream,
OL,15,Fsecure 54.8% of Saturday's vote.
OL,17,FShe urged Georgians to take to the
OL,18,Fstreets to refute the results, calling
OL,19,Fthem a "total falsification, a total
OL,20,Fstealing of your votes".
