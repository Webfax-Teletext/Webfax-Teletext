OL,3,CWhat is the prorogation of Parliament

OL,6,FWhat is prorogation?
OL,8,FProrogation marks the end of a
OL,9,Fparliamentary session, suspending most
OL,10,Fbusiness - including bills, motions,
OL,11,Fdebate and questions.
OL,13,FParliament is usually prorogued
OL,14,Fbetween each session, typically in
OL,15,FApril or May.
OL,17,FBut, as is the case in this instance,
OL,18,Fit may happen prior to dissolution
OL,19,Fbefore a General Election.
