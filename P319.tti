OL,7,FITV News Science Correspondent Martin
OL,8,FStew explains the science behind the
OL,9,Fpower outage in Spain and Portugal
OL,11,FPortugal's grid operator, RNA, gave a
OL,12,Frather complicated explanation for
OL,13,FMonday's massive power outage which
OL,14,Fleft much of the Iberian Peninsula
OL,15,Fwithout power.
OL,17,FIt blamed a rare atmospheric
OL,18,Fphenomenon which caused "oscillations"
OL,19,Fand "vibrations" in the high power
OL,20,Flines, which in turn resulted in
OL,21,F"synchronisation failures".

OL,7,FREN said: "Due to extreme temperature
OL,8,Fvariations in the interior of Spain,
OL,9,Fthere were anomalous oscillations in
OL,10,Fthe very high voltage lines (400 kV),
OL,11,Fa phenomenon known as 'induced
OL,12,Fatmospheric vibration'. These
OL,13,Foscillations caused synchronisation
OL,14,Ffailures between the electrical
OL,15,Fsystems, leading to successive
OL,16,Fdisturbances across the interconnected
OL,17,FEuropean network."
OL,19,FWhat does that actually mean?

OL,7,FIn certain weather conditions where

OL,10,Fvisibly swing.
OL,12,FThat can cause things to physically
OL,13,Fbreak or snap.
OL,15,FThe bigger problem is if the ionised

OL,17,Finteract with the cable itself. That
