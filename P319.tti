OL,6,FUnlike a motion of no-confidence in

OL,12,FUntil this morning, it was considered

OL,3,CVaughan Gething: what could happen if

OL,6,FThere is growing concern within the

OL,8,Fto cut through with voters. In an ITV
OL,9,FWales poll published this week, 57% of
OL,10,Frespondents said they believe Vaughan
OL,11,FGething is performing badly, with 15%
OL,12,Fsaying that he is performing well.
OL,14,FThe first minister has insisted he
OL,15,Fhasn't broken any rules and he's been
OL,16,Fbacked by the UK party leader . But
OL,17,Fwill that support continue if the
