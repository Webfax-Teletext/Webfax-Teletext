OL,6,FThe morning after the historic ousting
OL,7,Fof Michel Barnier, the smoke has
OL,8,Fcleared - but visibility has barely
OL,9,Fimproved.
OL,11,FIn normal times, if a prime minister
OL,12,Fcannot command a majority, you find
OL,13,Fone who can. And if you still can't
OL,14,Ffind one, you call an election.
OL,15,FNeither of those things appear to be
OL,16,Fpossible.
OL,18,FBarnier will, it seems, stay on as
OL,19,Fcaretaker (a country must have a
OL,20,Fgovernment after all) until President
OL,21,FEmmanuel Macron can find someone else.
