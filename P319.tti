OL,6,FSo far spring has felt turbulent in
OL,7,Fterms of the temperatures we've seen,
OL,8,Fwith highs close to 20C that then
OL,9,Fplummet to lows of -8C during the
OL,10,Fnight.
OL,12,FSo why has the temperature been so
OL,13,Fchangeable, and when can we expect the
OL,14,Fweather to warm up for good?
OL,16,FWhat is temperature whiplash?
OL,18,FTemperature whiplash is a stark and
OL,19,Fquick temperature contrast - something
OL,20,Fwe see every spring but is
OL,21,Fparticularly noticeable this year.

OL,6,FWe started the month on a very mild,
OL,7,Fincreasingly warm and sunny theme,
OL,8,Fwith temperatures climbing close to
OL,9,F20C.
OL,11,FWithin 48 hours temperatures then took
OL,12,Fa nose dive as colder, Arctic air
OL,13,Farrived from the north.
OL,15,FWe've had very chilly air since and
OL,16,Fhad some of our coldest March nights
OL,17,Ffor several years with overnight lows
OL,18,Fof -8C.

OL,15,FIt also marks the Spring Equinox where

OL,17,Fnature's first day of spring.
OL,19,FWith increased daylight hours there'll

OL,3,CWhat is temperature whiplash and is
OL,4,Cwarmer weather on the way?
OL,6,FIs it happening more frequently?
OL,8,FThe broader term 'weather whiplash'
OL,9,Fdescribes an abrupt gear change in
OL,10,Fextreme and often unseasonable weather
OL,11,Fconditions.
OL,13,FThis can include huge swings in
OL,14,Ftemperature as we've seen this month.
OL,16,FThese can be caused by a prolonged
OL,17,Fcold spell followed by exceptional
OL,18,Fwarmth or precipitation, a shift from
OL,19,Fan extended dry spell to relentless,
OL,20,Fpersistent rain, or even an erroneous
OL,21,Fone-off unseasonable weather situation.
