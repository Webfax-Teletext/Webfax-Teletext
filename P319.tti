OL,6,FWhy is the Government embarking on the
OL,7,Fbiggest shake-up of local government
OL,8,Fin a generation - and will it be worth
OL,9,Fit? This policy - to abolish dozens of
OL,10,Fcouncils and create larger ones in
OL,11,Ftheir place - has not received as much
OL,12,Fattention as it might, because it is
OL,13,Fsomewhat complicated and occasionally
OL,14,Ftechnical.
OL,16,FBut it does represent an enormous
OL,17,Fshift in the shape and structure of
OL,18,Fcouncils across England. And that
OL,19,Fmakes it highly controversial.

OL,6,FOn Friday, the County Councils Network
OL,7,Fpublished a report saying that this
OL,8,Fradical policy could save the
OL,9,Fgovernment billions of pounds to
OL,10,Finvest in public services.
OL,12,FHowever, the previous day, a survey
OL,13,Ffrom the Local Government Information
OL,14,FUnit cited figures in town halls
OL,15,Fsaying the plans to merge councils are
OL,16,F"ill thought out", "insane" and
OL,17,F"bizarre".
OL,19,FSo what is going on?

OL,6,FThese proposals largely affect the 21

OL,10,FThese areas have one umbrella

OL,15,FBelow that, in the lower tier, are

OL,6,FThe aim is to effectively roll

OL,13,FThe argument is that this simplifies

OL,6,FIn the original white paper for
OL,7,Fdevolution, they cited a PWC report
OL,8,Fthat claimed there could be savings of
OL,9,F#2.9bn.
OL,11,FOne reason for said savings is simple
OL,12,F- if you no longer have multiple
OL,13,Fcouncil chief executives (or a series
OL,14,Fof other senior roles) then you reduce
OL,15,Fyour salary bill a lot.
