OL,11,FThe Terminally Ill Adults (End Of

OL,13,Fmajority of 23 votes on Friday, but
OL,14,Fopponents have vowed to continue their
OL,15,Fresistance in the unelected chamber.
OL,17,FThe legislation could face a difficult

OL,20,Fadd further restrictions and
OL,21,Fsafeguards to the Bill.

OL,7,F"I don't need to teach the House of
