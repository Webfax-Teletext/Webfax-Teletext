OL,6,FTrump told the National Association of

OL,8,Fthat Harris - who is the daughter of
OL,9,FJamaican and Indian parents - had in
OL,10,Fthe past only promoted her Indian

OL,15,Funtil a number of years ago when she
OL,16,Fhappened to turn Black and now she
OL,17,Fwants to be known as Black. So, I
OL,18,Fdon't know, is she Indian or is she
OL,19,FBlack?"

OL,13,F"I think it's disgraceful that I came

OL,19,FThe 78-year-old added that illegal
