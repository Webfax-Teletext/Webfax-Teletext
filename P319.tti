OL,6,FBut the threshold has been criticised
OL,7,Fas unfairly weighted towards single
OL,8,Fparents, as it is based on the income
OL,9,Fof the highest earner.
OL,11,FAdditionally, the rate at which the

OL,13,Ffrom 1% of the child benefit payment
OL,14,Ffor every additional #100 earned above
OL,15,Fthe threshold, to 1% for every #200.
OL,17,FAs a result, child benefit will not be
