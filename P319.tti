OL,6,FEarlier this week, the BMA announced

OL,9,Ffive consecutive days from 7am on July
OL,10,F25, in a dispute over pay.
OL,12,FLord Darzi, 65, told the Times:
OL,13,F"Doctors have a special place in
OL,14,Fsociety. The public's trust in doctors
OL,15,Fis earned, not guaranteed.
OL,17,F"I fear it will never recover if the
OL,18,FBMA go ahead with strikes that are
OL,19,Fplainly unjustifiable."
