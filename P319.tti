OL,6,FThe British Medical Association (BMA)
OL,7,Fsaid on Tuesday that talks with the
OL,8,Fgovernment to avoid the strike had
OL,9,Fcollapsed over the key issue of pay.
OL,11,FDaniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS
OL,12,FProviders, told ITV News: "This is a
OL,13,Fcrushing blow for patients and the
OL,14,FNHS, and the strike is unnecessary and
OL,15,Fnaturally, in my view, it's
OL,16,Firresponsible and reckless.
OL,18,F"The thing that they should do is call
OL,19,Foff the strike and get back around the
OL,20,Fnegotiating table with the government."
