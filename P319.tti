OL,6,FScientists have discovered a new
OL,7,Fspecies of ghost shark at the bottom
OL,8,Fof the ocean near New Zealand.
OL,10,FThe Australasian Narrow-nosed
OL,11,FSpookfish was found in the Chatham
OL,12,FRise, an area of ocean floor off the
OL,13,Feast coast of New Zealand's South
OL,14,FIsland by researchers from the
OL,15,Fcountry's National Institute of Water
OL,16,Fand Atmospheric Research (NIWA).
OL,18,FDr Brit Finucci, a fisheries scientist
OL,19,Fat the institute, said the species -
OL,20,Falso known as Harriotta avia - is a
OL,21,F"lovely chocolate brown colour".

OL,6,F"Harriotta avia is unique due to its
OL,7,Felongated, narrow and depressed snout;
OL,8,Flong, slender trunk; large eyes; and
OL,9,Fvery long, broad pectoral fins," she
OL,10,Fdescribed.
OL,12,FGhost sharks are mostly confined to
OL,13,Fliving on the sea bed at depths of up
OL,14,Fto 2,600 metres (8,530 feet),
OL,15,Fpresenting challenges for researchers.

OL,3,CNew species of ghost shark found on
OL,4,Cocean floor by New Zealand researchers
OL,6,FDr Finucci continued: "Their habitat
OL,7,Fmakes them hard to study and monitor,
OL,8,Fmeaning we don't know a lot about
OL,9,Ftheir biology or threat status, but it
OL,10,Fmakes discoveries like this even more
OL,11,Fexciting."
OL,13,FThe ghost shark, scientifically known
OL,14,Fas chimaera, is a deep water animal
OL,15,Fclosely related to sharks and rays.
OL,17,FThey are mostly made up of cartilage
OL,18,Fand their embryos grow in egg capsules
OL,19,Flaid on the sea floor. Once hatched,
OL,20,Fthey feed off crustaceans such as
OL,21,Fshrimp and molluscs, according to NIWA.

OL,11,FDr Finucci said that she named the new

OL,14,F"Avia means grandmother in Latin. I
