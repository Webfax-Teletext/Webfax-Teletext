OL,6,FNewspaper headlines are warning of a
OL,7,Fsupposed "widespread cold front that
OL,8,Fis moving south from Scandinavia and
OL,9,Fpotentially bringing a 700-mile wall
OL,10,Fof snow that could impact large parts
OL,11,Fof the UK".
OL,13,FTerrifying, right? Yes - and highly
OL,14,Fimprobable. So what's the truth? Is
OL,15,Fthe weather getting colder
OL,17,FYes, that bit is correct. We are
OL,18,Fexpecting a drop in temperatures as
OL,19,Fdominating high pressure drifts away,
OL,20,Fallowing a cold front to sweep across
OL,21,Fthe UK from the north.

OL,6,FSo nothing extraordinary, but it will

OL,11,FHow long will it last?

OL,6,FAny settling snow will probably be

OL,13,FIs this normal?
OL,15,FWeather and temperatures like these
