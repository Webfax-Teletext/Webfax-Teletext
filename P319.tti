OL,7,FReeves Spring Statement next week, the
OL,8,FOECD yesterday highlighted the UK
OL,9,Fgovernment as one of four developed
OL,10,Fcountries facing significant and
OL,11,Fpainful increases in debt costs over
OL,12,Fthe next two years, as a consequence
OL,13,Fof having to refinance large stocks of
OL,14,Fmaturing debt at significantly higher
OL,15,Finterest rate.
OL,17,FIt talks about the UK's "heightened
OL,18,Fvulnerability" because that maturing
OL,19,Fdebt is equivalent in value to more
OL,20,Fthan 15% of GDP.
