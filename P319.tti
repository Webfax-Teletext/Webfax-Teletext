OL,8,Fup and heading off on well-deserved
OL,9,Ftrips to relax and recharge. It's big
OL,10,Fbusiness too, the UK is home to around
OL,11,Ffour and a half thousand holiday parks
OL,12,Fand with over a hundred and fifty
OL,13,Fthousand holiday caravans, for many
OL,14,Fthe thought of owning one is a dream,

OL,6,F"Holiday parks are an unregulated
OL,7,Fsector. There is no regulator who
OL,8,Fcontrols them or ensures that they
OL,9,Fbehave a certain way. What does apply
OL,10,Fthough is consumer law. We do have
OL,11,Fthings like the Consumer Rights Act
OL,12,Fthat means that terms in any of the
OL,13,Fcontracts must be fair. We've got
OL,14,Fconsumer protection from unfair
OL,15,Ftrading regulations and we have the
OL,16,FMisrepresentation Act. So all of these
OL,17,Fthings are things that can be enforced
OL,18,Fagainst parks if they missell. The
OL,19,Fproblem is that sometimes taking an
OL,20,Forganization to court, particularly an
OL,21,Forganization with deep pockets, can be
OL,22,Fquite daunting. It can be expensive,
