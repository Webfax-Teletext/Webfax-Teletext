OL,7,FThe father of a 14-year-old girl who
OL,8,Fwas sexually assaulted by an asylum
OL,9,Fseeker in Essex said he has received
OL,10,Fan apology from David Lammy ` but is
OL,11,Fstill looking for answers.
OL,13,FAfter weeks of waiting, the father
OL,14,Ffinally met with the deputy PM on
OL,15,FThursday, telling ITV News he hoped it
OL,16,Fwould bring him "some closure."
