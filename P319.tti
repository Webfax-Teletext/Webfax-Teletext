OL,7,Fplace 25% tariffs on imports from
OL,8,FCanada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on
OL,9,Fgoods from China effective Saturday.
OL,11,FTrump had been threatening the tariffs
OL,12,Fto ensure greater cooperation from the
OL,13,Fcountries on stopping illegal
OL,14,Fimmigration and the smuggling of
OL,15,Fchemicals used for fentanyl, but he
OL,16,Fhas also pledged to use tariffs to
OL,17,Fboost domestic manufacturing and raise
OL,18,Frevenues for the federal government.
