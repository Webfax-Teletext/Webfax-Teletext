OL,6,FResidents of the Outer Hebrides have
OL,7,Freportedly been plagued by a
OL,8,Fmysterious low-frequency hum, which
OL,9,Fthey say has caused people to suffer
OL,10,Ffrom headaches and dizziness.
OL,12,FA support group on Facebook, which now
OL,13,Fhas more than 500 members, was set up
OL,14,Fto support residents of the Isle of
OL,15,FLewis who have been affected by the
OL,16,Fnoise, dubbed the "Hebridean Hum".
OL,18,FIslanders have taken it upon
OL,19,Fthemselves to investigate the cause of
OL,20,Fthe constant hum, which residents say
OL,21,Fcan be heard day and night.

OL,6,FDr Lauren-Grace Kirtley, a senior

OL,8,Fset up the support page, said the
OL,9,Fsound, which has been "intermittent"
OL,10,Fsince February 2025, has recently
OL,11,Fbecome "loud, constant, and intrusive."
OL,13,F"The sound has been measured at 50
OL,14,FHertz using a spectrograph. This
OL,15,Ffrequency falls below the hearing
OL,16,Frange of many people, but is known to
OL,17,Fbe man-made in origin and can be
OL,18,Fextremely disturbing for those who are
