OL,9,FBelieve it or not, the famously

OL,11,Funexpected role in driving up the
OL,12,Fprice of your coffee.
OL,14,FWhile inflation and environmental

OL,16,Fto rising coffee prices, durian has
OL,17,Fadded a surprising twist to the story.

OL,4,Cmaking your coffee more expensive
OL,6,FVietnam, one of the largest coffee
OL,7,Fproducers in the world, has seen a
OL,8,Fgrowing number of farmers abandoning
OL,9,Fcoffee in favour of durian. The
OL,10,Freason? Durian is far more profitable.
OL,12,FThis shift in agriculture is happening
OL,13,Fat a time when the global coffee
OL,14,Fmarket is already strained by
OL,15,Fenvironmental challenges, making your
OL,16,Fcup of coffee more expensive than ever.

OL,4,Cmaking your coffee more expensive
OL,6,FVietnam is known for producing robusta
OL,7,Fbeans, a key ingredient in many
OL,8,Finstant and affordable coffee blends.
OL,9,FBut over the past few years, many
OL,10,Ffarmers have turned their attention to
OL,11,Fgrowing durian instead.
OL,13,FThe "king of fruits," as durian is

OL,15,Fcommands high prices in international
OL,16,Fmarkets, particularly in China, where
OL,17,Fdemand is soaring.
