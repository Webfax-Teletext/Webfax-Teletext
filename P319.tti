OL,7,FFootage filmed over several days and
OL,8,Fsent to ITV News by one of the last
OL,9,Fjournalists to leave Rafah shows how
OL,10,FIsraeli bombardment has turned the

OL,12,Fdeathtrap for men, women, children and
OL,13,Fwhole families, as ITV News Reporter
OL,14,FChloe Keedy explains
OL,16,FThe streets of Rafah are almost
OL,17,Fcompletely deserted, but Abdullah
OL,18,Fkeeps driving because he has a job to

OL,7,FThe siren blasting from his fire
OL,8,Fengine suggests he is rushing to help
OL,9,Fthe injured, but, all too often these
OL,10,Fdays, he is going to collect the dead.
OL,12,FThere is little life left in Rafah
OL,13,Fnow. Outside a makeshift mortuary,
OL,14,Fpeople pull up in cars with their
OL,15,Fboots filled with bodies.
OL,17,FThey work together to lift and lower
OL,18,Fthem carefully into plastic body bags.
OL,19,FIt is up to the living to try and
OL,20,Fprovide whatever dignity they can for
OL,21,Fthe dead.
