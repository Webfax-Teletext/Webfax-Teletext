OL,14,Fsays it's an important step,

OL,8,Fmaking the parallel move, but it's
OL,9,Fstill vital that a Palestinian state
OL,10,Fis finally recognised.
OL,12,F"The recognition is an
OL,13,Facknowledgement, a step of trying to
OL,14,Ffix things in the proper way," he said.
OL,16,FBut he also urged the UK to go
OL,17,Ffurther, saying Britain can "do much
OL,18,Fmore in a practical sense, in order to
OL,19,Fgive the recognition more teeth."
