OL,8,Fnight.
OL,10,FHundreds were gathered in the dark of
OL,11,Fevening before the looming edifice of
OL,12,Fthe Basilica, as they have done night
OL,13,Fafter night, to say the rosary to pray
OL,14,Ffor the health of Pope Francis.
OL,16,FBefore the prayers began - news that
OL,17,FPope Francis had sent a recorded
OL,18,Fmessage from his hospital bed.

OL,7,Fdisappeared from view. With double
OL,8,Fpneumonia, the leader of the world's
OL,9,F1.4 billion Roman Catholics has been
OL,10,Fin mortal danger.
OL,12,FAs he has struggled for breath, the
OL,13,FChurch has been holding hers.
OL,15,FBut as he marked his 12 years as
OL,16,FPontiff this week, there has been good
OL,17,Fnews. Francis' doctors say he is out
OL,18,Fof danger.

OL,6,FNote that they haven't said he is
OL,7,Fcured of pneumonia - but for now and
OL,8,Fpossibly for some time, it looks as
OL,9,Fthough he has turned a corner.
OL,11,FSo, the questions turn from whether he
OL,12,Fmight survive to what this means for
OL,13,Fhis papacy. There is predictably
OL,14,Ffeverish speculation he may choose to
OL,15,Fstand down - a precedent set by his
OL,16,Fpredecessor, Pope Benedict.
OL,18,FBut papal biographer Austen Ivereigh,
OL,19,Fwho knows Pope Francis, tells me we
OL,20,Fabsolutely should not jump to that
OL,21,Fconclusion.

OL,6,FHe points out that illness is simply
OL,7,Fpart of the papacy. The Catholic norm
OL,8,Fis that a pope ages, gets ill, and
OL,9,Feither recovers or dies.
OL,11,FIvereigh adds that in the depths of
OL,12,Fgreat sickness, Pope Francis is
OL,13,Fadapting his papacy - his raspy,
OL,14,Fweakened voice no less potent. He is
OL,15,Fnow a Pope in full bodied solidarity
OL,16,Fwith the sick and frail.

OL,6,FA full return to the globe-trotting
OL,7,FFrancis may be a stretch - but it is
OL,8,Fentirely possible he can craft a new
OL,9,Fchapter of his pontificate:
OL,10,Fcommunicating regularly with his
