OL,6,FMr Farage suggested the drop in
OL,7,Fsupport had nothing to do with his
OL,8,Fcomments about the West "provoking"
OL,9,FRussia to invade Ukraine. Instead he
OL,10,Fblamed numerous reports about
OL,11,Fhistorical remarks made by some Reform
OL,12,FUK candidates.
OL,14,F"The other thing that perhaps had a
OL,15,Fbigger impact is, we've just had too
OL,16,Fmany candidates who've said stupid
OL,17,Fthings," said the Reform UK leader.
OL,19,F"I think that's perhaps the reason
OL,20,Fthat we dropped off a little bit."
