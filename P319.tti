OL,10,FExperts at the University of Exeter
OL,11,Flooked at different ways of deterring
OL,12,Fthe birds from approaching a box of
OL,13,Fchips on the ground.
OL,15,FThey played either a recording of a
OL,16,Fmale voice shouting the words "No,
OL,17,Fstay away, that's my food", the same
OL,18,Fvoice speaking those words, or the
OL,19,F'neutral' birdsong of a robin to 61
OL,20,Fherring gulls across nine seaside
OL,21,Ftowns in Cornwall.

OL,6,FThey found nearly half of those gulls
OL,7,Fexposed to the shouting voice flew
OL,8,Faway within a minute.
OL,10,FOnly 15% of the gulls exposed to the
OL,11,Fspeaking male voice flew away, while
OL,12,Fthe rest walked away from the food,
OL,13,Fstill sensing danger.
OL,15,FIn contrast, 70% of gulls exposed to

OL,6,FDr Neeltje Boogert, of the Centre for
OL,7,FEcology and Conservation at Exeter's
OL,8,FPenryn Campus in Cornwall, said: "The
OL,9,Fdifference was that the gulls were
OL,10,Fmore likely to fly away at the
OL,11,Fshouting and more likely to walk away
OL,12,Fat the speaking.
OL,14,F"So when trying to scare off a gull
OL,15,Fthat's trying to steal your food,
OL,16,Ftalking might stop them in their
OL,17,Ftracks but shouting is more effective
OL,18,Fat making them fly away."

OL,6,FThe recordings, in which five male

OL,8,Fcalm voice and, separately, in a
OL,9,Fshouting voice, were adjusted to be at
OL,10,Fthe same volume, which suggests gulls

OL,6,FDr Boogert said: "Normally when
OL,7,Fsomeone is shouting, it's scary
OL,8,Fbecause it's a loud noise, but in this
OL,9,Fcase all the noises were the same
OL,10,Fvolume, and it was just the way the
OL,11,Fwords were being said that was
OL,12,Fdifferent.
OL,14,F"So it seems that gulls pay attention
OL,15,Fto the way we say things, which we
OL,16,Fdon't think has been seen before in
OL,17,Fany wild species, only in those
OL,18,Fdomesticated species that have been
OL,19,Fbred around humans for generations,
OL,20,Fsuch as dogs, pigs and horses."

OL,10,F"Most gulls aren't bold enough to
