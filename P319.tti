OL,5,FWith kitchens across the country now
OL,6,Fwhirring to the sound of air fryers
OL,7,Fand new models being released every
OL,8,Fmonth, some are beginning to wonder
OL,9,Fhow long this craze will last and what
OL,10,Fimpact it might have. Scott Butler
OL,11,Ffrom Recycle Your Electricals looked
OL,12,Finto how many of these appliances are
OL,13,Fgathering dust, with some shocking
OL,14,Ffindings. They told Tonight a whopping
OL,15,F764,000 air fryers aren't being used
OL,16,Fand a further 1.5 million have been
OL,17,Fthrown away. Meaning over 2.25 million
OL,18,Fair fryers are being unused or
OL,19,Fdiscarded that could otherwise be

OL,5,FScott told Tonight: "If you've got an
OL,6,Fair fryer that is still working and
OL,7,Fyou no longer need it try and sell
OL,8,Fthem, try and donate them, definitely
OL,9,Frecycle them because the material
OL,10,Fthat's sat inside of them can do good
OL,11,Fsomewhere else."
OL,13,FHe said that these gadgets might have
OL,14,Frevolutionised our kitchens, but they
OL,15,Fcan go on to make huge changes
OL,16,Felsewhere once recycled; "It's full of
OL,17,Fsteel, aluminum, plastics, sometimes
