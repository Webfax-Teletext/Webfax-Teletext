OL,9,Fin Gaza.
OL,11,FSince launching operations in May,
OL,12,FGHF's large-scale distribution sites -
OL,13,Fbacked by Israel and the US - have
OL,14,Fbecome magnets for violence.
OL,16,FNearly 1,400 people have died while
OL,17,Fseeking food; 859 in the vicinity of
OL,18,Fthe GHF sites and 514 along the routes

OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV News, GHF spokesperson
OL,7,FChapin Fay claims there have been no
OL,8,Fcasualties on any of the group's four
OL,9,Faid sites and claims the numbers

OL,12,F"We have had no casualties on our
OL,13,Fsites. We have never had any
OL,14,Fcasualties except for two incidents of
OL,15,Fterrorist attacks."
OL,17,FThe UN recorded deaths are often
OL,18,Fattributed to Israeli fire - including
OL,19,Fgunshots and teargas - while the GHF
OL,20,Fhas also been criticised for crowd
OL,21,Fcontrol incidents and stampedes.
