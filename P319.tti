OL,6,FSummer has been a let down so far.
OL,8,FThe first half of June was
OL,9,Funseasonably cool and chilly, but it
OL,10,Fcheered up a touch later in the month,
OL,11,Falbeit short-lived.
OL,13,FThen, a brief warm spell lifted

OL,6,FJuly has been dreadful so far and many
OL,7,Fsummer events have been a washout -
OL,8,Fincluding a very damp Wimbledon.
OL,10,FThe rain has been blamed for one of
OL,11,Fthe lowest attendance figures in years
OL,12,F- not to mention the struggle to get
OL,13,Ftickets even when the weather is more
OL,14,Ffitting.
OL,16,FTogether, with brisk winds and cooler
OL,17,Fconditions than you'd expect in mid-

OL,19,Fthunderstorms in place for the next 48

OL,6,FWhat's happened to our summer?
OL,8,FThe disappointing conditions have been
OL,9,Fdriven by a serious lack of high
OL,10,Fpressure systems, which would usually
OL,11,Fencourage fine, settled sunny weather
OL,12,Fand in turn some much needed warmth.
OL,14,FWith the sun so strong this time of
OL,15,Fyear , it wouldn't take much for
OL,16,Ftemperatures to bounce up, but sadly
OL,17,Fwe've had little opportunity.
OL,19,FThis is largely down to the jet stream
OL,20,Fsitting further south.
