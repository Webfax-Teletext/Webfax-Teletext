OL,4,Cfacilities 'destroyed'
OL,6,FThe boss of the US spy agency has said
OL,7,Frecent US strikes on Iran's nuclear
OL,8,Finfrastructure caused long-term
OL,9,Fdamage, a day after a leaked report
OL,10,Fclaimed they had had limited impact.
OL,12,FCIA Director John Ratcliffe said the
OL,13,Fagency had obtained "a body of
OL,14,Fcredible evidence" showing that key
OL,15,FIranian nuclear facilities were
OL,16,F"destroyed" in the strikes and would
OL,17,Fneed to be rebuilt "over the course of
OL,18,Fyears." It was not clear whether
OL,19,FRatcliffe was offering an official
OL,20,Fagency assessment or his view of the
OL,21,Fintelligence.

OL,6,FThe strikes, carried out on Saturday,
OL,7,Ftargeted three major sites - Natanz,
OL,8,FFordow, and Isfahan - and were
OL,9,Fintended to wipe out Iran's nuclear
OL,10,Fcapabilities.
OL,12,FHours after the attack, US president
OL,13,FDonald Trump claimed the raid had left
OL,14,FIran's nuclear facilities "completely
OL,15,Fand fully obliterated", but the leaked
OL,16,Fpreliminary assessment from the
OL,17,FDefence Intelligence Agency (DIA) on
OL,18,FWednesday cast doubt on the extent of
OL,19,Fthe damage. That analysis suggested
OL,20,FIran's programme may only have been
OL,21,Fset back by a matter of months.

OL,11,FTrump strongly pushed back on the
OL,12,Fleaked assessment, insisting the
OL,13,Fstrikes had delivered a "crushing
OL,14,Fblow" and "obliterated" Iran's ability
OL,15,Fto produce a nuclear weapon. "This was
OL,16,Fa devastating attack, and it knocked
OL,17,Fthem for a loop," he said.
OL,19,FThe White House, along with director
OL,20,Fof National Intelligence Tulsi
OL,21,FGabbard, echoed Trump's view.
