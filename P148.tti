OL,6,GLast week's changes to the Digital 3
OL,7,Gand 4 multiplex could point the way to
OL,8,Ga more sustainable future for Freeview.
OL,10,FI have long argued that the day when
OL,11,Fdigital terrestrial TV can
OL,12,Frealistically be turned off is a long
OL,13,Fway into the future.
OL,15,FEven if Freely proves a big success `
OL,16,Fand there are many advantages to
OL,17,Finternet delivery ` turning off
OL,18,FFreeview can only be contemplated once
OL,19,Fthere is little risk of disadvantaging
OL,20,Fconsumers.

OL,11,F` primarily used to carry ITV 1,
OL,12,FChannel 4 and 5 from every transmitter

OL,15,FEssentially changing to a different

OL,19,FThat in turn has allowed Channel 4 to
OL,20,Fmove 4Seven on to that multiplex.

OL,6,FIt means C4 is no longer hiring

OL,10,FThe big unknown is how many viewers
OL,11,Fwith older equipment lost access to

OL,17,FThat's TV 3.
