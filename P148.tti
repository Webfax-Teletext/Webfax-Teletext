OL,6,
OL,7,F In 1986, News Afternoon had a small
OL,8,Fset for its last couple of weeks `
OL,9,Fpresumably because the set for the new
OL,10,FOne o'Clock News was taking up its old
OL,11,Fspace.
OL,12,F During the 1987 election campaign,
OL,13,Fthe One lost some studio space ` the
OL,14,Fmost obvious impact of this was on the
OL,15,Fzoom at the end of the titles. This
OL,16,Fwas, I presume, because of the large
OL,17,Fset being used for the News and
OL,18,FElection 87 at 9pm.
OL,19,F In 1988 the daytime summaries used a
OL,20,FCSO backdrop of the newsroom while
OL,21,Fwork was underway building a full
OL,22,Fnewsroom studio for the Nine.

OL,9,FThe changes weren't immediately

OL,6,FBut I have argued before that this is
OL,7,Fnot 1970. There is nothing wrong in

OL,9,Fdifferent styles for links. The normal
OL,10,Fset for the Six and Ten allows the

OL,15,FFor now, at least, there are
