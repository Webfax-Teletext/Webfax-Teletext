OL,3,CWhat has AQoS axe got to do with

OL,6,GThe BBC's financial woes are no

OL,8,Gend of the old BBC News Channel and
OL,9,Gthe changes to Newsnight are the
OL,10,Gdirect result of the falling value of

OL,13,FIt is hard for supporters of the BBC

OL,6,FThe news that the long-running show

OL,8,FFriday evening and made the front

OL,11,FOn first inspection, it may have

OL,9,Fthat the revamp of the programme under

OL,6,FThe actual words used by the BBC were
OL,7,Fcareful ` they simply described,
OL,8,Fcorrectly, the situation facing

OL,10,Fin the industry and prioritising

OL,13,FBut the impression was clear ` if the

OL,6,FThe decision to abandon afternoon
