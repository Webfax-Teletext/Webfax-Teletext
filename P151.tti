OL,7,Golder Sky SD satellite receivers, Sky
OL,8,Ghas been quietly reducing the

OL,12,FThis week, a number of interactive

OL,5,FIn terms of functionality, the writing

OL,7,FNew apps were not made available on

OL,9,Fwithdraw existing services.
OL,11,FEarlier this year Sky opted to
OL,12,Fbroadcast extra streams from the US
OL,13,Fopen online only ` that meant that
OL,14,Fviewers using older receivers lost out
OL,15,Fon extra coverage. That's despite the

OL,17,Fextra streams via satellite and could
OL,18,Fhave done so for the US Open tennis.
