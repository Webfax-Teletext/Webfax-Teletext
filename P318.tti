OL,6,FHe didn't get to bed until 7.30 this
OL,7,Fmorning he tells me, as he was busy
OL,8,Fediting the visual screen display
OL,9,Fwhich is the backdrop to the stage.
OL,11,FThe thing is, Jacob Collier is quite
OL,12,Fcapable of doing pretty much
OL,13,Feverything connected with music - he's
OL,14,Fdubbed the Mozart of Gen Z - and ever
OL,15,Fsince he was discovered online and
OL,16,Fmentored by the late producer Quincy
OL,17,FJones, he has proved he's something
OL,18,Fspecial.
