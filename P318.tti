OL,6,FSuccessive UK governments promised to
OL,7,Ftackle the people smuggling industry.
OL,8,FPrime Minister Keir Starmer wants to
OL,9,F"smash the gangs," Rishi Sunak wanted
OL,10,Fto "stop the boats".
OL,12,FFrom what the ITV News team in Dunkirk
OL,13,Fwitnessed on Tuesday, the efforts of
OL,14,FFrench police do not match the cunning
OL,15,Fof the smugglers, or the desperation
OL,16,Fof those willing to risk their lives
OL,17,Fagain and again.
OL,19,FIn the hour before sunrise - for the
OL,20,Fsecond day in a row here in Dunkirk -
OL,21,Fwe saw a dinghy carrying migrants.

OL,9,FThis was not a fast getaway across the

OL,14,FPolice were nowhere to be seen on this

OL,14,FWe hear shouts of encouragement and

OL,10,FIt was only after the last migrant was
