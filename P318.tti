OL,7,FMatthew Drapper told ITV News he was
OL,8,Fled to believe demons had left his
OL,9,Fmouth during the intense prayer
OL,10,Fsession at St Thomas Philadelphia
OL,11,FChurch in Sheffield in 2014.
OL,13,F"They said that one of the reactions
OL,14,Fyou'll have is that when people are
OL,15,Fpraying for you to get rid of the
OL,16,Fdemonic influence, you'll want to
OL,17,Fstop. And that's a sign that you
OL,18,Fshould carry on and that you should
OL,19,Fpush through. And they said you might
OL,20,Fhave a physical reaction", he said
OL,21,Fdescribing the prayer session.
