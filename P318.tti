OL,7,FPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has
OL,8,Fignored calls to apologise to civil
OL,9,Fservants after facing accusations he
OL,10,Fused "Trumpian" language to describe
OL,11,Fthem.
OL,13,FIn a major speech on Thursday, the
OL,14,Fprime minister claimed too many people
OL,15,Fin Whitehall are "comfortable in the
OL,16,Ftepid bath of managed decline", though
OL,17,Fhe insisted he did not think there was
OL,18,Fa "swamp to be drained here".
