OL,7,Fof Westminster have been presented to
OL,8,FMPs and peers, with one option
OL,9,Fexpected to rack up a bill of nearly

OL,12,FTwo options have been put forward: one
OL,13,Ffor a "full decant", which would see
OL,14,Fboth houses of parliament move out of
OL,15,Fthe Palace of Westminster while works
OL,16,Ftake place; and another where the
OL,17,Fpalace would be worked on in stages.

OL,6,FThe first would last 19 to 24 years

OL,13,FAt present, #1.5 million is spent per
