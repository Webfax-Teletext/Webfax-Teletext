OL,6,FBoth the US and Europe have been hit
OL,7,Fby a naturally occurring weather
OL,8,Fphenomenon known as a heat dome,
OL,9,Fbringing record breaking temperatures
OL,10,Fas a result.
OL,12,FA heat dome occurs when an area of
OL,13,Fhigh pressure forms over a large
OL,14,Fregion. This can then act like a lid,
OL,15,Fpreventing hot air from rising and
OL,16,Fgradually heating up the ground below
