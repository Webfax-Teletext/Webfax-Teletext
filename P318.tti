OL,7,FNet migration is the difference
OL,8,Fbetween the number of people coming in
OL,9,Fto the country, and the number
OL,10,Fleaving. It hit a record high of
OL,11,F745,000 in 2022, and despite falling
OL,12,Fby 10% in 2023 to 685,000 - the number
OL,13,Fremains three times higher than in
OL,14,F2019.
OL,16,FRishi Sunak has joined his
OL,17,Fpredecessors in saying he wants the
OL,18,Ffigure to come down, committing on
OL,19,FTuesday to what he calls an
OL,20,F'Immigration Lock' - an annual cap on

OL,15,FIn 2011 he doubled down on this,
OL,16,Fsaying he would hit the target by 2015

OL,19,Fhad risen to 379,000.
