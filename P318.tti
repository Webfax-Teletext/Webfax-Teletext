OL,7,Fhotel - described by one of Nigel

OL,9,F- and the Reform UK leader is waiting
OL,10,Fto make his entrance.
OL,12,FIt is a carefully choreographed
OL,13,Froutine. Eminem's 'Without Me' rings
OL,14,Fout in the hall, which is filled with
OL,15,F600 Farage supporters.
OL,17,FThe question in the lyrics - 'Guess

OL,19,Fimmediately as the Reform UK leader
OL,20,Fbegins his walk onto the stage as if a
