OL,12,FHere's what is being investigated and

OL,15,Fis it being investigated?JThe UK's
OL,16,Ffinancial regulator, the Financial
OL,17,FConduct Authority (FCA), launched a
OL,18,Freview last month into historic
OL,19,Fcommission arrangements in the motor
OL,20,Ffinance market.JIt said it followed a
OL,21,Fhigh number of complaints from
OL,22,Fcustomers to car finance firms. In
OL,23,FJanuary 2021, the FCA banned selling
OL,24,Fpractices known as discretionary

OL,6,FLloyds has come into the spotlight
OL,7,Fbecause it is one of the biggest motor
OL,8,Ffinance providers in the UK through
OL,9,Fits brand Black Horse.JThe bank said
OL,10,Fit is too early to say what the scale
OL,11,Fof any potential redress could be, and
OL,12,Fthat it welcomed the regulator's
OL,13,Finvestigation to get clarity on the
OL,14,Fissue.JMatt Brizman, an equity analyst
OL,15,Ffor Hargreaves Lansdown, said the #450
OL,16,Fmillion charge is "less than some had
OL,17,Ffeared but there will be question
OL,18,Fmarks around how Lloyds has come to
OL,19,Fthat figure".JHe added: "Lloyds has
OL,20,Fbeen honest in saying the outcome of
OL,21,Fthe review is largely unknown. What we
OL,22,Fdo know is that Lloyds is one of the
OL,23,Fmore exposed banks should the FCA deem
OL,24,Fthere was misconduct and customer
OL,25,Floss."

OL,13,Fis therefore also not possible to
