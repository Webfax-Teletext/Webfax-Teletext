OL,4,Cwhat about Gaza?
OL,6,FThis morning, for the first time in
OL,7,Fone year and two months, the people of
OL,8,Fthe northern half of Israel, the
OL,9,Fsouthern half of Lebanon and the
OL,10,Fcitizens of Beirut woke up to peace
OL,11,Fand quiet and the dust settling.
OL,13,FWithin hours of the ceasefire between
OL,14,FIsrael and Hezbollah coming into
OL,15,Feffect, we've seen thousands of
OL,16,FLebanese returning to their abandoned
OL,17,Fhomes in the south.
OL,19,FSomething like a million people in
OL,20,Fthat country were displaced by the war
OL,21,Fthat is now over.

OL,3,CAs Lebanon celebrates a ceasefire,
OL,4,Cwhat about Gaza?
OL,6,FThe ceasefire envisages a 60 day
OL,7,Fimplementation period during which
OL,8,FHezbollah will retreat northwards and
OL,9,Fthe Israelis will withdraw southwards,
OL,10,Feventually leaving Lebanon altogether.
OL,12,FHowever, today, I think it's hard not
OL,13,Fto feel sorry for the citizens of
OL,14,FGaza, for whom there is no ceasefire
OL,15,Fin sight.
OL,17,FAt a human level, they're happy that
OL,18,Fit's over for the Lebanese, but
OL,19,Fthey're lamenting the fact that they,
OL,20,Fthe people of Gaza, are unable to
OL,21,Freturn to their homes.

OL,6,FI think it was interesting that when
OL,7,Fhe announced the Lebanon ceasefire,
OL,8,FPresident Joe Biden said that in the
OL,9,Fcoming days, the United States would
OL,10,Fmake a new push for a Gaza ceasefire,
OL,11,Fone that would include mediators from
OL,12,FTurkey, Egypt and Qatar.
OL,14,FHowever, Mr Biden was unable to secure
OL,15,Fa Gaza ceasefire at the height of his
OL,16,Fpowers.
OL,18,FIt's very difficult to see how he will
OL,19,Fbe able to achieve anything as a lame
OL,20,Fduck president.
