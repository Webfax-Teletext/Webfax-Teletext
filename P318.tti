OL,3,CSuper Hunter's Moon: How to see the
OL,4,Cbiggest and brightest moon of the year
OL,6,FThe next exciting sight to spot in the
OL,7,Fsky is the next full moon, which will
OL,8,Fbe a Hunter's Moon.
OL,10,FThis month's full moon is not only the
OL,11,FHunter's Moon, but also the third of
OL,12,Ffour back-to-back supermoons.
OL,14,FSo what is it and when can you see it?
OL,16,FWhere does it get its name?

OL,3,CSuper Hunter's Moon: How to see the
OL,4,Cbiggest and brightest moon of the year
OL,6,FThe Hunter's Moon used to signal to
OL,7,Ffarmers that it was time to start
OL,8,Fpreparing for winter, and its bright
OL,9,Freflection provided good visibility to
OL,10,Fhunting animals to keep them fed
OL,11,Fthrough the chilly months ahead.
OL,13,F"Animals are beginning to fatten up
OL,14,Fahead of winter, and since the farmers
OL,15,Fhad recently cleaned out their fields
OL,16,Funder the harvest moon, hunters could
OL,17,Feasily see the deer and other animals
OL,18,Fthat had come out to root through the
OL,19,Fremaining scraps," The Old Farmer's
OL,20,FAlmanac said.

OL,6,FThis year's Hunter's Moon will take
OL,7,Fplace on Thursday 17 October, and it
OL,8,Fwill appear like a full moon for three
OL,9,Fdays.
OL,11,F"The reason for that is that although
OL,12,Fit moves further around to the east in
OL,13,Fthe sky, which would mean it rises
OL,14,Flater, the difference is a bit less
OL,15,Fbecause it's also moving north at the
