OL,6,FEven before he had started his make-or-
OL,7,Fbreak press conference, Joe Biden had
OL,8,Fdropped a diplomatic clanger for the
OL,9,Fages.
OL,11,FHe introduced President Zelenskyy as
OL,12,FPresident Putin, before a few seconds
OL,13,Flater realising his excruciating
OL,14,Fmistake and correcting himself.

OL,18,Fthe gaff was beamed to hundreds of
OL,19,Fjournalists.

OL,10,Fhour.
OL,12,FBut it was hardly the tour de force
OL,13,Fthat his allies inside the Democratic

OL,16,FAt times, he rambled and was painfully
