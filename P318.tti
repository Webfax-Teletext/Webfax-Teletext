OL,9,Flike it had "burnt through their skin".
OL,11,FMany assumed the issue was caused by a
OL,12,Fchange in the product's formula, but
OL,13,FMitchum UK confirmed that, after an
OL,14,Finvestigation, the problem was linked
OL,15,Fto the brand adopting a different
OL,16,Fmanufacturing process.
