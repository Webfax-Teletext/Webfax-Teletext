OL,4,Cof last summer - and it's not over yet
OL,6,FThis spring has been exceptional.
OL,8,FSunshine hours are way higher than
OL,9,Faverage. Both March and April were the
OL,10,Fsunniest on record - and May is
OL,11,Flooking to be going the same way.
OL,13,FIt's not only been remarkably sunny
OL,14,Fbut also unusually dry for most of us.
OL,16,FIt's been one of the driest starts to
OL,17,Fthe season in decades - with notably
OL,18,Fno recorded rainfall for huge areas of
OL,19,Fthe country this month - including
OL,20,Fparts of Scotland and northern England.

OL,6,FHit and miss thunderstorms triggered
OL,7,Fby humid air developed in some parts

OL,13,FTemperatures have fluctuated most of

OL,6,FSo far we've seen more sunshine this
OL,7,Fspring (March, April and May) than all
OL,8,Fof last summer (June, July and August)
OL,9,F- quite something as we're only just
OL,10,Fmid way through May.
OL,12,FCurrently our sunniest spring was
OL,13,Fduring lockdown in 2020.
OL,15,FBut if we continue to keep the sunny
OL,16,Fskies this week - as forecast, we're
OL,17,Fon track for this spring clocking up
OL,18,Fmore sunshine hours than the last five
OL,19,Fsummers.
