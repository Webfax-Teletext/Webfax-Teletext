OL,6,FWhat is a partial lunar eclipse?
OL,8,FA partial lunar eclipse happens when
OL,9,Fthe Earth passes between the sun and
OL,10,Fmoon, casting a shadow that darkens a
OL,11,Fsliver of the moon.
OL,13,FAs the partial eclipse involves
OL,14,Fblocking some of the sun's light, the
OL,15,Fmoon will be slightly dimmer than a
OL,16,Fregular supermoon.
OL,18,FThe Earth, moon and sun line up to
OL,19,Fproduce a solar or lunar eclipse
OL,20,Fanywhere from four to seven times a
OL,21,Fyear, according to NASA.
