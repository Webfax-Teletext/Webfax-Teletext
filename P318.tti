OL,6,FITV News Correspondent Lucy Watson met
OL,7,Fwith 12 year-old Abdallah Kehil whose
OL,8,Fleg was saved from amputation after a
OL,9,Frocket landed in front of his school.
OL,10,FHe continues with bravery and
OL,11,Fundiminished dreams to become a model.
OL,13,FThe war in Gaza has continued for
OL,14,Fnearly 11 months, and throughout that
OL,15,Ftime we have heard often about how it
OL,16,Fhas affected its children - who make
OL,17,Fup half of the territory's population.
OL,19,FThey are experiencing death and
OL,20,Fdestruction daily, and quite often,
OL,21,Fwitnessing the unimaginable.

OL,6,FRecently, I went to Egypt to report on
OL,7,Fdesperately ill Palestinians who,
OL,8,Funtil May, were allowed to leave Gaza
OL,9,Fto go to Egypt, and elsewhere, for
OL,10,Fmedical treatment.
OL,12,FOn our last day of filming in Cairo,
OL,13,Fwe were at the Nasser Institute
OL,14,FHospital talking to cancer patients
OL,15,Fand their doctors.
OL,17,FThroughout the day, unbeknownst to us,
OL,18,Fwe were being watched. It was only
OL,19,Fwhen we started to pack up did the
OL,20,Fcurious 12 year old observer make
OL,21,Fhimself known.

OL,6,FHis name was Abdallah Kehil, and his
OL,7,Fresilience and bravery astounded us,
OL,8,Fbut not only us, the Egyptian

OL,11,FAs he moved along the corridors of the

OL,13,FAbdallah had an undeniable popularity

OL,6,FThe other children adored him. He
OL,7,Fsmiled often and they followed him
OL,8,Flike the Pied Piper. But, Abdallah's
OL,9,Fsmile hid horrors no 12 year old
OL,10,Fshould ever see. He wanted to share
OL,11,Fhis own story, about a school day in
OL,12,FNovember.
OL,14,F"We were bombed, a rocket hit us in
OL,15,Ffront of our school," he said.
OL,17,F"We were sitting down and suddenly the
OL,18,Fmissile struck us. My leg was blown
OL,19,Foff. My friends' bodies were
OL,20,Fscattered."

OL,6,FAbdallah crawled along the ground away
OL,7,Ffrom the devastation. Medics found him
OL,8,Fand carried him to hospital where he
OL,9,Fhad to fight for his own life. He'd
OL,10,Flost every one of his friends.
OL,12,FOnce his condition stabilised, he made

OL,14,Fand put it online, asking the Egyptian
OL,15,Fpresident to save his leg.

OL,6,FJust days later, Abdallah and his mum
OL,7,Fwere rescued. Their evacuation was
OL,8,Fshown on Egyptian state television, as
OL,9,Fhe was moved from ambulance to
OL,10,Fambulance, hospital to hospital, until
OL,11,Fhe reached Cairo, and the Nasser
OL,12,FInstitute, where surgeons were waiting.
OL,14,FHe explained to me what they did to
OL,15,Ffix his leg.
OL,17,F"They took a muscle from my back and
OL,18,Fskin from my thigh, to repair my other
OL,19,Fleg. They put it back together as
OL,20,Fnew," he said.

OL,6,FIn January, he was invited by
OL,7,FPresident Abdul Fattah El Sisi to a
OL,8,Fnational event at Cairo's New Capital
OL,9,FTheatre. It was there - on stage -
OL,10,Fthat Abdallah said to the audience, "I
OL,11,Fwish I could hug the President."
OL,13,FAt that point, El Sisi walked up on
OL,14,Fstage and hugged him. His survival
OL,15,Fdefies belief, but so too does his

OL,10,FAbdallah is indeed famous, but he
