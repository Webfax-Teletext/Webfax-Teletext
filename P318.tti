OL,6,FWhen I first arrived in Pacific
OL,7,FPalisades yesterday it was not the
OL,8,Fsmoke or the heat that startled me.
OL,10,FIt was the noise. The deafening sound
OL,11,Fof hundreds of homes going up in
OL,12,Fflames - fanned by ferocious wind -
OL,13,Fwas something I have never experienced.
OL,15,FIt was the noise of vast quantities of
OL,16,Fwood burning, of structures
OL,17,Fcollapsing, of vehicle fuel exploding,
OL,18,Fof the Santa Ana wind raging down the
OL,19,Fcanyons.

OL,6,FIt is here - sandwiched between the
OL,7,Focean and the San Gabriel Mountains -
OL,8,Fwhere some of America's most fabled
OL,9,Fenclaves and gated communities lie.
OL,11,FIt is difficult not to feel immensely
OL,12,Fsorry for the firefighters. They are
OL,13,Fdoing their best to save some
OL,14,Fproperties. But they are being
OL,15,Foverwhelmed by the forces of nature.
OL,17,FNo sooner do they make progress than
OL,18,Fembers ignite the roof of another
OL,19,Fhome. And so it goes on.

OL,6,FIn front of our eyes last night, the
OL,7,Ffires hop-scotched across one
OL,8,Fneighbourhood, and then another.
OL,10,FWe were with Andy Chan, a firefighter
OL,11,Ffrom Long Beach. He told us that the
OL,12,Fpressure in the hydrants was so low
OL,13,Fthat at times they had no water.
OL,15,FBut he kept on battling.
OL,17,FThe town of Palisades - in one of the
OL,18,Fmost beautiful locations imaginable,
OL,19,Foverlooking the waters of the Pacific
OL,20,F- is now a smoking ruin.

OL,6,FThe fire didn't discriminate. It
OL,7,Fconsumed huge mansions along Sunset
OL,8,FBoulevard. It destroyed small
OL,9,Fbusinesses. It ravaged modest homes.
OL,11,FAnd perhaps most devastating of all,
OL,12,Fit took a community that seemed like a
OL,13,Fslice of paradise and turned it into a
OL,14,Fhellscape.
