OL,11,Fcertainly seen the inside of a few
OL,12,Fclubs over the years - from London to
OL,13,FParis to New York, all with their
OL,14,Funique scenes. But the Berlin Techno
OL,15,Fscene does stand apart.

OL,9,FChicago, Techno found a new home in
OL,10,FBerlin at a time when Communism and
OL,11,Fthe infamous Wall, which divided the

OL,14,FEast and West Berliners were free to

OL,7,FOne of those young people was Dimitri
OL,8,FHegemann. Now in his late 60s, he
OL,9,Fopened what is regarded as Berlin's
OL,10,Foldest techno club - Tresor - in 1989.
OL,12,FHe summed it up perfectly when he told
OL,13,Fme that back then, it felt like music
OL,14,F"could change the world".
OL,16,FDecades later he still has that glint
OL,17,Fin his eye, that same spirit of
OL,18,Frebellion and a conviction that
OL,19,FBerlin's techno scene really is
OL,20,Fdifferent from other club capitals.
