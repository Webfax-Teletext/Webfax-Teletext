OL,7,FTwo years ago, at Conservative Party
OL,8,FConference, Rishi Sunak was a prime
OL,9,Fminister still hoping he could rescue
OL,10,Fhis party from electoral doom. His
OL,11,Fministers spent the week being chased
OL,12,Fby journalists shouting questions
OL,13,Fabout an impending announcement to
OL,14,Fcancel HS2 to Manchester... while in
OL,15,FManchester.
OL,17,FIt was frenetic, chaotic and for
OL,18,Fpolitical geeks - it demanded
OL,19,Fattention.

OL,7,FWhen you talk to attendees at this

OL,13,Fwhere the exhibition stands stop short
