OL,11,Fcoming to Gaza. Two years and 2 days
OL,12,Fafter October 7, approximately 70,000
OL,13,Fdeaths later a deal has been done.
OL,15,FThat deal means the release of all 20
OL,16,Fliving hostages at the weekend, along
OL,17,Fwith the return of the bodies of those
OL,18,Fwho did not survive. Hundreds of
OL,19,FPalestinians serving life sentences
OL,20,Fwill be released along with around
OL,21,F1700 detained since October 7th.

OL,7,FSafia, ITV News' cameraman in Gaza.
OL,8,FFor two years he has documented the
OL,9,Fdestruction of his land and the
OL,10,Fkilling of his people. He struggled to
OL,11,Ffind the words to sum up his feelings.
OL,12,F"We have lost so much and so many," he
OL,13,Fsaid.
OL,15,F"But we must find a way to recover and

OL,18,FAs he spoke Israeli attacks continued.
OL,19,FFor so long peace in Palestine has
OL,20,Fseemed illusory, it still feels like
OL,21,Fthat and it may yet prove to be so.
