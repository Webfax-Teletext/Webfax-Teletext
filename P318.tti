OL,7,FThere is a new threat to Los Angeles
OL,8,Ftoday in the form of the Kenneth fire
OL,9,F- a blaze that has gained rapid
OL,10,Ftraction overnight.
OL,12,FShockingly, it seems to have been
OL,13,Fstarted deliberately. One man has been
OL,14,Farrested.
OL,16,FThis is the problem with the wave of
OL,17,Fwildfires assaulting southern
OL,18,FCalifornia. When one fire is partly
OL,19,Fcontained, another ignites from a
OL,20,Fcombination of the hot wind and dry
OL,21,Fland.

OL,12,FWith wildfires devastating the Los

OL,14,FNews Correspondent Robert Moore speaks
OL,15,Fto mother-of-five Sarah, whose family
OL,16,Fhome was completely destroyed
OL,18,FWe returned to the home of Sarah, a
OL,19,Fmother of five children who escaped
OL,20,Fwith her life - but with no
OL,21,Fpossessions and a deep sense of loss.

OL,7,FBut Sarah also has gratitude. She

OL,9,Fbut her family is intact. She even
OL,10,Fcalls herself blessed.
OL,12,FThat is part of the spirit of these
OL,13,Fsuburbs of Los Angeles. The bond is
OL,14,Fdeep. Everyone is talking about
OL,15,Frebuilding.
OL,17,FThis will be a huge challenge for
OL,18,FAmerica's insurance companies. Can
OL,19,Fthey afford to pay out as much as $20
OL,20,Fbillion? How will it work?

OL,7,FWhat is clear is that multiple

OL,9,Fat the same time: the wildfires, the

OL,13,FThese are likely to be defining days
