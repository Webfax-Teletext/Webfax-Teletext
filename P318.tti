OL,7,FThe world's oldest wine - containing
OL,8,Fsubmerged human remains - has been
OL,9,Fdiscovered at a Roman burial site in
OL,10,FSpain.
OL,12,FThe wine was held inside an urn for
OL,13,F2000 years, along with human bones
OL,14,Fbelonging to a man, in what University
OL,15,Fof Cordoba researchers believe to have
OL,16,Fbeen part of a funeral ritual.
OL,18,FThe tomb was originally discovered in
OL,19,Fthe town of Carmona in southern Spain
OL,20,Fin 2019, and contained the remains of
OL,21,Fsix people in separate urns.
