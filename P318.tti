OL,15,FSpeaking to ITV News, Mr Head
OL,16,Fdescribed the day as a "huge honour
OL,17,Fand privilege", but said it was
OL,18,Fovershadowed by fact that he, like
OL,19,Fmany subpostmasters have not been
OL,20,Fcleared in law - and have not yet
OL,21,Freceived compensation.

OL,10,F"She had a huge amount of empathy for
