OL,8,Fmines on its frontlines, in the same
OL,9,Fway that Russia has.
OL,11,FWhat is different about these mines is
OL,12,Fthey are 'non-persistent' meaning they
OL,13,Fcontain a battery which can be set to
OL,14,Fgo flat up to two weeks after being
OL,15,Flaid, supposedly rendering them safe.
