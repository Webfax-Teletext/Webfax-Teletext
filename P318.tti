OL,5,Cconviction
OL,7,FThe Post Office has been pressed on
OL,8,Fwhy it "does not accept" the
OL,9,Foverturned conviction of a former sub-
OL,10,Fpostmaster three years after they were
OL,11,Fcleared.
OL,13,FEdward Henry KC, who has been
OL,14,Frepresenting Teju Adedayo throughout
OL,15,Fthe Horizon Inquiry, pointed to a
OL,16,Fwritten submission provided by the
OL,17,FPost Office which said it "does not
OL,18,Faccept" that the now-quashed
OL,19,Fconviction of Ms Adedayo from 2005 was
OL,20,F"unsafe".
