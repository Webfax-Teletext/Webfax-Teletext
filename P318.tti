OL,9,FIt's official. The UK has recovered
OL,10,Ffrom a recession that barely got going.
OL,12,FAnd we've emerged at very healthy pace.
OL,14,FThe economy grew by 0.6% in the first

OL,16,Fthat's growth of 2.5% a year - that

OL,18,Fhasn't been for a very long time.

OL,10,F"Today's growth figures are proof that
