OL,4,Cthe Falklands: what you need to know
OL,6,FForeign Secretary David Cameron will
OL,7,Fvisit the Falkland Islands this week.
OL,9,FHere we look at some of the key
OL,10,Fquestions around his visit:
OL,12,F` Why is it significant?
OL,14,FThe last Cabinet minister to visit the
OL,15,FFalkland Islands was then defence
OL,16,Fsecretary Michael Fallon in 2016.
OL,18,FLord Cameron is thought to be the
OL,19,Ffirst foreign secretary to visit the
OL,20,Farchipelago since Douglas Hurd in 1994.

OL,4,Cthe Falklands: what you need to know
OL,6,F` What will he do there?
OL,8,FHe will pay his respects to those who
OL,9,Flost their lives in the 1982 war which
OL,10,Ffollowed Argentina's invasion of the
OL,11,Fislands and he will also visit key
OL,12,Fenvironmental projects.
OL,14,FLord Cameron is also expected to see

OL,16,Fresidents: its penguins.
OL,18,F` Why is he going now?

OL,6,FPart of the reason is that Lord
OL,7,FCameron is heading to South America
OL,8,Ffor a meeting of the G20 foreign
OL,9,Fministers in Brazil.
OL,11,FHe is also honouring a promise made by
OL,12,Fhis predecessor James Cleverly, who
OL,13,Fsaid he would visit the islands.
OL,15,FAhead of his visit, Lord Cameron said
OL,16,Fthe Falklands "are a valued part of
OL,17,Fthe British family" and while the
OL,18,Fislanders want that to continue "the
OL,19,Fissue of sovereignty will not be up

OL,8,Fthe Foreign Office said they "agree to

OL,12,F` So there is no prospect of another

OL,15,FIn 1982 Argentina believed the UK's
OL,16,Fpolitical interest in the Falklands
OL,17,Fwas waning and they would not resist
OL,18,Fthe invasion of the islands, which lie
OL,19,Faround 300 miles from Argentina and
