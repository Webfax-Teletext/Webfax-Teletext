OL,9,FThe toppling of Bashar al-Assad's
OL,10,Fbrutal reign has been a moment of
OL,11,Fcelebration for many Syrians, but for
OL,12,Fthe thousands seeking asylum in the
OL,13,FUK, the future is uncertain.
OL,15,FThe Home Office suspended all asylum
OL,16,Fapplications from Syria earlier this
OL,17,Fweek, following suit with a growing
OL,18,Flist of European countries including
OL,19,FAustria, Germany, and the Republic of

OL,6,FSara Al-Shami, a young journalist from
OL,7,FSyria, was left fearing for her life
OL,8,Fafter being targeted for speaking out
OL,9,Fabout the Assad regime earlier this

OL,12,FShe sought safety in Britain,
OL,13,Fseparated from her family but away
OL,14,Ffrom the brutality. Her name has been
OL,15,Fchanged to protect her identity.
OL,17,F"I was afraid of returning home and
OL,18,Fgetting arrested or being detained by
OL,19,Fthe regime," Sara told ITV News.
