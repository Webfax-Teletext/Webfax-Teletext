OL,7,Fto officially strip Prince Andrew of
OL,8,Fhis titles.
OL,10,FOn Friday, Andrew released a statement
OL,11,Fsaying he would stop using "my title
OL,12,Fand the honours which have been
OL,13,Fconferred upon me".
OL,15,FIt came after renewed controversy

OL,18,Fand fresh scrutiny over his alleged
OL,19,Fcontact with a suspected Chinese spy.
