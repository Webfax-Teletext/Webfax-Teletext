OL,8,FOne of the more frenetic parts of
OL,9,Fevery presidential transition is
OL,10,Fwhat's known as the 'transfer of
OL,11,Ffamilies', where a five-hour sweep
OL,12,Ftransforms the 50,000-square-foot
OL,13,FWhite House for the new occupants.
OL,15,FThe process requires meticulous
OL,16,Forganisation and planning and involves
OL,17,Faround 95 White House staffers, tasked
OL,18,Fwith moving President Biden out of the
OL,19,Fresidence, while simultaneously moving
OL,20,Fthe new President Trump in.
