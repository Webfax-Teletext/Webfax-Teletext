OL,6,FWe just learned that the world's most

OL,10,FHe may not have acknowledged this to

OL,7,Fhours, he came perilously close on
OL,8,FWednesday to having caused such an
OL,9,Fextreme fall in the price of US
OL,10,Fgovernment debt that it would have
OL,11,Fbecome prohibitively expensive for his

OL,15,Fgovernment debt that matures in the
