OL,14,F"There is no place in America for this

OL,6,FSo, by talking to Americans on a
OL,7,FSunday night and appealing for unity,
OL,8,FBiden hoped his long experience - what
OL,9,Fhe likes to call his wisdom - would be
OL,10,Fseen more as a political strength, not
OL,11,Fa liability, amid a national crisis.
OL,13,FBut many Republicans say it's too late
OL,14,Ffor Biden to emerge as a unifying
OL,15,Ffigure. They claim that the president
OL,16,Fhas been demonising Trump for weeks by
OL,17,Flinking him to fascism and suggesting
OL,18,Fhis rival would be a dictator "on day
OL,19,Fone."
