OL,6,FAs the Ayatollah prayed over Haniyeh,

OL,13,FNow it's just a matter of scale, how

OL,6,FA cease-fire deal would first stop the
OL,7,Ffighting in Gaza. Iran and its proxies
OL,8,Fhave waged their own battles on behalf
OL,9,Fof Gaza and a deal would likely halt
OL,10,Ftheir actions.
OL,12,FA deal would also end, or at least
OL,13,Freduce, the continual rockets and
OL,14,Fmissiles being fired across Lebanon's
OL,15,Fsouthern border by Hezbollah.
OL,17,FFinding a path to a deal now would
OL,18,Fallow all those involved to save face
OL,19,Fwhile saving lives not just in Gaza,
OL,20,Fbut across the region.
