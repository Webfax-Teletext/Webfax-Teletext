OL,6,FChris Bulmer, the Met Office's deputy
OL,7,Fchief meteorologist, said that from
OL,8,Fmidweek, Hurricane Kirk, currently in
OL,9,Fthe Atlantic, may continue to bring
OL,10,Fheavy rain and strong wind.
OL,12,FHe said: "Frequent showers, especially
OL,13,Fover southern areas, at first, will
OL,14,Fprobably give way to more widespread
OL,15,Frain and strong winds associated with
OL,16,Fthe remnants of Hurricane Kirk mid to
OL,17,Flate in the week."
