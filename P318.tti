OL,7,Fplanning to use AI to create 30

OL,10,FThe fashion brand said it is working
OL,11,Fwith agencies and models to carry out
OL,12,Fthis initiative in a "responsible way".
OL,14,FThe models would own the rights to

OL,6,FAI is becoming increasingly common and
OL,7,Fmore readily available to the public.
OL,8,FIt's led to several concerns including
OL,9,Fa lack of laws around its use, the
OL,10,Fenvironmental impact, and fears
OL,11,Femployees could lose out on jobs to
OL,12,Fcheaper digital options.
OL,14,FPaul Fleming, general secretary for
OL,15,Factor's union Equity, said he welcomed
OL,16,Fthe promise to pay models for their
OL,17,Flikeness but was concerned these plans
OL,18,Fweren't backed up by appropriate legal
OL,19,Fprotections.

OL,6,F"The race to 'innovate' in the area of
