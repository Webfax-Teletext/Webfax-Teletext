OL,6,FThe deal triggered a 13-year legal
OL,7,Fbattle. In June this year, both Mr
OL,8,FChamberlain and Mr Lynch were cleared
OL,9,Fof charges that they had orchestrated
OL,10,Ffraud and conspiracy ahead of the
OL,11,Fsale, which became a costly burden for
OL,12,FHP.
OL,14,FIf convicted, they could have faced
OL,15,Fmore than 20 years in US prison. Mr
OL,16,FChamberlain had spent 13 months under
OL,17,Fhouse arrest while awaiting the trial
OL,18,Fthat concluded in June.
