OL,6,FMonday's collision between an oil
OL,7,Ftanker and a cargo ship in the North
OL,8,FSea immediately sparked environmental
OL,9,Fconcerns.
OL,11,FThe combination of huge quantities of
OL,12,Fburning jet fuel from the tanker, and
OL,13,Ftoxic chemicals from the cargo ship,
OL,14,Fcould cause major environmental damage.
OL,16,FMarine wildlife and birds could be
OL,17,Fharmed and any damage could also
OL,18,Faffect coastal and fishing communities.

OL,3,CNorth Sea collision: What are the

OL,6,FJet fuels can be less toxic than crude
OL,7,Foil spills, but factors like sea and
OL,8,Fweather conditions are likely to be
OL,9,Fvital.
OL,11,FIt has been confirmed the tanker - the
OL,12,FStena Immaculate - was carrying Jet A-
OL,13,F1 fuel. It's far more flammable than
OL,14,Fdiesel but what about it's impact if
OL,15,Fspilled into the sea?
OL,17,FAccording to the National Oceanic and
OL,18,FAtmospheric Administration, jet fuels
OL,19,Fare "relatively less acutely toxic
OL,20,Fthan diesel."

OL,6,FProfessor Mark Sephton, Professor of

OL,20,F'biodegradation'."
