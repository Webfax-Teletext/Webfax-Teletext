OL,7,FIn a remarkable two-week period,
OL,8,FMinnesota Governor Tim Walz has
OL,9,Fascended from a third-tier candidate
OL,10,Fto Kamala Harris' vice president pick.
OL,12,FThe 60-year-old military veteran has
OL,13,Famassed support from across the
OL,14,FDemocratic Party, progressive and
OL,15,Fmoderate groups, in what has been a
OL,16,Fsophisticated whirlwind campaign.
OL,18,FBut Walz is relatively unknown: An AP-
OL,19,FNORC poll showed that nine in ten US
OL,20,Fadults do not know enough about him to
OL,21,Fform an opinion of the politician.
