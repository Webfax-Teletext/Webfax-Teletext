OL,6,FThese collisions emit light at various
OL,7,Fwavelengths, creating vibrant displays
OL,8,Fof colour in the sky, often appearing
OL,9,Fas curtains, arcs, or bands of light.
OL,11,FThe colours are determined by the type
OL,12,Fof gas particles involved and the
OL,13,Faltitude at which the collisions occur.
OL,15,FGreens appear due to interactions with
OL,16,Foxygen, red is from oxygen in the
