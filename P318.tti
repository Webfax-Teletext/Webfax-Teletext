OL,9,Fsome of the measures they plan to take
OL,10,Fcould be controversial, ITV News Wales
OL,11,FReporter Rhys Williams reports
OL,13,FLatest census data showed a small

OL,15,Fspeakers in Wales from 19% to 17.8%.
OL,17,FBut a big rise in the number of
OL,18,Fchildren speaking Welsh in Cardiff
OL,19,Fmeant the true loss of the language in
OL,20,Fits historical heartlands was masked.

OL,6,FIn areas like Brynamman, at the

OL,9,Fsignificant decline.
OL,11,FIn the 1970s, more than 90% of the

OL,13,F60% do so.
OL,15,FCampaigners say this story is

OL,18,FWales, where English is now becoming
