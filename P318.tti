OL,6,FStress is another issue that can
OL,7,Fimpact our daily lives - but when it
OL,8,Fgets out of control it can really make
OL,9,Fyou sick. Stress releases cortisol,
OL,10,Fwhich when you have too much over a
OL,11,Flong period of time suppresses our
OL,12,Fimmune system, interferes with
OL,13,Fdigestion and can increase our blood
