OL,6,FThe first signs of whooping cough are
OL,7,Fsimilar to those of a cold, such as a
OL,8,Frunny nose and a sore throat.
OL,10,FSymptoms then progress after about a
OL,11,Fweek into coughing bouts lasting a few

OL,16,FThose with the illness may make a
OL,17,F'whoop' sound, caused by gasping for
OL,18,Fbreath between coughs - but this does
