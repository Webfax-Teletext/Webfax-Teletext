OL,6,FWhen Nigel Farage entered this
OL,7,Felection he said it was the start of a
OL,8,Ffive-year mission to reshape the right
OL,9,Fof British politics - either by
OL,10,Fdestroying or merging with the
OL,11,FConservative party.
OL,13,FIn getting four Reform UK MPs elected
OL,14,Fovernight, that mission is on track.
OL,16,FHis parliamentary party may be small,
OL,17,Fbut the four Reform men in the House
OL,18,Fof Commons will be noisy and
OL,19,Fdisruptive.

OL,6,FAt the eighth attempt, Farage is an

OL,11,FAnd - he is arguably the most
OL,12,Finfluential person on the right of
OL,13,FBritish politics today.
OL,15,FReform managed to get more than four
OL,16,Fmillion votes in total with a national
OL,17,Fvote share of just over 14%.

OL,6,FIn the closing days of the campaign,
OL,7,FFarage was talking up the prospect of
OL,8,Fgetting five or six million votes -
OL,9,Fperhaps even eclipsing the
OL,10,FConservative Party's total.
OL,12,FIn terms of votes and vote share - his
OL,13,Fparty hasn't quite hit the heights
OL,14,FFarage had dreamt of.
OL,16,FBut that won't trouble him much.
OL,17,FReform finished in second place in
OL,18,Fdozens and dozens of seats. In the
OL,19,Fnorth of England and Wales, the party
OL,20,Fis clipping at the heels of Labour.

OL,8,FUK got more votes and a bigger vote
