OL,6,FGail's bakery will be dropping its
OL,7,Fsurcharge on soya milk next month
OL,8,Fafter campaigners argued it "unfairly
OL,9,Fdiscriminated" against customers.
OL,11,FThe changes will come into place from
OL,12,FMay 21, but customers who opt for oat
OL,13,Fmilk in their tea or coffee will still
OL,14,Fhave to pay a surcharge of between 40p
OL,15,Fand 60p.
OL,17,FAnimal rights charity Peta, who led
OL,18,Fthe campaign, said it will help
OL,19,Fcustomers make more ethical choices,
OL,20,Fhowever, it called for the oat milk
OL,21,Ffee to also be dropped.
