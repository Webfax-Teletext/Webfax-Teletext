OL,3,CReeves defends move to cut winter fuel
OL,4,Cpayments as 'right decision'
OL,6,FChancellor Rachel Reeves has defended
OL,7,Fthe government's decision to cut
OL,8,Fwinter fuel payments for some
OL,9,Fpensioners, insisting it will be
OL,10,Foffset by increases to pensions and
OL,11,Flower energy prices this winter
OL,12,Fcompared with last year.
OL,14,FReeves said the state pension was
OL,15,Fworth #900 more than in 2023, and that
OL,16,Fit will rise again next April under
OL,17,Fthe triple lock agreement.

OL,4,Cpayments as 'right decision'
OL,6,FMinisters had decided earlier this
OL,7,Fyear to scrap winter fuel payments -
OL,8,Fworth up to #300 per household - for
OL,9,Fthose who do not receive pension
OL,10,Fcredits or other benefits.
OL,12,FSpeaking in the House of Commons, the
OL,13,Fchancellor said she had settled on
OL,14,F"difficult decisions" - which included
OL,15,Fmaking "the winter fuel payment better
OL,16,Ftargeted" - to "put the public
OL,17,Ffinances on a sustainable footing".
