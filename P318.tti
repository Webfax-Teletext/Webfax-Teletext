OL,8,Ffor their first cervical screening -
OL,9,For "smear test" - to help reduce their

OL,12,FThese tests are then repeated every
OL,13,Fthree years, or more frequently,
OL,14,Fdepending on what test results show.
OL,16,FOn Tuesday, the NHS announced a major

OL,18,Fprogramme, changing how often women
OL,19,Fwho test negative for the virus

OL,21,Fare called back to be tested again.

OL,11,FWhat is cervical screening?
OL,13,FThe opening from the womb to the
