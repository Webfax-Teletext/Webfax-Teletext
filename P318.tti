OL,7,FSir Ed Davey has apologised for taking
OL,8,Ffive months to meet with ex-sub-
OL,9,Fpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, who wanted
OL,10,Fto share his concerns about the Post
OL,11,FOffice's faulty IT system.
OL,13,FThe Liberal Democrat leader gave
OL,14,Fevidence at Thursday's inquiry, also
OL,15,Fclaiming he was "misled" by the Post
OL,16,FOffice during his time as postal
OL,17,Faffairs minister between 2010 and 2012.
OL,19,FThe audience groaned as he said he did
OL,20,Fnot remember reading Bates' first
OL,21,Fletter requesting a meeting.
