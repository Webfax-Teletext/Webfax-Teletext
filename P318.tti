OL,7,FSir Lindsay Hoyle has been re-elected

OL,12,FIt is all change in Westminster this

OL,14,Fthe first time - the largest number of

OL,17,FBut despite a new government and new

OL,7,FOn Tuesday, as Sir Lindsay Hoyle was
OL,8,Fre-elected as Speaker, he was
OL,9,Fphysically dragged into position as
OL,10,Fpart of a centuries-old tradition.
OL,12,FBut why does this happen? ITV News
OL,13,FExplains.
OL,15,FWhen did the tradition start?
OL,17,FThe exact origins of the tradition are
OL,18,Fnot known, but it has been a part of
OL,19,Fthe ceremonial proceedings surrounding
OL,20,Fthe election for several centuries.

OL,3,CWhy is the newly elected Speaker of
OL,4,Cthe House of Commons dragged into
OL,5,Cposition?
OL,7,FHow did the dragging start?
OL,9,FIt has its roots in the original
OL,10,Ffunction of the Speaker which was to
OL,11,Fcommunicate the Commons' opinions to
OL,12,Fthe monarch.
OL,14,FHistorically, if the monarch didn't
OL,15,Fagree with the message being
OL,16,Fcommunicated then they could order the
OL,17,Fdeath of the Speaker.
OL,19,FTherefore previous Speakers required
OL,20,Fsome persuasion to accept the post.

OL,7,FWhy does it still happen?
OL,9,FThe custom continues to this day as a

OL,11,Fimportant part of the formalities that
OL,12,Faccompany the appointment of a new
OL,13,FSpeaker.
