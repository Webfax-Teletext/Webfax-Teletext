OL,3,CWhat is a shallow earthquake and why
OL,4,Care they so dangerous?
OL,6,FA shallow earthquake is when the
OL,7,Fseismic event happens close to the
OL,8,Fsurface of the Earth, between 0km and
OL,9,F70km. For context, a deep earthquake
OL,10,Fis 300 - 700 km.
OL,12,FShallow earthquakes are more dangerous
OL,13,Fbecause there is less distance for the
OL,14,Fwaves to travel before striking cities
OL,15,Fand infrastructure head-on.
OL,17,FThe deeper the earthquake, the more
OL,18,Fenergy the waves use and the less
OL,19,Fimpact they have when they hit the
OL,20,Fsurface.
