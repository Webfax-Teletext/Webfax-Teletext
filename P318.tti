OL,6,FWhat is the Mental Capacity Act?
OL,8,FThe Mental Capacity Act was introduced
OL,9,Fin 2005 in a bid to minimise the
OL,10,Fnumber of vulnerable adults being

OL,12,Findefinitely, and to give them more
OL,13,Fautonomy over their own care.
OL,15,FIt states that as a starting point
OL,16,Feveryone should be presumed to have
OL,17,Fthe capacity to make their own
OL,18,Fdecisions about their own safety and
OL,19,Fwellbeing, and that assessment should
OL,20,Fbe carried out if their capacity is in
OL,21,Fdoubt.
