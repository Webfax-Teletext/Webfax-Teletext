OL,7,FThe trio were taken from the convent
OL,8,Ftwo years ago on the grounds they
OL,9,Fcould not live independently and
OL,10,Frelocated to a retirement home in the
OL,11,Fnearby town, Oberalm.
OL,13,FBut the nuns claimed they were taken
OL,14,Fagainst their will and insist they are
OL,15,Fcapable of caring for themselves.
OL,17,FEarlier this month, the nuns returned
OL,18,Fto their old convent with the help of
OL,19,Fsome former students and a locksmith.

OL,7,F"It's not a break-in," Sister

OL,10,F"The basis for this is our contract of

OL,14,F"And we are now exercising that right
