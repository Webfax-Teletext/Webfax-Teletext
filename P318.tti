OL,6,FThe Makin Review into one of the
OL,7,FChurch of England's most prolific
OL,8,Fabusers uncovered a series of
OL,9,Fsafeguarding failings - and led to the
OL,10,FArchbishop of Canterbury's resignation.
OL,12,FThe review looked at how the Church
OL,13,Fhandled allegations that barrister
OL,14,FJohn Smyth QC, who died in 2018, had
OL,15,Fabused more than 100 children and
OL,16,Fyoung men in the UK and Africa over
OL,17,Ffive decades.
OL,19,FHe died in 2018, aged 75, and was
