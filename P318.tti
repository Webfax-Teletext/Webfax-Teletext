OL,6,FLast week, a whistleblower came
OL,7,Fforward alleging parts of Boeing's 787
OL,8,FDreamliner planes were built in an
OL,9,Funsafe manner ` potentially leading to
OL,10,F"devastating consequences". A previous
OL,11,Fwhistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing
OL,12,Fengineer, said he found and reported

OL,15,FFor nearly two years starting in 2021,
OL,16,Fthe FAA and Boeing halted deliveries
OL,17,Fof the new Dreamliners while it looked
OL,18,Finto the gaps. Boeing said it made
OL,19,Fchanges in its manufacturing process
OL,20,Fand deliveries ultimately resumed.
