OL,6,G1974 The world's first teletext
OL,7,Gservice - Ceefax - is formally
OL,8,Glaunched by the BBC. Test
OL,9,Gtransmissions had already been taking
OL,10,Gplace since 1972. Soon after the BBC
OL,11,Ghad developed Ceefax, the IBA created
OL,12,Ga similar, though incompatible system
OL,13,Gcalled ORACLE. In 1976, The BBC and

OL,25,Gnew system - MHEG-5.JHowever, the
OL,26,Gfamiliar 1970s system continued on
