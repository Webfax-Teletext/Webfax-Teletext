OL,4,CTELETEXT
OL,6,G1974 The world's first teletext
OL,7,Gservice - Ceefax - is formally
OL,8,Glaunched by the BBC. Test
OL,9,Gtransmissions had already been taking
OL,10,Gplace since 1972. Soon after the BBC
OL,11,Ghad developed Ceefax, the IBA created
OL,12,Ga similar, though incompatible system
OL,13,Gcalled ORACLE. In 1976, The BBC and
OL,14,GIBA agreed a new standard, known as
OL,15,GWorld System Teletext.JAlthough sales
OL,16,Gof suitably equipped TV sets were slow
OL,17,Gin the early years, teletext would
OL,18,Gbecome a familiar sight in many
OL,19,Ghouseholds by the late-1980s. Although
OL,20,Gthe original teletext format was
OL,21,Ginitially carried on the digital
OL,22,Gversions of the main BBC channels, it
OL,23,Gwas discontinued on digital platforms
OL,24,Gin the early 2000s, and replaced by a
OL,25,Gnew system - MHEG-5.JHowever, the
OL,26,Gfamiliar 1970s system continued on
