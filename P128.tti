OL,6,G1974 The world's first teletext
OL,7,Gservice - Ceefax - is formally
OL,8,Glaunched by the BBC. Test
OL,9,Gtransmissions had already been taking

OL,11,Gdeveloped Ceefax, the IBA created a
OL,12,Gsimilar, though incompatible system
OL,13,Gcalled ORACLE. In 1976, The BBC and
OL,14,GIBA agreed a new standard, known as
