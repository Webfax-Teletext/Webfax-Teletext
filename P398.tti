OL,6,FDevelopments in Manchester's Stevenson
OL,7,FSquare have been criticised by
OL,8,Fdisability activists.
OL,10,FThe plans were for an area that was
OL,11,Fpartly pedestrianised, with outdoor
OL,12,Fseating and cycle lanes. Manchester
OL,13,FCity Council described it as "a safe
OL,14,Fspace to move through."
OL,16,FDave Steele has tunnel vision and has
OL,17,Fbeen losing his sight for the last ten
OL,18,Fyears and has found concrete blocks
OL,19,Fplaced around the area as inaccessible.

OL,6,F"These have been placed to make the
OL,7,Fplace look pretty or places for people
OL,8,Fto sit, but they are the perfect
OL,9,Fheight for anyone, not just people
OL,10,Flike me with a visual impairment to
OL,11,Fhit their shins on," said Mr Steele.
OL,13,F"Unless my cane hits that, which I'm
OL,14,Fhoping it's going to, I'm maybe going
OL,15,Fto trip over them and they are dotted
OL,16,Feverywhere."
OL,18,FAnother concern for visually impaired
OL,19,Fpeople is the lack of indicators to
OL,20,Fhelp when crossing the road.

OL,6,F"Normally I'd be looking for a

OL,8,Fthere," continued Mr Steele.
OL,10,F"If someone's trying to get across
OL,11,Fwith a wheelchair, or who's got
OL,12,Fmobility issues, they'd be struggling
OL,13,Fto get across in time. There's no

OL,18,FCampaigners are asking for those with
