OL,6,FDenise said she travelled to the

OL,6,F"She was amazing, when it came to her

OL,10,FGood Morning Britain (GMB).
OL,12,F"If she was having a bad day, she
OL,13,Fcalled it a duvet day, and she'd go to
OL,14,Fbed and stay in bed all day if she was
OL,15,Fhaving a bad day.
OL,17,F"She never let me see that side of
OL,18,Fher, as I said. If she wasn't feeling
OL,19,Fwell, she would go up to her room and
OL,20,Fthat was it. But most of the time she
OL,21,Fwas joking and laughing."

OL,6,FDenise added: "It was very sudden

OL,8,Fgot her in the end, she could have
OL,9,Flived another few years but she got
OL,10,Fpneumonia and her immune system was so
OL,11,Fbad she couldn't handle it, but I say
OL,12,Fto anyone with cancer you can still
OL,13,Fget on with it if you have Linda's
