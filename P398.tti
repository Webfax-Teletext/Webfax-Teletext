OL,6,FThe parents of 19-year-old Matthew
OL,7,FLock say their son was an "incredible
OL,8,Findividual" who "wanted to make a
OL,9,Fchange", but he struggled with the
OL,10,Fsymptoms of his diagnosis before his
OL,11,Fdeath in 2023.
OL,13,FThey say Matthew, who appeared on
OL,14,FITV's This Morning as a technology
OL,15,Freviewer, used alcohol and ketamine to
OL,16,Ftry to ease his ADHD symptoms because
OL,17,Fmedication did not agree with him.
