OL,9,Fdidn't really hear any noise. I froze.
OL,10,FI didn't know what to do and as it got

OL,6,FPeter David McHugh was in his fifth
OL,7,Ffloor apartment at Royal Mills, on the
OL,8,Fother side of the dust devil, when he
OL,9,Fnoticed suddenly it got very dark in
OL,10,Fhis flat.
OL,12,FHe said: "I was inside and it was

OL,15,Fthere's there's this towering cloud of

OL,6,F"Unlike tornadoes, dust devils grow

OL,10,Fat the top of the rising column of
