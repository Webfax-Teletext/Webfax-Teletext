OL,6,FVoters in Rochdale are being faced
OL,7,Fwith the bizarre prospect of a by-
OL,8,Felection in which they cannot back
OL,9,Fanybody from Labour - while three
OL,10,Fformer candidates sit on the ballot.
OL,12,FThe party withdrew its support for
OL,13,Fcandidate Azhar Ali after offensive
