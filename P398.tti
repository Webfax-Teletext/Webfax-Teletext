OL,6,Fpermanent pain after a crash, has
OL,7,Freleased photographs of her injuries
OL,8,Fin the hope it encourages car and van
OL,9,Fdrivers to be mindful of more
OL,10,Fvulnerable road users.
OL,12,FElaine Velho was a passenger on a
OL,13,Fmotorbike riding past the Royal Oak on
OL,14,FHigh Street, Bromborough, in Summer
OL,15,F2022, when she was hit by a car coming
OL,16,Fout of a side road.
OL,18,FShe was flung onto the road along with
OL,19,Fthe rider, leaving them both battered,
OL,20,Fbruised and in need of hospital
OL,21,Ftreatment.

OL,7,Fcampaigns on behalf of bikers across
OL,8,Fthe UK, said the incident left her

OL,10,Fof side roads. She was forced to take
OL,11,Fa break from the roads, and traded in
OL,12,Fher high-powered motorbike for a
OL,13,Fsmaller, less powerful version.
