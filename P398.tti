OL,6,FAvanti West Coast has been told to "do
OL,7,Fbetter" by the rail minister after
OL,8,Fcriticism by politicians, passengers
OL,9,Fand business leaders for its 'poor
OL,10,Fperformance'.
OL,12,FThe latest call for improvements comes
OL,13,Famid warnings HS2 cutbacks could
OL,14,F"badly hit" Manchester services.
OL,16,FCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who
OL,17,Frepresents Chorley, criticised the
OL,18,F"appalling service" on the West Coast
OL,19,FMain Line.
