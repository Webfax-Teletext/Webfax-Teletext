OL,6,FOn Wednesday 13 November, the Criminal
OL,7,FCases Review Commission (CCRC) said
OL,8,Fthat Sullivan's conviction had been
OL,9,Freferred to the Court of Appeal on the
OL,10,Fbasis of DNA evidence.
OL,12,FSamples taken at the time of the

OL,18,Fhis case re-examined in 2021, raising
OL,19,Fconcerns about police interviews, bite
OL,20,Fmark evidence and the murder weapon.
