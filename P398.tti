OL,6,FThe politician behind the Isle of
OL,7,FMan's Assisted Dying Bill has
OL,8,Frequested a meeting in Westminster
OL,9,Fover the "apparent delay" to the
OL,10,Flegislation being given royal assent.
OL,12,FAlex Allinson said there has been
OL,13,F"concern expressed" by local
OL,14,Fparliament members and the wider
OL,15,Fcommunity about the hold up of nearly
OL,16,Fa year.
OL,18,FThe Isle of Man Tynwald passed the
OL,19,Fassisted dying legislation in March
OL,20,F2025 - the first parliament in the
OL,21,FBritish Isles to do so.

OL,11,Fhas to make a recommendation.
OL,13,FIn a letter to Mr Lammy, Mr Allinson
