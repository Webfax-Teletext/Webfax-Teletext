OL,5,FSCISAFE campaigned heavily for the
OL,6,Fintroduction of smoke hoods which
OL,7,Fwould allow passengers to breathe in
OL,8,Fthe event of a fire.
OL,10,FBut the CAA argued that finding, and
OL,11,Fputting on a smoke hood, would delay
OL,12,Fpassengers leaving the plane rather
OL,13,Fthan help them and the recommendation
OL,14,Fwas never implemented.
OL,16,FDavid Beardmore, who was 13 at the
OL,17,Ftime of the incident and managed to
OL,18,Fget off the plane , says he believes
OL,19,Fthey should be mandatory.

OL,3,CWhat was the Manchester Air Disaster?
OL,5,F"The recommendation from Manchester
OL,6,Fwas that the CAA was to build a set of
OL,7,Frecommendations for a specification
OL,8,Ffor smoke hoods, and they did, they
OL,9,Fbuilt a very, very good specification,
OL,10,Fone which no one could, in 1985 and a
OL,11,Ffew years later, actually achieve,
OL,12,Ftherefore they didn't put smoke hoods
OL,13,Fon aircraft, even though they are
OL,14,Fthere for crew.
OL,16,F"For passengers, the CAA always
OL,17,Fbelieved that onboard fires, and the
OL,18,Fsituation at Manchester, was so
OL,19,Funlikely that they still claim having
OL,20,Flife vests under seats was a priority.
