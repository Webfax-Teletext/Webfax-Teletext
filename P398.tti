OL,6,FThe fire turned out to be minor, but
OL,7,Fthe scare has sparked a powerful
OL,8,Fcampaign. The teenager is now calling
OL,9,Ffor evacuation chairs to be made a

OL,12,FEvacuation chairs are specially
OL,13,Fdesigned to be used by people with

OL,15,Fduring emergencies such as a fire when

OL,18,FThere is currently no legal

OL,20,Fevacuation chairs installed; something
OL,21,FLucas is hoping to change.
