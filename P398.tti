OL,7,Fexpenses rules by using taxpayer-
OL,8,Ffunded resources to produce "overtly
OL,9,Fpolitical" material for the Tories, a
OL,10,Fwatchdog has found.
OL,12,FThe Independent Parliamentary
OL,13,FStandards Authority (IPSA) said the MP
OL,14,Fshould repay #1,367 after he used a
OL,15,Fstate-of-the-art printer for

OL,18,FIt also found he had under-reported
OL,19,Fthe use of his Blackpool North and

OL,21,Flocal Conservative Party association.
