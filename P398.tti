OL,11,FAt her inquest, the Kimberley's death

OL,6,FThe inquest into Kimberley's death
OL,7,Fheard she had taken ecstasy with a man
OL,8,Fshe had considered to be a friend -
OL,9,FRyan Sheridan - before they went to

OL,12,FDespite Kimberley's unresponsive state
OL,13,F- Sheridan waited 24 hours to contact
OL,14,Fanyone, and even then it was his
OL,15,Fmother he called, not an ambulance.
OL,17,FThe court heard Sheridan's mother then
OL,18,Fcalled 999, 30 hours after Kimberley
OL,19,Fhad died, but only after buying
OL,20,Fsandwiches for her son.
