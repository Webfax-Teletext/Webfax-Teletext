OL,6,FITV Granada Reports correspondent
OL,7,FElaine Willcox paid a visit to
OL,8,FStephen's home to see how the cramped

OL,13,Ftimes a day says it is impossible to
OL,14,Fgive "his children a better life"
OL,15,Funtil they find a suitable home.
OL,17,FStephen Murray currently lives with
OL,18,Fhis four sons in his one bedroom flat
