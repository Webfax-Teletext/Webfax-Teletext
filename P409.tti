OL,6,FPolice said the hearing found the

OL,10,FChief Superintendent Sean Wilson said:
OL,11,F"Pc Gatt's actions towards this young

OL,13,Fcertainly not what we would expect

OL,17,F"No police officer should use force

OL,20,Fstill been a serving police officer,
OL,21,Fhe would have been dismissed."
