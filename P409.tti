OL,6,FThe Mayor of London has praised new
OL,7,Fpolice technology which helps to
OL,8,Fvisualise bruising in darker skin,
OL,9,Funveiled as part of efforts to tackle
OL,10,Fviolence against women and girls.
OL,12,FSir Sadiq Khan said the device
OL,13,Fdeveloped by the Metropolitan Police
OL,14,Fwas an example of "how much the police
OL,15,Fhas changed in the last few years".
OL,17,FThe devices, known as Project Archway,
OL,18,Fallow officers to better assess
OL,19,Fvictims' injuries, particularly on
OL,20,Fdarker skin, by making it easier to
OL,21,Fphotograph and visualise bruising.
