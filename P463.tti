OL,8,Freaders may find distressing.
OL,10,FEthan Ives-Griffiths was let down by
OL,11,Fthe very people who should have
OL,12,Fprotected him and who should have kept
OL,13,Fhim safe - his grandparents, Michael
OL,14,Fand Kerry Ives, and his mother,
OL,15,FShannon. This was a toddler who, the

OL,17,Fbeen "targeted" in the last weeks of
OL,18,Fhis life.
