OL,6,FThe first minister, Vaughan Gething,
OL,7,Fhas lost a Senedd vote of no
OL,8,Fconfidence today (Wednesday, 5 June),
OL,9,Fbut says he will not resign.
OL,11,FIt comes after members of the Senedd
OL,12,Fcast their votes on whether they have
OL,13,Fconfidence in Mr Gething's ability as
OL,14,Fa leader.
OL,16,FMembers of the Senedd voted with 29 in
OL,17,Ffavour and 27 against. The motion
OL,18,Ftherefore passes.
OL,20,FThe result is not binding and does not
OL,21,Fcompel the first minister to resign.

OL,12,FWhen asked whether or not he would
