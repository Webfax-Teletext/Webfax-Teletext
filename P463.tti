OL,6,F"Before I could get up properly to go
OL,7,Fsee what it was, the phone rang," said
OL,8,FJeanette.
OL,10,FIt was her son, asking if they were
OL,11,Fokay because there had been a plane
OL,12,Fcrash nearby.
OL,14,FJeanette said she then went outside
OL,15,Fand asked a lady walking down the
OL,16,Fstreet if a plane had crashed in the
OL,17,Fstreet.
OL,19,F"Yes!" said the lady. "It's in your
OL,20,Fback garden!"

OL,12,F"There it was in all its glory, all

OL,18,Fnot any closer to their house.
