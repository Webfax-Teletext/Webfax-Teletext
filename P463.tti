OL,10,FThe idea came to the Revd Gillibrand
OL,11,Fwhen he began thinking about the
OL,12,Fchallenges people in the local
OL,13,Fcommunity were facing after Covid.
OL,15,FHe said: "One of the things that is
OL,16,Fmost striking to me as the parish
OL,17,Fpriest is how much pressure
OL,18,Findividuals and families are under,
OL,19,Fand so that's why we came up with this
OL,20,Fidea of a short church service.

OL,11,FHe added that the services aren't

OL,14,Fbeing in the church otherwise" within

OL,10,FHe said: "Churches always need to be
