OL,9,Fnever mind what century you're in and
OL,10,Fthey're strong emotions, and I felt
OL,11,Fthey could express more than what I
OL,12,Fcould express through my own songs.
OL,14,F"I myself am in recovery from
OL,15,Faddiction and mental health issues and
OL,16,FI believe that we all are, to some

OL,18,Ffelt these hymns that had a lot to
OL,19,Foffer a society that is addicted."
