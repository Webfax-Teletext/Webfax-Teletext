OL,6,FThe closure of a cultural centre in
OL,7,Fhas been met with opposition from
OL,8,Flocals who fear the impact it will
OL,9,Fhave on the community and have
OL,10,Fcriticised the way in which the
OL,11,Fclosure has happened.
OL,13,FRedhouse Cymru has been a town hall, a
OL,14,Fcouncil chambers and a magistrates
OL,15,Fcourt over the last hundred years,
OL,16,Fbefore an #8 million redevelopment
OL,17,Fwith European money turned it into an
OL,18,Farts centre.
OL,20,FBut over the weekend the venue was
OL,21,Fshut down due to contract complexities.
