OL,14,F"It eventually came out and started

OL,17,F"We couldn't believe it."

OL,6,FCurled octopus, also known as lesser
OL,7,Foctopus, can be found in the UK as
OL,8,Fwell as European beaches.
OL,10,FThey live in shallow waters and feed
OL,11,Fon other marine creatures such as
OL,12,Ffish, crabs, shrimp, clams and mussels.
OL,14,FOn occasion, these creatures will use

OL,18,FThe curled octopus is very elusive and

OL,6,FHowever, the species is thought to be
