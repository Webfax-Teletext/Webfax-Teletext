OL,7,FIn his evidence to the UK Covid

OL,9,Fbased on three areas of concern.
OL,10,FFirstly, he said he was concerned

OL,13,Fcare staff had access to face

OL,7,FSecondly, he thought wearing of face
OL,8,Fcoverings would promote "risky

OL,10,Fwas that the face coverings being used
OL,11,Fgenerally in the UK did not meet World

OL,13,Ftherefore would have little material
