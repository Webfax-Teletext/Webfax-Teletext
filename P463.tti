OL,13,FAndrew RT Davies had said that his

OL,12,FThe Senedd's standards commissioner
OL,13,FDouglas Bain said that as: "Leader of

OL,6,FThe cross-party standards committee

OL,9,Fthree of the code of conduct - members

OL,6,FIn a response, Mr Davies said: The

OL,8,Fconsidered usage of the term "blanket"
OL,9,Fto describe the new 20mph speed limit
OL,10,Fin Wales. The Committee agreed that,
OL,11,Fwhen using the term, I was expressing
OL,12,Fa value judgment and not a statement

OL,15,FCommittee believed that this
