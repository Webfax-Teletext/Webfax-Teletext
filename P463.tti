OL,6,FWarren Gatland says Wales' opener was
OL,7,F"one of the worst" halves of rugby in
OL,8,Fhis coaching career.
OL,10,F"It's probably one of the worst 40-
OL,11,Fminute performances in my whole rugby
OL,12,Fcareer as a coach," he told S4C.
OL,14,FWales lost to Scotland at the
OL,15,FPrincipality Stadium for the first

OL,6,F"We're really disappointed with the

OL,8,Fweren't accurate enough." he said.
OL,10,FBut Wales almost managed to turn it
OL,11,Faround, falling short of a historic
OL,12,Fcomeback to end the match 26-27.
OL,14,FGatland said his message to the

OL,16,Fgo out there and play some rugby."
OL,18,FIt wasn't all bad though, he said the

OL,20,Ffighting" in the second half.
