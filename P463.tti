OL,12,FJames Howells took legal action

OL,6,FDismissing the case on Thursday, Judge
OL,7,FAndrew Keyser KC at the High Court
OL,8,Fsaid Mr Howells does not have "any
OL,9,Freasonable grounds" to bring the claim
OL,10,Fand it "would have no realistic
OL,11,Fprospect of succeeding if it went to
OL,12,Ftrial".
OL,14,FMr Howells previously told the High
OL,15,FCourt in Cardiff he had mined 8,000
OL,16,FBitcoin in 2009 and secured it with a
OL,17,Fprivate key that was stored on a hard
OL,18,Fdrive which he kept in a drawer in his
OL,19,Fhome.

OL,7,Fout of his house, he put the hard

OL,9,Fwas a different, empty hard drive,
OL,10,Fwhich his partner then threw away.
OL,12,FHe said he was prompted to check on

OL,6,FNewport City Council rejected the
OL,7,Fexcavation plan, arguing that it would
OL,8,Frisk harming people and the
OL,9,Fenvironment and would be in breach of
OL,10,Fits licence with the Welsh

OL,13,Fthat because the hard drive had been
OL,14,Fdisposed of, Mr Howells had forfeited
OL,15,Fhis ownership of it.
OL,17,FJudge Keyser ruled that too much time
