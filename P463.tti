OL,3,CWhat do young voters in Wales make of
OL,4,Cproposed National Service?
OL,6,FWith nearly a month to go until the
OL,7,FGeneral Election, many voters may
OL,8,Fstill be deciding which candidate to
OL,9,Fchoose.
OL,11,FSome of those people may be voting for
OL,12,Fthe first time, and all parties will
OL,13,Fbe vying for their vote.
OL,15,FThe Conservatives have pledged to
OL,16,Fintroduce a new National Service for
OL,17,F18-year-olds, where they will either
OL,18,Ftrain in the military for a year, or
OL,19,Fdo a form of community service in
OL,20,Forganisations like the NHS or fire
OL,21,Fservice.

OL,6,FThose who refuse to participate could
OL,7,Fbe subject to "some form of sanction".
OL,9,FThe party said this would create
OL,10,Fopportunities for young people and
OL,11,Fgive them "real world skills".
OL,13,FBut Labour have called the policy a
OL,14,Fgimmick, and Plaid Cymru have called
OL,15,Fit "an attack on the young".
OL,17,FSo what do young people in Wales think
OL,18,Fof the pledge? At one film group in
OL,19,FRhyl, they weren't keen.

OL,6,FDylan Owen, 21, said "I think it's
OL,7,Ftaking away all the opportunities from
OL,8,Fyoung people to get out there and do
OL,9,Ftheir hobbies, because if you're
OL,10,Fmaking them go into the army then
OL,11,Fthey're not getting that opportunity
OL,12,Fto perform.
OL,14,F"They're forcing them in a way."
OL,16,F15-year-old Amy Virgo also disliked
OL,17,Fthe policy, saying "it's the wrong way
OL,18,Fto go about it, because if you want to
OL,19,Fdo it you can, but you don't need to
