OL,6,FAfter storming the beaches on D-Day,
OL,7,Fthe Allies' next challenge was
OL,8,Fsupplying reinforcements and equipment
OL,9,Ffor their advance into occupied Europe.
OL,11,FTo do this, they constructed vast
OL,12,Fartificial ports known as 'Mulberry
OL,13,Fharbours' and Richard Pelzer, from
OL,14,FSwansea, helped build them.
OL,16,FMr Pelzer, now 100 years old, served

OL,7,Fdeadly for one of his comrades,
OL,8,FCorporal Wray.
OL,10,FRichard said, "We dug up this

OL,12,Fpulling a Tellermine went off. Next
OL,13,Fthing I knew he was sprawling by the

OL,17,Fstage was to install the Mulberry

OL,6,FRichard and his comrades had spend
OL,7,Fmany weeks before the invasion
OL,8,Fsecretly building the harbours in
OL,9,FScotland.
OL,11,FBut the next mammoth task saw hundreds
OL,12,Fof the prefabricated structures
OL,13,Fbrought across the Channel. The
OL,14,Fresulting ports, assembled in just 12
OL,15,Fdays by thousands of engineers,
OL,16,Ffeatured 6 miles of steel roadways.
OL,18,FIt was a pleasing moment, Richard
OL,19,Fsaid: "To say I was there when the
OL,20,Fkeel of that thing went down to the
OL,21,Fcompletion - I was a very lucky chap."

OL,7,Fbecame known as Port Winston, allowing

OL,10,FIt was an engineering feat which sped
OL,11,Fup the end of the war.
OL,13,F"It was still operating in November of

OL,15,Foperating. The people who built the
