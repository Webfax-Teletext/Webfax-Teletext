OL,3,C'Our baby was born with one eye and

OL,6,FSoon after his birth, doctors gave
OL,7,FVinnie a diagnosis of a rare condition
OL,8,Fcalled the Goldenhar Syndrome, which
OL,9,Fis said to affect one in every 3,000-
OL,10,F5,000 births, with the majority of
OL,11,Fthem being boys.
OL,13,FMum Grace said it was "a complete
OL,14,Fshock."
OL,16,FGrace said: "Vinnie's only one out of
OL,17,Ftwo in the whole world that was born
OL,18,Fwith Goldenhar syndrome without the
OL,19,Feye ` it's not normal to not have an
OL,20,Feye with the condition."

OL,6,FJust three months old, Vinnie has been
OL,7,Fconstantly undergoing procedures and
OL,8,Fscans since he was born.
OL,10,FHe was also found to have sleep
OL,11,Fapnoea, leading to tracheostomy. This
OL,12,Fmeans that he breathes through a tube
OL,13,Fthat's been fitted in his neck, and is
OL,14,Ffed through a nasogastric tube.
OL,16,FGrace added that it was hard to see
OL,17,Fher son go through so much at such a
OL,18,Fyoung age.

OL,14,FVinnie has to go to Great Ormond
