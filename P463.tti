OL,6,FIn a report published on Tuesday (22
OL,7,FOctober), the committee urged the
OL,8,FWelsh Government to ease the pressure
OL,9,Fon tenants facing a no-fault eviction
OL,10,Fby looking into a proposal where
OL,11,Flandlords would give renters the last
OL,12,Ftwo months' rent of their tenancy as
OL,13,Fcompensation.
OL,15,FSingle-parent of two Jeffrey Walters,
OL,16,Ffrom Newport, was served a no-fault
OL,17,Feviction notice by his landlord in
OL,18,FSeptember 2022. He says he encountered
OL,19,Fproblems when he tried to let
OL,20,Fsomewhere.

OL,12,Fadded that he feels tenants of no-

OL,16,FThe Welsh Government told the
