OL,4,Cnew First Minister in Wales?
OL,6,FOnce Welsh Labour has elected a new
OL,7,Fleader on Saturday, attention turns to
OL,8,Fthe Senedd for subsequent events.JMark
OL,9,FDrakeford will no longer be leader of
OL,10,FWelsh Labour but he will remain First
OL,11,FMinister for a further few days.JOn
OL,12,FTuesday 19 March, he will take his
OL,13,Flast First Minister's Questions which
OL,14,Fbegins at 1.30pm.JSoon after finishing
OL,15,Fthat session, he will tender his
OL,16,Fresignation to the King and once that
OL,17,Fhappens, the Senedd has 28 days to
OL,18,Fnominate another member of the Welsh
OL,19,FParliament to become First Minister.
OL,20,FIn fact, that should take place the
OL,21,Fnext day: Wednesday 20th March.

OL,6,FUnder the Senedd's standing orders,
OL,7,Fthe Llywydd or Presiding Officer, Elin
OL,8,FJones, must invite nominations. If
OL,9,Fthere's only one nomination, then she
OL,10,Fdeclares that person to be the
OL,11,FSenedd's nominee for the post of First
OL,12,FMinister.JIf there's more than one
OL,13,Fnomination - in other words, if the
OL,14,FWelsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru
OL,15,Fnominate their leaders - then there
OL,16,Fhas to be a kind of vote, a roll call.
OL,17,FThe Llywydd will call each member in
OL,18,Falphabetical order to vote for a
OL,19,Fcandidate. She and the Deputy
OL,20,FPresiding Officer, Labour's David Rees
OL,21,Fare excluded from this vote.

OL,3,CWhat happens next in the election of a
OL,4,Cnew First Minister in Wales?
OL,6,FIf two members are nominated, the
OL,7,Fcandidate with the most votes becomes
OL,8,Fthe nominee. If they have the same
OL,9,Fnumber of votes, there has to be
OL,10,Fanother roll call.JThis is exactly
OL,11,Fwhat happened in 2016 when members of
OL,12,FPlaid Cymru, the Conservatives and
OL,13,FUKIP voted for Leanne Wood to become
OL,14,FFirst Minister instead of Carwyn
OL,15,FJones.JBetween them they had 29 votes
OL,16,Fas did Labour with the support of the
OL,17,FLiberal Democrat Kirsty Williams.
OL,18,FTalks were held and another vote the
OL,19,Ffollowing week led to Carwyn Jones
OL,20,Fresuming the post of First Minister.
OL,21,FThis time around, even if the
OL,22,Fopposition parties were to unite they
OL,23,Fcan't block Labour's nomination
OL,24,Fbecause one of their members, Rhys ab
OL,25,FOwen, has been suspended from the
OL,26,FSenedd, so Labour can muster 29 votes

OL,6,FIn this event, a simple majority of
OL,7,FLabour votes will mean that the Labour
OL,8,Fleader wins. In the highly unlikely
OL,9,Fscenario of them not winning a
OL,10,Fmajority, the candidate with the least
OL,11,Fvotes is eliminated and another roll
OL,12,Fcall held.JOnce all this is over, the
OL,13,FLlywdd sends a letter to the King (by
OL,14,Ffax!) telling him the name of the
OL,15,FSenedd's nominee to become First
OL,16,FMinister.JThe King then appoints that
OL,17,Fperson First Minister by Royal Warrant
OL,18,Fand when that has been granted the new
OL,19,FFirst Minister will swear his oath to
OL,20,Fthe monarch in a ceremony in Cardiff.
OL,21,FAfter that happens, the new First
OL,22,FMinister will begin assembling his
OL,23,Fcabinet before taking his first
OL,24,FQuestion session in the Senedd on the
OL,25,F16th April following the Easter recess.
