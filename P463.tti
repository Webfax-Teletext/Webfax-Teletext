OL,3,CDog rescue warns of increase of
OL,4,C'pandemic puppies' coming into their
OL,5,Ccare
OL,7,FThey say the increase is down to a
OL,8,Frise in dog ownership during the
OL,9,Fpandemic, when many puppies born
OL,10,Fduring this time weren't neutered, and
OL,11,Fare now having puppies themselves.
OL,13,FThey say 97% of adult dogs arriving as
OL,14,Fstrays or relinquished from owners at
OL,15,FHope Rescue during the last three
OL,16,Fmonths are unneutered.
OL,18,FThey say a litter of four puppies,
OL,19,Fonly one-week-old, arrived in their
OL,20,Fcare this week, having been abandoned
OL,21,Fin a horse yard in Merthyr Tydfil.
