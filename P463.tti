OL,6,F"Rayven is autistic and non-verbal so
OL,7,Fshe likes being outside, so we took
OL,8,Fher outside to play as we do two or
OL,9,Fthree times a day.
OL,11,F"The dog was out as it is, all day
OL,12,Fevery day, and it literally pounced on
OL,13,Fher. We were around five or six feet
OL,14,Faway when it happened and there was no
OL,15,Fwarning, it just went for her.
OL,17,F"I grabbed her face and put my body
OL,18,Fover her and some young lad in the
OL,19,Fstreet, an 18-year-old, opened the
OL,20,Fdog's mouth and got it off my child.
