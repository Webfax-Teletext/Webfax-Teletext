OL,4,FSome viewers reported that the fault
OL,5,Fwas handled differently on the BBC News
OL,6,FChannel, with longer periods of the BBC
OL,7,FNews countdown filler.
OL,9,FThe 30-second period of black and
OL,10,Fsilence was apparently unique to BBC
OL,11,FOne. The countdown filler is reported
OL,12,Fto have kicked in a lot sooner on the
OL,13,FBBC News Channel and remained in place

OL,15,Fprogramme.
