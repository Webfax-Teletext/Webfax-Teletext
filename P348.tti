OL,6,GOfcom has published responses to its
OL,7,Gconsultation on whether to change the
OL,8,Grules on advertising on ITV 1, Channel
OL,9,G4 and Channel 5.
OL,11,FIt is looking at the possibility of
OL,12,Fscrapping the rules which limit the
OL,13,Famount of commercials on these
OL,14,Fchannels.
OL,16,FSubmissions from ITV and Channel 4 both
OL,17,Fargue for changes. Some from purely
OL,18,Fcommercial channels say the current
OL,19,Frules should be kept in place. Ofcom
OL,20,Fstill has not announced its intended
OL,21,Fcourse of action.

OL,6,FThe submissions from ITV and Channel 4
OL,7,Fmake for interesting reading. They
OL,8,Fspell out why the broadcasters might
OL,9,Fwant more flexibility.
OL,11,FInterestingly, ITV says it would not
OL,12,Fwant to show more adverts across the
OL,13,Fday overall, at least initially.
OL,15,FInstead its aim would be:
OL,17,
OL,18,F A full 12 minutes of ads in each hour
OL,19,Fbetween 6pm and 11pm.
OL,20,F Greater flexibility in the scheduling
OL,21,Fof breaks by allowing internal breaks
OL,22,Fof more than 3 minutes 30 seconds.

OL,6,FITV would redistribute some advertising
OL,7,Fairtime from the early afternoon and
OL,8,Flate evenings to balance out the
OL,9,Fincrease in peak time advertising.
OL,11,FThe broadcaster proposes introducing
OL,12,Fthe changes for a trial period. This
OL,13,Fcould assess what the impact on viewers
OL,14,Fand the wider market might be.
OL,16,FSome commercial broadcasters have
OL,17,Fclaimed that allowing more ads on the
OL,18,Fpublic service broadcasters might lead

OL,6,FChannel 4's response highlights what it
OL,7,Fsees as another benefit of relaxing the
OL,8,Frules.
OL,10,FChannel 4 often runs 12 minutes of ads
OL,11,Faround its most popular programmes.
OL,13,FThe rules presently mean that during an
OL,14,Fhour-long slot, it might run three
OL,15,Fbreaks of 3 minutes 30 seconds with a
OL,16,Ffurther 1:30 of ads during the junction
OL,17,Fbefore the next programme.
OL,19,FIf longer internal breaks were allowed,
OL,20,Fit could extend the breaks during the
OL,21,Fprogramme to 4 minutes' duration and
OL,22,Fhave no ads in the junction.

OL,6,FFrom a practical point of view, this
OL,7,Fhas attractions. The ads will reach
OL,8,Fmore eyeballs but a tighter junction
OL,9,Fmight mean that more viewers will stay
OL,10,Ftuned for the next programme.
OL,12,FApplied to ITV 1, this could make it
OL,13,Feasier to squeeze 12 minutes of ads
OL,14,Finto each peak hour without cutting
OL,15,Fprogramme durations.
OL,17,FAs we have explained in previous
OL,18,Fpieces, the biggest changes on ITV 1
OL,19,Fwould be to the 6pm and 10pm hours.

OL,6,FThis could allow the channel to
OL,7,Fproperly monetise the audiences for its
OL,8,Fnews programmes.
OL,10,FIn practice, the extra airtime would
OL,11,Fcome from running fewer ads between 1pm
OL,12,Fand 4pm and none after 11pm.
OL,14,FIt might be assumed that this time
OL,15,Fwould be made up by slightly extending
OL,16,Fthe ITV Lunchtime News or simply
OL,17,Frunning more promotions during early
OL,18,Fafternoon breaks.
