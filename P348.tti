OL,6,GThe 40th anniversary of BBC breakfast
OL,7,GTV was celebrated beautifully. From a
OL,8,Gdesign fan's point of view, there was
OL,9,Gmuch to enjoy.
OL,11,FBringing back the old analogue clock
OL,12,Ffor the morning was a lovely touch. The
OL,13,Fmodern take on the original Breakfast
OL,14,FTime astons was beautifully stylish.
OL,16,FBut there is also a story of how the
OL,17,FBBC finally came to find the right
OL,18,Fformat for breakfast TV after a long
OL,19,Fjourney.

OL,6,FBreakfast Time was an immediate success
OL,7,Fin its early days.
OL,9,FBut once TV-am plunged downmarket and
OL,10,Fsaved itself from disaster, Breakfast
OL,11,FTime started to seem unloved from
OL,12,Fabove.
OL,14,FIt could not compete with its
OL,15,Fdownmarket rival ` nor was it a hard
OL,16,Fnews programme which played to the
OL,17,FBBC's strengths.

OL,6,FYet it was valued, even loved, by its
OL,7,Faudience. Warm and friendly, the
OL,8,Fregular presenters were like extended
OL,9,Ffamily to loyal viewers.
OL,11,FWhen Breakfast Time was relaunched as a
OL,12,Fnews-driven programme in November 1986,
OL,13,Fthe move was controversial.
OL,15,FIt made strategic sense. A clear choice
OL,16,Ffor morning viewers which also gave the
OL,17,Fprogramme a clearer purpose while the
OL,18,Fnew daytime schedule catered for those
OL,19,Fwho wanted the soft features, cookery,
OL,20,Ffashion and chat.

OL,6,FBut the audience clearly took a while
OL,7,Fto get used to a radically different
OL,8,Fprogramme. The atmosphere was very
OL,9,Fdifferent ` sometimes even sterile `
OL,10,Fand many regular presenters and

OL,13,FThis relaunch is sometimes forgotten

OL,7,Fthe subsequent changes into BBC
OL,8,FBreakfast News in 1989 and Breakfast in
OL,9,Fits modern form in 2000 seemed

OL,10,FPerhaps the proof the pioneers got the

OL,12,F20 years ago when Breakfast overtook
