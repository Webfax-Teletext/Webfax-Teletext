OL,7,GUK broadcasting regulator Ofcom says

OL,7,FThe two terrestrial channels (your
OL,8,Flocal ITV station and either Channel
OL,9,F4 or S4C) could command greater fees
OL,10,Ffor ad time due to their vastly
OL,11,Flarger reach.
OL,13,FThree decades later and with every
OL,14,Fhousehold able to receive a variety
OL,15,Fof channels, Ofcom has indicated it's
OL,16,Ftime for change.

OL,7,FOfcom prefers the second option,

OL,9,Fregarding how often a programme on

OL,13,FAlthough not its proposed approach,
