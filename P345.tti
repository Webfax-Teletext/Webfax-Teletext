OL,10,FPresenter Mary Nightingale was

OL,12,Flive from Downing Street, when someone

OL,5,FOn BBC Two Wales, a minor mishap with 
OL,6,Fthe playout schedule meant we got a few
OL,7,Fseconds of BBC One's one rolling news 
OL,8,Fcoverage, rather than the start of    
OL,9,FPointless.                            
OL,11,FThe issue was quickly rectified.      
OL,13,FOn the day that Liz Truss was formally
OL,14,Finstalled as the UK prime minister,   
OL,15,FNewsnight produced a short montage of 
OL,16,Fimages from the day's events,

OL,12,Ftimekeepers though we used the opening
