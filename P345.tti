OL,12,Fsays is due under the terms of its
OL,13,Fexisting contracts with Arqiva.
OL,15,FArqiva says it has taken legal advice

OL,17,Fcompany in turn has raised an
OL,18,Finsurance claim and expects to be
OL,19,Fable to recover some, but not all of

OL,14,FArqiva was blamed for poor

OL,16,Ffire.  As anger over the prolonged

OL,18,Faction, with The Guardian's Jim
