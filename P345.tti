OL,7,Gconsidered impossible happened.
OL,8,GCoronation Street was beaten in the
OL,9,Gratings by the programme on BBC One at
OL,10,Gthe same time.
OL,12,FIt's thought this has only happened
OL,13,Fbefore in special circumstances such as
OL,14,Fwhen an episode of Corrie clashed with
OL,15,Fa major live sporting fixture.
OL,17,FBut on Friday, Beyond Paradise ` a
OL,18,Fspin-off from Death in Paradise ` beat
OL,19,FThe Street by just over 1m viewers in

OL,6,FIt should be stressed that Coronation
OL,7,FStreet's ratings were normal ` instead
OL,8,FBeyond Paradise shored up large numbers
OL,9,Fof those seeking an alternative.
OL,11,FIt's a reminder that the fortunes of
OL,12,Fthe two main channels are no longer as
OL,13,Fclosely intertwined as they used to be
OL,14,Fin an era where multichannel TV is
OL,15,Ftaken for granted.
OL,17,FSo does this add to the argument that

OL,6,FFrankly ITV 1 will not be bothered. As
OL,7,Flong as Corrie's numbers are good, it
OL,8,Fdoesn't matter if another channel
OL,9,Foccasionally wins the slot.
OL,11,FBut there should be a lesson for BBC
OL,12,Fcommissioners and schedulers.
OL,14,FSchedulers should realise that BBC One
OL,15,Fcan beat Corrie and Emmerdale when if
OL,16,Fprovides a high quality alternative.

OL,6,FThose of a certain age remember when
OL,7,FBBC One would often schedule serious
OL,8,Fprogrammes opposite Corrie as there was
OL,9,Fno point wasting the slot on
OL,10,Fentertainment or popular drama.
OL,12,FIt was also the place where
OL,13,Flong-running programmes in decline
OL,14,Fseemed to be sent to die ` Doctor Who
OL,15,Fin the 80s, Top of the Pops in the
OL,16,Fnoughties.
OL,18,FIt also adds to the strategic argument
OL,19,Fthat EastEnders ` now the loser in
OL,20,Fnightly battles with Emmerdale ` should
OL,21,Fhave a different strategic role.

OL,6,FWe've noticed how the BBC seems to be
OL,7,Flosing strategic interest in soaps and
OL,8,Fcontinuing dramas.
OL,10,FDoes the success of Beyond Paradise in
OL,11,Fthat slot add to the argument I made a
