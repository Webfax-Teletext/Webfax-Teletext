OL,5,FHours earlier, social workers had been
OL,6,Fsent to a house in Luxor Street. There
OL,7,Fwas little indication at that stage of
OL,8,Fthe shocking outbreak of disorder
OL,9,Fwhich would follow.
OL,11,FBut that visit became the flashpoint
OL,12,Ffor tension that would escalate into a
OL,13,Fmajor disturbance, with huge crowds
OL,14,Fgathering in the streets, emergency
OL,15,Fworkers coming under attack, vehicles
OL,16,Fbeing set alight and property
OL,17,Fvandalised.
OL,19,FSo how did one isolated incident spark
OL,20,Fscenes of disorder rarely witnessed on
