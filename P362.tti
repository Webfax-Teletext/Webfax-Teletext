OL,4,Ccentre at risk of closure
OL,6,FThe society said the centre is no
OL,7,Flonger financially viable due to an
OL,8,Fincrease in running costs combined
OL,9,Fwith a fall in income from the
OL,10,Finterpreter service and room bookings.
OL,12,FChair of the society, Jason Hixon,
OL,13,Fsaid the centre is a "lifeline" for
OL,14,Fthe community who would be devastated
OL,15,Fif it closed.
OL,17,F"(It) provides interpreters for
OL,18,Fhearing people so that they can
OL,19,Fcommunicate with us. The centre
OL,20,Fprovides a place of relaxation for the
OL,21,Fblind community," he said.

OL,6,FMoreen Wood is a centre user. Four
OL,7,Fgenerations of her family are deaf.
OL,9,FShe said: "For me, this place is like

OL,11,Fclub, I can just be normal. Out there,
OL,12,FI'm not seen as normal.
OL,14,F"For hearing people, the community is
OL,15,Fwhere you live. For deaf people, the
OL,16,Fcommunity is the deaf centre and if it
OL,17,Fcloses it will be a complete normal."
