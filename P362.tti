OL,6,FA cash-strapped council is hoping to
OL,7,Fraise more than #500,000 by selling
OL,8,Foff the city's first registered number
OL,9,Fplate, which is used by the Lord

OL,12,FLeeds City Council believes selling
OL,13,Fthe "U1" plate would help ease budget
OL,14,Fpressures as it faces a projected
OL,15,Fdeficit of #106m for the next
OL,16,Ffinancial year.
OL,18,FRecords show the plate was originally
OL,19,Fbought by Leeds resident Rowland Winn
OL,20,Fshortly after the Motor Car Act was
OL,21,Fpassed in 1903.
