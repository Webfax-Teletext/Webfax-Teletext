OL,6,FBut the playful nod towards Yorkshire
OL,7,Flanguage has prompted irritation from
OL,8,Fthe Yorkshire Dialect Society, which
OL,9,Fsaid it should be written correctly -
OL,10,Fwith the apostrophe after, rather than
OL,11,Fbefore, the letter 't', to indicate
OL,12,Fthe missing letters from the word
OL,13,F"the".
OL,15,FThe society warned the error is
OL,16,Findicative of the decline of the
OL,17,FYorkshire dialect.
