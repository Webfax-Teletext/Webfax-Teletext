OL,6,FA spokesperson said: "We used cameras

OL,8,Fgo we couldn't see it.
OL,10,F"On the second attempt, we caught a
OL,11,Fglimpse of it, but the cave was 12
OL,12,Finches at its widest and got narrower.
OL,13,FThere was no way anyone could get in.
OL,15,F"We would always do everything we can
OL,16,Fto rescue an animal, but this would
OL,17,Frequire drilling and it might risk the
OL,18,Fstructural integrity of the
OL,19,Fsurrounding area.
