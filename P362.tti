OL,4,Cnew baby loss certificates 'pointless'
OL,6,FTwo women from West Yorkshire say the
OL,7,Fnew do not go far enough.
OL,9,FSadie Hawkes, 34, miscarried before
OL,10,Fshe received a maternity exemption
OL,11,Fcertificate, which entitles women to
OL,12,Ffree medication. She had claimed a
OL,13,Ffree course of antibiotics before she
OL,14,Flost her baby.
OL,16,FThe NHS then sent her a letter saying
OL,17,Fshe owed them a #46.75 fine, as well
OL,18,Fas the #9.35 prescription charge,
OL,19,Fbecause she hadn't shown the
OL,20,Fcertificate.

OL,6,FMs Hawkes : "I rang them up straight
OL,7,Faway - explained I've lost my baby and
OL,8,Fassumed they'll say 'that's fine,
OL,9,Fdon't worry'.
OL,11,F"But I was told to get a doctor's note
OL,12,F- which was traumatic."
OL,14,FNow, the NHS Business Service
OL,15,FAuthority has told ITV News Calendar
OL,16,Fthat the new baby loss certificates
OL,17,Fare not legal documents, so they
OL,18,Fcannot be used to prove pregnancy and
OL,19,Ftherefore waive a fine.

OL,6,FThe new certificates, introduced by

OL,8,Fthe grief of mothers who lose babies
OL,9,Fbefore 24 weeks of pregnancy, can be

OL,13,FMs Hakwes, from Otley, said: "What is

OL,6,F"This has really spurred me on,

OL,11,FShe's now setting up a petition

OL,13,Fcertificates legally binding.
OL,15,FMs Hawkes added: "You can't claim the

OL,10,FAn ITV News Calendar investigation
