OL,7,F"rogue bailiffs" after claims a
OL,8,Fconstituent was threatened with the

OL,12,FLuke Charters said firms should be put

OL,16,FThe Labour MP for York Outer said

OL,6,FMr Charters introduced the Regulations
OL,7,Fof Bailiffs Bill through a 10-minute
OL,8,Frule motion in parliament. It would
OL,9,Frequire the Secretary of State to
OL,10,Fpublish an assessment of the
OL,11,Feffectiveness of current regulations,
OL,12,Fand report to Parliament on the
OL,13,Fpotential merits of statutory
OL,14,Fregulation.
OL,16,FHe said: "We are in this place to
OL,17,Fspeak up, when others can't, to put
OL,18,Fright what is clearly wrong.
OL,20,F"This Bill, to get a grip on rogue
OL,21,Fbailiffs, does exactly that."
