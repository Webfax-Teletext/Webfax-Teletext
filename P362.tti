OL,7,FKirklees magistrates heard how an
OL,8,FRSPCA officer, accompanied by police,

OL,10,Fhim after witnesses had described
OL,11,Fseeing him "whack" Moschino with the
OL,12,Fshovel and "stomp" on his head.
OL,14,FThe court heard Price was initially
OL,15,Fcalm but his demeanour then instantly
OL,16,Fchanged when the allegation was put to
OL,17,Fhim.
OL,19,FPrice then became verbally aggressive
OL,20,Fand started shouting and threatening
OL,21,Fthe officers.
