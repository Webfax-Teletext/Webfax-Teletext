OL,7,Fcorrespondent Charanpreet Khaira
OL,9,FThese new constituency boundaries were
OL,10,Frecommended by independent commissions
OL,11,F- they weren't designed to benefit any
OL,12,Fone party over the others.
OL,14,FBut there'll always be winners and
OL,15,Flosers, and the new boundaries mean
OL,16,Fthat nationally, the Conservatives
OL,17,Fgain seven seats, while Labour loses

OL,12,FAs you can see from the map above,
OL,13,Fthere are some significant changes in

OL,15,Fhas now disappeared, for example.
OL,17,FPudsey is now part of the Leeds West
