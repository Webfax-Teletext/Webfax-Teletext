OL,4,Cminers 'benefited communities'
OL,6,FLord Heseltine has said the
OL,7,Fgovernment's victory over striking
OL,8,Fminers in the 1980s brought "great
OL,9,Fbenefit" to pit communities.
OL,11,FToday, 5 March, marks 40 years since
OL,12,Fminers at Cortonwood Colliery in South
OL,13,FYorkshire walked out in what signalled
OL,14,Fthe start of one of the most
OL,15,Facrimonious industrial disputes in
OL,16,FBritish history.

OL,6,FLord Heseltine was at the heart of
OL,7,FMargaret Thatcher's government when
OL,8,Fthe party took on the National Union
OL,9,Fof Mineworkers, led by Arthur
OL,10,FScargill, following the announcement
OL,11,Fthat 20 pits would be closed, with the
OL,12,Floss of 20,000 jobs.
OL,14,FThe dispute resulted in the severe
OL,15,Fweakening of the NUM and, ultimately,
OL,16,Fthe closure of most of the country's
OL,17,Fcoal mines, along with the loss of
OL,18,Ftens of thousands of jobs in the
OL,19,Fcommunities built around them.
