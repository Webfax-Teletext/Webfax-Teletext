OL,3,CWhat happened to Lindsay Rimer?
OL,5,FAt the end of 1994 images of Lindsay
OL,6,FRimer adorned almost every shop window
OL,7,Fin Hebden Bridge.
OL,9,FIt was in one of those shops that the
OL,10,F13-year-old had last been seen.
OL,12,FLindsay had gone to the Spar store
OL,13,Flate on 7 November of that year to buy
OL,14,Fcornflakes for breakfast the following
OL,15,Fmorning. At 10.23pm she left the shop.
OL,17,FA few minutes later a couple of bus
OL,18,Fpassengers saw her leaning against a
OL,19,Fwall. And then nothing.

OL,7,Fhad dropped into the nearby Trades
OL,8,FClub, where Geri was meeting friends,
OL,9,Fto get money for the shop.
OL,11,FBy the time Geri got home, she and her

OL,13,Fdescribed as a bright, inquisitive,
OL,14,Findependent girl - had simply arrived
OL,15,Fback and gone straight to bed.
OL,17,FThe alarm was only raised the
