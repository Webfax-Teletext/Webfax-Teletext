OL,6,FThe Archbishop of York has warned that

OL,8,Fother' especially strangers in his
OL,9,FChristmas Day sermon.
OL,11,FThe Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell
OL,12,Fsaid: "We have become - and really, I
OL,13,Fcan think of no other way of putting
OL,14,Fit - we have become fearful of each
OL,15,Fother, and especially fearful of
OL,16,Fstrangers, or just people who aren't
OL,17,Fquite like us.
OL,19,F"We don't seem to be able to see
OL,20,Fourselves in them, and therefore we
OL,21,Fspurn our common humanity."

OL,8,Fduring a visit to the Holy Land this
OL,9,Fyear.
OL,11,FHe said he was stopped at checkpoints
OL,12,Fand that militias told him he could
OL,13,Fnot visit Palestinian families in the

OL,16,FHe described how YMCA charity

OL,6,F"But this Christmas morning here in
OL,7,FYork, as well as thinking about the
OL,8,Fwalls that divide and separate the
OL,9,FHoly Land, I'm also thinking of all
OL,10,Fthe walls and barriers we erect across
OL,11,Fthe whole of the world and, perhaps
OL,12,Fmost alarming, the ones we build
OL,13,Faround ourselves, the ones we
OL,14,Fconstruct in our hearts and minds, and
OL,15,Fof how our fearful shielding of
OL,16,Fourselves from strangers - the
OL,17,Fstrangers we encounter in the homeless
OL,18,Fon our streets, refugees seeking
OL,19,Fasylum, young people starved of
