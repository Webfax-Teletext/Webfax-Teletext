OL,8,Fafter "disgraceful" scenes of disorder
OL,9,Fleft a trail of destruction in one
OL,10,Farea of the city.
OL,12,FThe events in Harehills were sparked
OL,13,Fby an incident at an address in Luxor
OL,14,FStreet around 5pm on Thursday, when
OL,15,Fpolice were called to an "ongoing
OL,16,Fdisturbance" involving agency workers
OL,17,Fand children.
OL,19,FMore people started to arrive at the
OL,20,Flocation and the agency workers and
OL,21,Fchildren were taken to a safe place.
