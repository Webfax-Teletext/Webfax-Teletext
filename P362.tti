OL,8,Fwork itself and bill them for the
OL,9,Fcost, estimated at #700,000.

OL,6,FThe civic trust said there had been an

OL,8,Fa downturn in trade as a result and
OL,9,Fthere was a risk of further

OL,13,FMr Hamilton criticised the delay in

OL,15,Fsaying: "It does seem wrong that a
OL,16,Fcity the size of Leeds is not allowed

OL,18,Fthat it took central government more
