OL,6,FJimmy McLaughlin added: "The way I can

OL,11,FEach of the siblings shares the same

OL,15,FLorraine Williams said: "I set up a

OL,17,FWe interact, we share events. It was

OL,20,F"Even though we don't know each other,
OL,21,Fwe know each other."

OL,4,Clong-lost siblings meet for first time
OL,6,FLorraine always thought she was an
OL,7,Fonly child. Josie had never met Sydney
OL,8,Fand was placed in foster care as a
OL,9,Fchild.
OL,11,FMeanwhile, Jimmy was abandoned as a
OL,12,Fbaby and grew up in an orphanage.
OL,14,FJimmy added: "I never imagined, I
OL,15,Fwould have this kind of family. To
OL,16,Ffind out that I look so much like my
OL,17,Fdad and Josie looks so much like me,
OL,18,Fit's surreal."
