OL,11,FThe team led by Bournemouth University
OL,12,Fhas added specially developed

OL,14,Fmeans that it can self-heal and they

OL,9,Fcould lead to a wider range of

OL,13,FDr Amor Abdelkader, associate

OL,16,Fare following the same process as

OL,19,Fsolidify to cover the crack until the

OL,21,Fwe are doing with our plastics.

OL,14,FThe process involves using nanosheets
OL,15,Fof a material called Mxine which looks
