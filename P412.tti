OL,6,FA young girl from Sierra Leone, who
OL,7,Fsuffers from Blount's Disease has
OL,8,Fundergone life-changing surgery, led
OL,9,Fby an Oxford surgeon, to straighten

OL,12,FFudia, whose condition meant her feet
OL,13,Fpointed inwards, was finding walking a
OL,14,Fstruggle and she found friendships
OL,15,Fhard as a result.
OL,17,FBut Fudia, 10, was operated on by
OL,18,Fpaediatric orthopaedic surgeon Rachel
OL,19,FBuckingham, from Oxford University
OL,20,FHospitals Trust, and is now standing
OL,21,Fstraight and learning to walk again.

OL,6,FRachel Buckingham, who performed the
OL,7,Ffour hour surgery, said: "I will never
OL,8,Fforget the first time I met Fudia. I
OL,9,Fcould see she was struggling with the
OL,10,Fpain of her severely bowed legs.
OL,12,F"Every step was an agonising effort.
OL,13,FHer legs were so severely twisted that
OL,14,Fwalking was a daily battle.
OL,16,F"As a volunteer children's orthopaedic
OL,17,Fsurgeon with Mercy Ships, I've met
OL,18,Fmany children who need urgent surgery,
OL,19,Fbut something about Fudia's quiet
OL,20,Fcourage struck me deeply.
