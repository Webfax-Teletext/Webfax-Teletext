OL,6,FThe British Arachnological Society had
OL,7,Ffeared it was extinct and has
OL,8,Fdescribed it as 'one of Britain's epic
OL,9,Flost species rediscoveries of the
OL,10,Fcentury.'
OL,12,FEntomologist Mark Teller, who made the
OL,13,Fdiscovery with colleague Graeme Lyons,
OL,14,Fsaid the name was inspired by the
OL,15,Fdistinctive pale "knuckles" on its
OL,16,Fpalps ` small leg-like appendages at
OL,17,Fthe side of the mouth ` and a race
OL,18,Fagainst the clock to find it.
OL,20,FHe said: "This is one of those
OL,21,Funforgettable discoveries.
