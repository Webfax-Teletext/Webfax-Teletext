OL,9,Finstalled solar panels on their roof,
OL,10,Fin an effort to reduce their carbon

OL,12,FBut they soon found out it would save

OL,15,FPhil says: "Yes and we've also sold

OL,6,F"An Eco-Open-Home visit is an
OL,7,Fopportunity for you to ask a neighbour
OL,8,Fabout an energy saving improvement
OL,9,Fthat they've made, and see if it might
OL,10,Fwork for you. Throughout September
OL,11,Flocal people who have made energy
OL,12,Fsaving improvements are opening up
OL,13,Ftheir homes to share their
OL,14,Fexperiences. Visiting a home is a
OL,15,Fgreat way to find out about the
OL,16,Freality of getting solar panels,
OL,17,Finsulation, triple glazing, or new
OL,18,Fheating options without talking to a
OL,19,Fsalesman. You can have a good look at
OL,20,Fthe technology, ask the residents
OL,21,Fwhether the installation was a hassle,
OL,22,Fand find out much they're really
OL,23,Fsaving on their energy bills as a
OL,24,Fresult."
