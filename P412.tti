OL,7,FProfessor Phil Banfield, chairman of
OL,8,Fthe BMA council, said NHS bodies and
OL,9,Fthe Government had "collaborated in
OL,10,Fthe headlong rush" to expand PAs and
OL,11,FAAs without first amassing the
OL,12,Fevidence that their role was safe.
OL,14,FHe added: "By maintaining a postcode
OL,15,Flottery, bizarrely supported by the
OL,16,FGeneral Medical Council, in which
OL,17,Fdifferent hospitals can decide what
OL,18,Fphysician associates can and can't do,
OL,19,Fthe NHS has created a genuine public
OL,20,Fpolicy scandal.
