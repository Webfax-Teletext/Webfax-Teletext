OL,7,FChildren's Hospital (SCH) warned the
OL,8,Fparents of the 13-year-old "to prepare
OL,9,Ffor the worst" because of the severity
OL,10,Fof her injuries.
OL,12,FBut seven months later, Aliza Rae is
OL,13,Fback at school and also riding again.
OL,15,FEvan Davies, consultant spinal surgeon
OL,16,Fat SCH, explained the emergency
OL,17,Foperation involved stabilising her
OL,18,Fspine with metal rods and removing
OL,19,Ffractured bone to reduce the pressure

OL,9,Fwasn't connected to the bottom half.
OL,11,F"I was concerned that the damage had
