OL,7,FMedway Council has apologised for
OL,8,Fcreating 'confusion' for children
OL,9,Fsitting this year's Medway Test.
OL,11,FThe test decides which pupils can go
OL,12,Fto grammar school next year.
OL,14,FThe time allocated for the English
OL,15,Fpart of the exam was 30 minutes but
OL,16,Fmany pupils and parents understood
OL,17,Fthat it would run for up to an hour.
