OL,6,FCampaigner Tony Page says he owes his
OL,7,Flife to an NHS dentist who spotted
OL,8,Fmouth cancer during a routine check-up.
OL,10,FMr Page, who's 74, was attending an
OL,11,Fappointment in 2014 when the dentist
OL,12,Fnoticed something "suspicious" in his
OL,13,Fmouth.
OL,15,FHe was referred to the hospital and
OL,16,Ffollowing various tests was diagnosed
OL,17,Fwith mouth cancer.
OL,19,FSix weeks after seeing the dentist, he
OL,20,Fhad an operation which removed part of
OL,21,Fhis tongue and cheek.
