OL,6,FA Hampshire council has issued a plea
OL,7,Ffor help to stop a so-called
OL,8,Fdetectorist from digging holes in a
OL,9,Fpark over concerns it could leave
OL,10,Fvisitors and their pets injured.
OL,12,FRushmoor Borough Council says the
OL,13,Fholes have been appearing regularly in
OL,14,FAldershot Park since May.
OL,16,FThey've described the holes as
OL,17,F"dangerous and unsightly" and want to
OL,18,Ffind out if anyone knows who's
OL,19,Fresponsible.
