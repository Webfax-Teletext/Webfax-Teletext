OL,6,FThames Water is holding its first drop-
OL,7,Fin information event today (10
OL,8,FNovember) to allow the public to find
OL,9,Fout more about its proposed new
OL,10,Freservoir near Abingdon, Oxfordshire.
OL,12,FThe company says the site, which would
OL,13,Fcost between #5.5bn-#7.5bn would be
OL,14,Fone of the largest in the country and
OL,15,Fwould provide water security for the
OL,16,Fnext fifty years.
OL,18,FHowever, campaigners against the
OL,19,Fproject insist it's in the wrong place
OL,20,Fand fixing leaks should be the
OL,21,Fpriority.
