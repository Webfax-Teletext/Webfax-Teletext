OL,6,FDogs Trust Newbury is warning pet

OL,8,Ftemperatures across the South remain
OL,9,Fhigh.
OL,11,FThe charity says many owners are
OL,12,Funaware that dogs can overheat at
OL,13,Falmost any temperature, which poses
OL,14,Fserious health risks.
OL,16,F75% of heatstroke cases are linked to
OL,17,Fexercise, and around two-thirds of
OL,18,Freported cases occur following a
OL,19,Fsimple walk.

OL,7,Fheatstroke, but certain breeds,
OL,8,Fincluding "flat-faced" dogs such as
OL,9,FPugs, French Bulldogs, and English
OL,10,FBulldogs, are at significantly higher
OL,11,Frisk, the charity says.
OL,13,FThis is due to their compromised
OL,14,Fability to regulate body temperature
OL,15,Fand narrow airways. Older dogs,
OL,16,Foverweight dogs and dogs with certain
