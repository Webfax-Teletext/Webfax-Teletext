OL,6,FAn angling charity has issued urgent
OL,7,Fadvice after a fisherman became
OL,8,Fseriously ill and collapsed after
OL,9,Ffishing in a Berkshire river.
OL,11,FMark Erdwin had spent the day casting
OL,12,Ffrom a riverbank near Finchampstead
OL,13,Fbut was rushed to hospital after
OL,14,Fbecoming violently ill following a
OL,15,Fdays fishing on the River Blackwater
OL,16,Fnear Eversley.
OL,18,FMark, who has been an angler for more
OL,19,Fthan 35 years, was found to be
OL,20,Fsuffering from the deadly E. coli
OL,21,Fbacteria.

OL,7,Furgently about the water quality of
OL,8,Fthe river.
OL,10,FMark said: "I feel we're at a tipping

OL,12,Fwhether they're anglers, paddle
OL,13,Fboarders or dog walkers, could fall

OL,16,FMark Erdwin spent several hours
OL,17,Fcasting from the river bank that day,
OL,18,Fwhen he decided to take a break.

OL,6,FUnlike normal, he didn't use hand
OL,7,Fsanitiser before eating his lunch, as
OL,8,Fhe'd forgotten to refill it.
OL,10,FHe said: "I was hungry so when I got

OL,12,Fto eat. In over thirty five years of
OL,13,Ffishing I've never become ill like

OL,17,FHospital tests revealed he was

OL,13,F"Government advice is that rivers and
OL,14,Fother open water locations that are
OL,15,Fnot designated as bathing waters are
OL,16,Fmanaged for the purpose of protecting
OL,17,Ffish and wildlife, not people, so
