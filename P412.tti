OL,10,F"I came running out and all I could

OL,13,Fwas expecting them to break," said

OL,6,FITV Meridian meteorologist Philippa
OL,7,FDrew says it's unusual for one to
OL,8,Fcause such damage.
OL,10,F"We do see a fair few dust devils here

OL,12,Fshort-lived and any ill effects are
OL,13,Fusually very much at ground level and
OL,14,Fdamage is usually limited,"
OL,16,F"To have your roof tiles lifted away,
OL,17,Feven on a bungalow is pretty unlucky."
