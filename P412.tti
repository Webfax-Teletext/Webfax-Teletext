OL,7,FInterviewed 23 February 2024
OL,9,FManning an Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun
OL,10,Fon a Landing Craft Flak on D-Day, Mr
OL,11,FBudding had been based in Portsmouth
OL,12,Ffor weeks leading up to the invasion
OL,13,Fand saw the massive build up of ships
OL,14,Fthere.
OL,16,F"A lot of them were tied up to bouys
OL,17,Fin the middle of the harbour," he said.
OL,19,F"Some couldn't even get into the
OL,20,Fharbour. They were outside tying up to
OL,21,Feach other.

OL,5,F"If you saw all these ships side by
OL,6,Fside fastened together you could walk
OL,7,Ffrom one side of the harbour to the
OL,8,Fother across these vessels. It was an
OL,9,Feye opener and we were seeing vessels
OL,10,Fwe didn't know existed - rocket-firing
OL,11,Fcraft.
OL,13,F"The whole of the upper deck was taken
OL,14,Fover with rockets."
OL,16,FHis landing craft, LCF 34, was
OL,17,Fspecially adapted to give anti-
OL,18,Faircraft support and offered covering
OL,19,Ffire for the first and second wave of
OL,20,Ftroops on Sword Beach.

OL,5,F"We had five of those rocket ships at
OL,6,Four rear," he added.
OL,8,F"And they started letting the rockets
OL,9,Fgo and it was scary because flames
OL,10,Fwere shooting from the rear of them as
OL,11,Fthey were airborne, and there were
OL,12,Fthat many in the air they were
OL,13,Fcolliding with each other and diving
OL,14,Finto the sea and we were scared stiff
OL,15,Fthey would land on our upper deck

OL,5,FMr Budding said: "As (our troops) were
OL,6,Fhitting the beach we were opening fire
OL,7,Fat the top floor windows.
OL,9,F"There were lines of semi detached
OL,10,Fhouses all the way along the back of
OL,11,Fthe beach and at each upper window was
OL,12,Fsandbags and in the centre was either
OL,13,Fa machine gun or a mortar and they
OL,14,Fwere firing at our lads but we were
OL,15,Fhitting them.
OL,17,F"Our range was far greater.
OL,19,F"They were taking cover a lot of the
OL,20,Ftime when things were getting too hot
OL,21,Ffor them."

OL,5,FThe gunners on the landing craft were
OL,6,Fso busy and he remembers at one time
OL,7,Ffiring 486 rounds without stopping.
OL,9,FNormally gunners would have to stop
OL,10,Fbefore that, he said, because the
OL,11,Fbarrels would become red hot.
OL,13,F"There wasn't a lot of damage to us
OL,14,Fbecause they were concentrating on
OL,15,Fsoldiers on the beach," he added.
OL,17,F"I didn't actually see them being
OL,18,Fgunned down but I saw some bodies
OL,19,Flying on the beach afterwards.
