OL,5,F"Arromanches was the main part where
OL,6,Fwe were landing. We were already
OL,7,Fhaving a lot of casualties and so I
OL,8,Fwas called up to be the radio operator
OL,9,Fin the tank crew."
OL,11,FA few days later the Sherman tank Mr
OL,12,FHayward was in took a direct hit from
OL,13,Fan enemy shell.
OL,15,F"On this particular morning we were in
OL,16,Fa lane and an infantry sergeant
OL,17,Fapproached us and said he was being
OL,18,Fheld up by something, probably a tank
OL,19,Fso we took him on board to show us
OL,20,Fwhere he was having the problem.

OL,5,F"We moved down the lane and suddenly
OL,6,Fthere was a very large thud at the
OL,7,Ffront of our tank and we tried to
OL,8,Freverse and get out of trouble.
OL,10,F"But another shell arrived and this
OL,11,Ftime it penetrated and landed round
OL,12,Fand about my feet and there was an
OL,13,Fexplosion.
OL,15,F"It became absolutely essential that

OL,5,F"The crew all left alright but the
OL,6,Fsergeant obviously didn't know what
OL,7,Fwas happening and before I could get
OL,8,Fout I had to get him out of the
OL,9,Fcockpit and I then managed to crawl
OL,10,Faway from the tank which was beginning
OL,11,Fto get a bit hot.
OL,13,F"In the time I was getting out I had
OL,14,Freceived burns to my right hand and I
OL,15,Fsaw my right leg was completely
OL,16,Fsmashed below the knee and I had lost
OL,17,Fthe front of my left foot.

OL,5,F"I found subsequently there was enough

OL,7,Fstand otherwise I would not have got
OL,8,Fout of that tank.
OL,10,F"Saved my life, yes. Within a minute

OL,15,FMy Hayward was returned to Portsmouth
