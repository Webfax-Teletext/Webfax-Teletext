OL,6,GThe speculation was intense. The BBC
OL,7,GDirector-General's speech on Tuesday
OL,8,Gwas, the headlines said, set to
OL,9,Gannounce some of the biggest changes
OL,10,Gin the corporation's history.
OL,12,FMeanwhile the corporation's annual
OL,13,Fplan, published later in the week, was
OL,14,Fpresumed to be set to reveal the fate
OL,15,Fof some significant programmes and
OL,16,Fservices.
OL,18,FThere was, at least in retrospect,
OL,19,Fmore than a bit of hyperbole by some
OL,20,Fcommentators.

OL,6,FTim Davie's speech was genuinely
OL,7,Fsignificant and set out a blueprint
OL,8,Ffor the way forward.
OL,10,FThere are important questions about
OL,11,Fthe BBC's future role. News coverage
OL,12,Ffocused on the question of the future
OL,13,Fof the TV licence.
OL,15,FIt is certainly interesting that the
OL,16,Fcorporation is not wedded to the
OL,17,Flicence in its traditional form and is
OL,18,Fopen to the possibility of reform.

OL,7,Fsuggestions of subscription funding,

OL,9,Fadvertising.
OL,11,FRather the question is whether there
OL,12,Fmight be a way of making the fee
OL,13,Ffairer and how to ensure those who
OL,14,Fdon't have TV sets can stop taking
OL,15,Fadvantage of BBC content for free.
OL,17,FAs I said last week, the mood music

OL,19,Fbe very different if Labour is in
OL,20,Fpower after the General Election.

OL,10,FTo be fair though, most of the
OL,11,Fprogrammes he mentioned had probably
