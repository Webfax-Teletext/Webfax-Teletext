OL,6,GIf you're a regular viewer of Good
OL,7,GMorning Britain on ITV 1 you may have
OL,8,Gnoticed a little change last week.
OL,10,FThe regional news bulletins have been
OL,11,Freconfigured.
OL,13,FThe bulletin previously shown at
OL,14,Fapproximately 8.10am has gone although
OL,15,Fthe regional weather forecast remains.
OL,17,FBut the two other bulletins ` at
OL,18,Fapproximately 6.25am and 7.10am ` are
OL,19,Fnow slightly longer, running to three
OL,20,Fminutes including the weather.
