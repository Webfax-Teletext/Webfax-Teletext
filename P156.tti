OL,6,GThis has been an important week for
OL,7,Gthe development of HD television. It
OL,8,Gis fast becoming the norm for major
OL,9,Gchannels.

OL,12,Flooming closure of its SD services on
OL,13,Fsatellite.
OL,15,FThen ITV announced that Channel and
OL,16,FBorder Scotland would soon be
OL,17,Favailable in HD on Sky and Freesat.
OL,19,FIt will close more SD ITV 1 regions

OL,6,FThen Sky surprised many by making the
OL,7,Frevamped Pick TV, now branded as Sky
OL,8,FMix, available in HD to Freesat
OL,9,Fviewers.
OL,11,FThis appears to indicate a change in
OL,12,Fpolicy by the company which had
OL,13,Fpreviously only made its own HD
OL,14,Fchannels available to subscribers.
OL,16,FIt is increasingly hard to justify
OL,17,Fthe cost of providing separate SD and
OL,18,FHD versions of the same channel on
OL,19,Fsatellite.

OL,6,FAt least 98pc of satellite viewers

OL,9,Fanticipation of the closure of BBC SD

OL,11,Feven higher. Perhaps some SD boxes
OL,12,Fare lying dormant?
OL,14,FI would bet that ITV will close all
OL,15,Fits SD feeds within months. It is
OL,16,Fhard to imagine any row over this
OL,17,Fonce BBC SD services cease.
