OL,7,Fhas "hindered" the cause of Scottish
OL,8,Findependence, former party leader and
OL,9,Fex- Scottish first minister Alex
OL,10,FSalmond has claimed.
OL,12,FMr Salmond also said there is no way
OL,13,F"immediately" for another independence
OL,14,Freferendum to be held, as he
OL,15,Fcriticised his successor, Nicola
OL,16,FSturgeon, for her "ill-fated,
