OL,6,FDrinking coffee in the morning could
OL,7,Fbring more health benefits than
OL,8,Fdrinking a few cups throughout the
OL,9,Fday, according to a new study.
OL,11,FResearchers wanted to assess whether
OL,12,Fthe time of day people drink coffee
OL,13,Fhas any impact on their health.
OL,15,FThey studied more than 40,000 adults
