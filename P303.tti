OL,6,FIt is testament to the UK's world-

OL,8,Fthis year's Nobel prize winners (so
OL,9,Ffar) were born and educated in the UK.
OL,11,FThey are Johnson and Robinson for
OL,12,Feconomics (announced today), Hinton
OL,13,Ffor physics and Hassabis for chemistry.

OL,6,FThis is cause for pride and

OL,8,Fdepressing that to fulfil their
OL,9,Fextraordinary potential, all four felt
OL,10,Fobliged either to move to North
