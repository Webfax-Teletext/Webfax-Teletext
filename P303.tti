OL,8,FWednesday the US has submitted a draft
OL,9,Fresolution to the UN Security Council
OL,10,Fthat calls "for an immediate
OL,11,Fceasefire" in Gaza that's "tied to the
OL,12,Frelease" of hostages held by Hamas.
OL,14,FIn an interview with Al-Hadath in
OL,15,FJeddah, Saudi Arabia, Blinken said
OL,16,Fthat an agreement was "getting closer"
OL,17,Fand "the gaps are narrowing,"

OL,7,F"I think the gaps are narrowing, and I

OL,11,F"We worked very hard with Qatar, with
OL,12,FEgypt, and with Israel to put a strong
OL,13,Fproposal on the table. We did that;
OL,14,FHamas wouldn't accept it. They came
OL,15,Fback with other requests, other
OL,16,Fdemands. The negotiators are working
OL,17,Fon that right now," Blinken explained.
