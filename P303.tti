OL,6,FEven before he had started his make-or-
OL,7,Fbreak press conference, Joe Biden had
OL,8,Fdropped a diplomatic clanger for the
OL,9,Fages.
OL,11,FHe introduced President Zelenskyy as
OL,12,FPresident Putin, before a few seconds
OL,13,Flater realising his excruciating
OL,14,Fmistake and correcting himself.
OL,16,FI was in the NATO press centre at the

OL,18,Fthe gaff was beamed to hundreds of
OL,19,Fjournalists.

OL,6,FIt only added to the pressure on the

OL,9,FBut within a few minutes of the press
OL,10,Fconference starting, there was another
OL,11,Fagonising name mix-up when he referred
OL,12,Fto his Vice President Kamala Harris as
OL,13,FVice President Trump.
OL,15,FBy then the damage was done. President

OL,19,Fhour.

OL,7,Fthat his allies inside the Democratic

OL,10,FAt times, he rambled and was painfully

OL,13,Fwith an "Anyway".
