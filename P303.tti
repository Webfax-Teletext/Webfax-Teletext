OL,6,FThe SNP is "running scared" of the

OL,9,Fhas said.
OL,11,FAnnouncing his candidacy for the SNP
OL,12,Fleadership on Thursday, Mr Swinney
OL,13,Fdismissed the push for the country to
OL,14,Fgo to the polls as a "red herring".
OL,16,FBut Scottish Labour deputy leader Dame
OL,17,FJackie Baillie said there should be a
OL,18,FHolyrood poll as well as the upcoming
OL,19,FUK general election "to boot both of
