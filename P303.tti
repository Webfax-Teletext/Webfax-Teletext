OL,8,FHolidaying in the UK is about to
OL,9,Fchange for anyone outside of the
OL,10,FEuropean Union, as travel without pre-
OL,11,Fauthorisation is coming to an end.
OL,13,FNon-Europeans visiting or transiting
OL,14,Fthrough the UK without a visa will
OL,15,Fneed to obtain a #10 digital permit as
OL,16,Fof Wednesday 8 January.
OL,18,FThe Home Office is extending the
OL,19,Felectronic travel authorisation (ETA)
OL,20,Fsystem, which was first introduced in
OL,21,FNovember 2023.
