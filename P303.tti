OL,4,Cweather type
OL,6,FAfter what has seemed like weeks of
OL,7,Fcold, cloudy and largely dry repeated
OL,8,Fad nauseam, our weather will finally
OL,9,Fstart to become more mobile and
OL,10,Fvariable.
OL,12,FYes we'll all see wind and rain over
OL,13,Fthe next few days - for some this
OL,14,Fcould be quite significant - but in
OL,15,Fbetween, the promise of something
OL,16,Fmilder and brighter at last.
OL,18,FSo why are we seeing such a big shift
OL,19,Fin weather type?

OL,6,FIt's not necessarily that the actual

OL,3,CWhy we're about to see a big shift in
OL,4,Cweather type
OL,6,FIt's already begun! Wind and rain
OL,7,Fwarnings were in force today as
OL,8,FAtlantic fronts brought wet and windy
OL,9,Fweather to western areas.
OL,11,FAnd, as the mild tropical maritime
OL,12,Fairmass moved in, overnight
OL,13,Ftemperatures responded with overnight
OL,14,Flows staying up in double figures in
OL,15,FLondon on Thursday night (12C) and
OL,16,Fparts of Cambridgeshire recorded the

OL,6,FIn short, yes. Heavy rain and strong
OL,7,Fwinds - particularly across western
OL,8,Fareas - could cause localised flooding
OL,9,Fand disruption to transport. You are

OL,6,FThe westerly set-up for the UK's

OL,8,Fweek, with showers or some longer
OL,9,Fspells of rain likely at times. After
