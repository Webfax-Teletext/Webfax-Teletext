OL,6,FSir Keir Starmer has said he did not
OL,7,Fget to grips with the growing
OL,8,Frebellion over welfare reforms earlier
OL,9,Fas he was focused on international
OL,10,Faffairs.
OL,12,FHe also said he took ownership for his
OL,13,Fdecisions and believed as leader he
OL,14,Fshould "carry the can" when things do
OL,15,Fnot go well.
OL,17,FThe Prime Minister said he was
OL,18,Foccupied with the G7 and Nato summits
OL,19,Fand the escalating tensions in the
OL,20,FMiddle East for much of the past two
OL,21,Fweeks.
