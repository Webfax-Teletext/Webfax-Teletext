OL,11,FTrail hunting mimics a traditional

OL,6,FBut trail hunting has remained legal
OL,7,Fbecause it does not explicitly involve
OL,8,Fkilling animals.
OL,10,FAlthough, Environment minister
OL,11,FBaroness Hayman said she believed the
OL,12,Fpractice was being used to cover up
OL,13,Fillegal hunting.
OL,15,F"There is evidence that trail hunting
