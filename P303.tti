OL,6,FEight-year-old Sama, who has lost her
OL,7,Fhair amid the Gaza war, says she is
OL,8,F"surprised" when she sees herself in
OL,9,Fthe mirror, as ITV News Correspondent
OL,10,FJohn Ray reports
OL,12,FWar consumes so much and leaves its
OL,13,Fvictims with so little. For an eight-
OL,14,Fyear-old girl in Gaza, called Sama,
OL,15,Fit's her dignity that's been lost.
OL,17,FIt takes her some courage to remove
OL,18,Fher pink head scarf. Her once
OL,19,Fbeautiful hair is gone. It is a
OL,20,Fmeasure of her trauma.
