OL,6,F"It was just me and my friend, the

OL,13,FThe 57-year-old said she was not a

OL,15,Ftowards drinking every day "when
OL,16,Fthings got bad over the past year".
OL,18,F"I established a routine of drinking
OL,19,Fthen punishing myself with hard work
OL,20,Fthrough my hangover," she said.
