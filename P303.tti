OL,9,FJust a few days after Donald Trump was
OL,10,Fhosted at Windsor Castle and provided
OL,11,Fwith all the pomp and ceremony that
OL,12,FBritain can muster, Trump decided to
OL,13,Ftrash-talk the country.
OL,15,FHe stood on the most prestigious
OL,16,Fglobal stage of all, the United
OL,17,FNations podium, watched by dozens of
OL,18,Fworld leaders and hundreds of
OL,19,Fdiplomats, and bitterly criticised the
OL,20,FUnited Kingdom.

OL,10,Fthe use of wind turbines. Trump claims
OL,11,Fthey ruin the English and Scottish

OL,13,Fenergy a scam.
OL,15,FAnd here's the point.
