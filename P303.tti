OL,6,FPhillipson's speech to Parliament on
OL,7,FWednesday marked a shift from when she
OL,8,Flast addressed the issue in July.
OL,10,F"For too long, universities have been

OL,12,Fwith contempt, rather than as a public
OL,13,Fgood, distracting people from the core
OL,14,Fissues they face", she told MPs last

OL,17,FShe said she'd ordered the legislation
OL,18,Fto be stopped, warning that it "could
OL,19,Fexpose students to harm and appalling
OL,20,Fhate speech on campuses".
