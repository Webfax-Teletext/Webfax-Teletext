OL,6,FThe number of people in Scotland's

OL,8,FScottish Prison Service (SPS) has said.
OL,10,FThere were 8,430 people behind bars on
OL,11,FTuesday, above the previous high of
OL,12,F8,420, with the fluctuating figure
OL,13,Fremaining above 8,400 for the whole

OL,16,FThe operating capacity of the prison
OL,17,Festate is 7,805, meaning a new prison
OL,18,Fthe size of HMP Grampian or HMP Shotts
OL,19,Fwould be needed to cover the
OL,20,Fovercrowding, according to the SPS.
