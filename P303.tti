OL,10,FFirst, as I said on News at Ten last
OL,11,Fnight, this is as important an
OL,12,Fappointment as to a very senior

OL,6,FWithin hours of Trump's inauguration

OL,3,CWhy Starmer picked Mandelson for

OL,6,FIn the words of one senior politician,
OL,7,Fwho is no friend of Mandelson, "Trump
OL,8,Flikes people he can make a connection
OL,9,Fwith - and Mandy is personable and
OL,10,Funderstands power and connections."
OL,12,FBut there are also risks, and not just
OL,13,Fthat Mandelson doesn't play golf.
OL,15,FOne of the big reasons Mandelson is
OL,16,Fexpert in trade issues is because he
OL,17,Fwas EU trade commissioner.
