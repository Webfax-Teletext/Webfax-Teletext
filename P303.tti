OL,6,FDiane Abbott has been suspended from
OL,7,Fthe Labour Party for a second time

OL,10,Fapologised.
OL,12,FThe Hackney North and Stoke Newington
OL,13,FMP said the Labour leadership "wants
OL,14,Fme out" and that her comments in a BBC
OL,15,Finterview released this week were
OL,16,F"factually correct".
OL,18,FIt comes a day after Sir Keir Starmer
OL,19,Fstripped the whip from four Labour MPs
