OL,6,FPrime Minister Keir Starmer has backed
OL,7,FVolodymyr Zelenskyy as "Ukraine's
OL,8,Fdemocratically elected leader" after
OL,9,FDonald Trump claimed he was a
OL,10,F"dictator" who was doing a "terrible
OL,11,Fjob".
OL,13,FIn a phone call with the Ukrainian
OL,14,Fpresident, Starmer said it was
OL,15,F"perfectly reasonable to suspend
OL,16,Felections during war time as the UK
OL,17,Fdid during World War Two", according
OL,18,Fto a Downing Street spokesperson.
