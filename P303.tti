OL,7,FOn June 15 crowds across Spanish
OL,8,Ftourist hotspots protested against
OL,9,Fmass tourism. There was shouting,
OL,10,Fflares, and the water pistols that
OL,11,Fhave become a symbol of
OL,12,F'tourismphobia'.
OL,14,FAs protests in Spain have ramped up,
OL,15,Fthe number of tourists visiting has
OL,16,Fdropped. New figures from May show a
