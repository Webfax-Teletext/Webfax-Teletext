OL,6,FMeatly, the manufacturer, said the
OL,7,Fchicken meat was produced from a
OL,8,Fsingle sample of cells taken from one
OL,9,Fchicken egg, from which enough
OL,10,Fcultivated meat could be produced to
OL,11,Ffeed pets "forever".
OL,13,FIt said the meat contains all the

OL,15,Facids, minerals and vitamins needed
OL,16,Ffor pet health, and is just as "tasty"
OL,17,Fas "traditional" chicken breast.

OL,6,FRetailer Pets at Home said it believed
OL,7,Fit was the first company in the world
OL,8,Fto sell cultivated meat for pet food.
OL,10,FMeatly founder Owen Ensor said the

OL,12,Fthe pet food industry.
OL,14,F"Just two years ago, this felt like a

OL,16,Fsaid. "It's a giant leap forward,
OL,17,Ftoward a significant market for meat

OL,6,FLab-grown meat has proved a divisive
OL,7,Ftopic in some countries. While
OL,8,Fadvocates point to the environmental
OL,9,Fand animal welfare benefits, critics
OL,10,Fsay the meat is expensive, and could
OL,11,Fnegatively impact farmers.
OL,13,FIn Singapore, regulators allowed
OL,14,Fcultivated meat to be sold in
OL,15,Frestaurants in December 2020. The US
OL,16,Fand Israel have also approved the
OL,17,Fproducts for human consumption.
OL,19,FIn the UK, approval has only been
OL,20,Fgranted for pet food, and not for
OL,21,Fconsumption by people.
