OL,12,FShabana Mahmood said there was a need

OL,15,Fbeen "fundamentally shaken, if not

OL,6,FA "rapid" audit, led by Baroness
OL,7,FLouise Casey and looking at the scale
OL,8,Fof grooming gangs across England and
OL,9,FWales, had been expected to report

OL,12,FDowning Street has said the process is
OL,13,Fconcluding this month and the findings
OL,14,Fwill be published in "due course".
OL,16,FIn an interview with the Spectator

OL,6,F"But the way that this scandal has

OL,11,Fdoesn't feel like proper
