OL,4,Cdisorder as 'deeply flawed'
OL,6,FSinn Fein has labelled a report into
OL,7,Fdisorder in the Dail on Tuesday as
OL,8,F"deeply flawed".
OL,10,FThe report, written by the clerk of
OL,11,Fthe Dail, Peter Finnegan, analysed
OL,12,Fwhether the decisions made by Ceann
OL,13,FComhairle Verona Murphy adhered to
OL,14,FDail rules.
OL,16,FHe concluded that her actions on the
OL,17,Forder of business, questions on policy
OL,18,For legislation, and a motion to
OL,19,Famendment standing orders adhered to
OL,20,FDail rules.
