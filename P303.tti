OL,6,FSunshine and a welcome rise in
OL,7,Ftemperatures have been putting a
OL,8,Fspring in the step of many this week -
OL,9,Fbut the amount of sunshine and just
OL,10,Fhow warm it will feel can be very
OL,11,Fdifferent depending on where in the

OL,14,FAnd I'm not just talking the usual
OL,15,Fnorth/south split; conditions east to

OL,17,Ftoday and tomorrow are dramatically
OL,18,Fdifferent! The reason? Something
OL,19,Fcalled the Foehn Effect.
OL,21,FSo what is the Foehn Effect?

OL,3,CWhat is the Foehn Effect and why does
OL,4,Cit give warmer, sunnier days?
OL,6,FThe foehn effect is a weather
OL,7,Fphenomenon that creates very different
OL,8,Fweather types on either side of a high
OL,9,Fground due to the way the air modifies
OL,10,Fas it rises and then falls.
OL,12,FWhen moist air meets high ground, it
OL,13,Fis forced to rise, and as it rises, it
OL,14,Fcools, causing the moisture in the air
OL,15,Fto condense, creating cloud and rain.
OL,17,FThat cloud cover, in turn, often gives
OL,18,Fcooler temperatures too due to lack of
OL,19,Fsunshine.

OL,3,CWhat is the Foehn Effect and why does
OL,4,Cit give warmer, sunnier days?
OL,6,FThat now drier air then descends down
OL,7,Fthe sheltered side of high ground,
OL,8,Frapidly warming as it does so,
OL,9,Fresulting in a warm and dry wind on
OL,10,Fthe downhill side. With less moisture
OL,11,Fin the air, conditions are sunnier and
OL,12,Fwarmer.
OL,14,FThat gives us the result of cooler,
OL,15,Fcloudier, wetter weather on the
OL,16,Fprevailing side and drier, brighter
OL,17,Fand consequently warmer weather on the
OL,18,Fsheltered side.
OL,20,FHow often does it happen?
