OL,8,FBritain has made up its mind - there
OL,9,Fis too much immigration. It might even
OL,10,Fbe the one issue that unites our

OL,13,FThat, at least, is the most obvious
OL,14,Freading of analysis commissioned by
OL,15,FITV News from the Institute of Public
OL,16,FPolicy Research (IPPR).
OL,18,FPolling also suggests that almost half
OL,19,Fthe population feels the government
OL,20,Fshould tackle immigration and border
OL,21,Fsecurity in the upcoming Autumn budget.

OL,6,FThat's second only to the cost of
OL,7,Fliving crisis and ahead of the NHS.
OL,9,FYou can see the IPPR findings below.
OL,10,FThey are based upon a survey of 3,000
OL,11,Fpeople ` a cross-section of Britain.
OL,13,FBut a closer look at the data reveals
