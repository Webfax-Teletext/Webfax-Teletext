OL,6,FThe Prime Minister has told a summit
OL,7,Fthat the UK and other countries
OL,8,Faffected by people smuggling must
OL,9,Fstand together against the "vile
OL,10,Ftrade" rather than be divided by it.
OL,12,FStarmer urged 40 countries meeting in
OL,13,FLondon on Monday and Tuesday to tackle
OL,14,Fpeople-smuggling gangs with the same
OL,15,Furgency as terrorist threats.
OL,17,FThe PM told delegates the scale of
OL,18,Fillegal immigration made him "angry",
OL,19,Fsaying for too long the UK has been a
OL,20,F"soft-touch".
