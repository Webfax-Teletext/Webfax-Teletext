OL,7,FEarlier this month, the UK Government
OL,8,Fagreed plans to allow around 40
OL,9,Fstudents in Gaza, who have been
OL,10,Foffered fully-funded scholarships at
OL,11,FUK universities, to complete their
OL,12,Fimmigration applications.
OL,14,FThe home secretary Yvette Cooper says
OL,15,Fshe will allow dozens of students to
OL,16,Fhave their biometric checks carried
OL,17,Fout in a safe third country before
OL,18,Fthey travel to the UK to take up their
OL,19,Fplaces in September. But the reality
OL,20,Fon the ground in Gaza is making it
OL,21,Fhard for students to complete them.
