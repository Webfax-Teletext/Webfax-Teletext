OL,11,Fopportunity. A total eclipse will
OL,12,Fplunge a narrow path of the United
OL,13,FStates into total darkness later
OL,14,Ftoday, as the moon passes in front of

OL,7,Fthe country, but a much wider band
OL,8,Fwill experience a partial eclipse.
OL,10,FIn fact, everyone in the USA will see
OL,11,Fthe sky darkening. The effect will be
OL,12,Flessened the further you are from the
OL,13,Fband of totality.
OL,15,FThere is celestial certainty that the

OL,9,Fsea birds flocked to land, thinking
OL,10,Fnight had come early and sheep in a
OL,11,Fnearby field similarly followed each
OL,12,Fother towards a farm.
