OL,4,Cfrom April, Ofgem announces

OL,10,Fare higher than the start of 2022.
OL,12,FAnd we now have record energy debt

OL,4,Cfrom April, Ofgem announces
OL,6,FEarlier I spoke to Jonathan Brearley,
OL,7,Fthe head of Ofgem, which sets the
OL,8,Fprice cap. I asked what he is going to
OL,9,Fdo about the huge and unprecedented
OL,10,Flevels of energy debt that have built
OL,11,Fup. He says that "within weeks" a new
OL,12,Finquiry into energy affordability will
OL,13,Fbe started.JIn the detail of the new
OL,14,Fprice cap, two things stand out. From
OL,15,FApril, bill payers will be charged #17
OL,16,Fextra each to help pay off the bills
OL,17,Fof people who haven't been able to pay
OL,18,Fwhat they owe. So in a very direct
OL,19,Fmonetary way, energy debt is the
OL,20,Fproblem of all bill payers.JAlso
OL,21,Fstanding charges are rising again.
OL,22,FThis is the part of your bill that
OL,23,Fstays the same even if you cut your
OL,24,Fenergy useage. Energy officials say
OL,25,Fthey are consulting on possible
OL,26,Fchanges to standing charges.JAt this
