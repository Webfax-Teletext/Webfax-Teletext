OL,7,FAccording to the Woodland Trust, mast
OL,8,Fyears occur roughly every five years
OL,9,Fand refer to years when certain
OL,10,Fspecies of trees and plants produce
OL,11,Flarger than normal crops of nuts and
OL,12,Ffruit.
OL,14,FThe collective term for the fruits and
OL,15,Fnuts produced at this time of year is
OL,16,F"mast," giving rise to the year's name.

OL,7,FOne of the main theories as to why
OL,8,Fplants behave in this way is to
OL,9,Fcontrol the population size of
OL,10,Fpredators and ensure their own
OL,11,Fsurvival.
OL,13,FProducing less mast for several years
OL,14,Fensures predators have less food to

OL,7,FThe sudden boost to fruit and nut
OL,8,Fproduction means far more will be
OL,9,Fproduced than can be eaten by the now
OL,10,Fmuch smaller population size of
OL,11,Fanimals, thus ensuring at least some

OL,7,FScientists are unsure exactly what

OL,11,Ffactors like weather or temperature.
OL,13,FSome scientists also say it can be
