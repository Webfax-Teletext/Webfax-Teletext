OL,6,FAfter a consistently sunny, dry and

OL,8,Ftimely switch into autumn mode as soon
OL,9,Fas we slipped into September.
OL,11,FThe high pressure systems, which we
OL,12,Fkept through much of spring and
OL,13,Fsummer, gave way to low pressure
OL,14,Fsystems bringing blustery winds and
OL,15,Foutbreaks of rain.
OL,17,FIt felt much fresher - temperatures
OL,18,Fdipped a few degrees to nearer average
OL,19,Ffor the time of year - but it felt
OL,20,Fmuch cooler after the consistent heat
OL,21,Fthrough much of the summer.
