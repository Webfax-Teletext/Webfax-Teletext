OL,10,FFrom Monday, June 10, cat owners could

OL,12,Fto microchip their pet.
OL,14,FThe new legislation makes cat
OL,15,Fmicrochipping compulsory in order to
OL,16,Fmake it easier for lost or stray pet
OL,17,Fcats to be reunited with their owners.
OL,19,FThere are more than nine million pet
OL,20,Fcats in England, but as many as 2.3
OL,21,Fmillion of those are unchipped.

OL,6,FThe new law does not apply in Wales,
OL,7,FNorthern Ireland, and Scotland - but
OL,8,Fthere have been calls from animal
OL,9,Fcharities for those nations to follow
OL,10,Fsuit.
OL,12,FOwners should keep a note of their
OL,13,Fcat's microchip number, and those
OL,14,Fwhose cats are already microchipped
OL,15,Fshould ensure their details are up to
OL,16,Fdate.
OL,18,FOnly a trained professional can fit a
OL,19,Fcat's microchip. Owners can ask their
OL,20,Fvet, local council, or rehoming centre
OL,21,Fto microchip their cat.

OL,6,FWhat is microchipping and how much

OL,9,FThe RSPCA says microchipping gives a

OL,11,Fidentified and returned to their owner
OL,12,Fif they get lost or stolen.
OL,14,FUnlike a collar, which can be removed,
OL,15,Fthe microchip is inserted under the
OL,16,Fpet's skin, and gives them a unique
OL,17,Fcode.

OL,6,FCharity Cat's Protection says the
OL,7,Fprocess of microchipping a cat is very
OL,8,Fquick and no more painful than an
OL,9,Finjection. They say there is no need
OL,10,Ffor recovery time after the procedure.
OL,12,FThe microchip, which is about the size
OL,13,Fof a grain of rice, can be scanned and
OL,14,Fmatched to the owner's details, which

OL,21,Fat a reduced rate, or for free.

OL,11,F"As we've seen with dog microchipping,
