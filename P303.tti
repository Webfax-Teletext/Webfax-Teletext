OL,6,FThe public prosecutor's office in
OL,7,FArgentina said three people had been
OL,8,Fcharged, with one person who had been
OL,9,Faccompanying Payne accused of
OL,10,F"abandonment of a person followed by
OL,11,Fdeath" ` which carries a maximum
OL,12,Fsentence of 15 years in prison.
OL,14,FAn employee at the hotel where Payne
OL,15,Fwas staying and a third person have
OL,16,Falso been charged with supplying drugs.
OL,18,FMeanwhile, prosecutors also ruled out
OL,19,Fthird party involvement and "self-
OL,20,Fharm" in Payne's death, according to a
OL,21,Fforensic psychiatric report.

OL,6,F"Although other medical background

OL,8,Fhistory must still be analysed, the
OL,9,Fphenomenon of the lack of defence or
OL,10,Fself-preservation reflex in the fall,
OL,11,Ftogether with other relevant data from
OL,12,Fhis consumption, allow us to conclude
OL,13,Fthat Liam Payne was not fully
