OL,6,FIn her opening statements, prosecutor
OL,7,FErlinda Johnson accused Baldwin of
OL,8,Fplaying "make-believe with a real gun".
OL,10,F"The evidence will show that like in

OL,18,Fit went through quality control tests
OL,19,Fand that before arriving on set, he
OL,20,Frequested to be assigned "the biggest
