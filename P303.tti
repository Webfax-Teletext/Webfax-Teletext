OL,6,FSir Keir Starmer is facing questions
OL,7,Fabout whether his partial U-turn on
OL,8,Flimiting the winter fuel payment can
OL,9,Fbe made in time to help pensioners
OL,10,Fthrough next winter.
OL,12,FThe Prime Minister said on Wednesday
OL,13,Fthat "as the economy improves" he
OL,14,Fwanted to look at widening eligibility
OL,15,Ffor the payments worth up to #300.
OL,17,FSir Keir suggested further details

OL,19,Fto be the next budget in the autumn.
