OL,6,FThe Northern Lights graced the skies
OL,7,Facross parts of the UK on Thursday
OL,8,Fnight, treating those from Sussex to
OL,9,FScotland to a dazzling array of
OL,10,Fcolours.
OL,12,FThe Met Office said sightings of the
OL,13,Flights, also known as aurora borealis,
OL,14,Fwere likely in Scotland and Northern
OL,15,FIreland, and possible in the north of
OL,16,FEngland and the Midlands.
OL,18,FRelatively clear skies were forecast
OL,19,Ffor much of the UK, creating a "decent
OL,20,Fchance of visibility", the weather
OL,21,Fservice said.

OL,6,FA spokesman said there had been "more
OL,7,Fspace weather events in recent
OL,8,Fmonths", including the Northern Lights
OL,9,Fbecause the sun was nearing the peak
OL,10,Fof its solar cycle.
OL,12,FThe Met Office said there was "some
OL,13,Funcertainty" as to when exactly the
OL,14,Fauroras would be visible, but
OL,15,Fskywatchers from across the UK began
OL,16,Fto share pictures of their sightings
OL,17,Fon Thursday evening. There is a chance
OL,18,Fthey could also be visible in the
OL,19,Fearly hours of Friday.
