OL,6,FTo do this they carried out an online

OL,8,Fabout their attitudes, experiences and
OL,9,Ffantasies related to intimacy and
OL,10,Fkissing.
OL,12,FThe participants, who were based in
OL,13,Fthe UK and Italy, rated the qualities
OL,14,Fthey associate with good kissing, and
OL,15,Freflected on their own kissing ability.
OL,17,FThey also reported how often they
OL,18,Fexperience intimate fantasies, and
OL,19,Fprovided information on sexual desire.
