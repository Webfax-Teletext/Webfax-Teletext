OL,6,FFor a sixth night in succession,
OL,7,Fprotestors have vowed to take to the
OL,8,Fstreets of Istanbul tonight in what
OL,9,Fhas become the greatest challenge to
OL,10,Fthe rule of President Erdogan in a

OL,13,FTurkey's long-time leader has
OL,14,Fdismissed the demonstrations as

OL,16,Fsecurity forces, firing tear gas, to
OL,17,Fdisperse them.

OL,9,FEkrem Imamoglu, now languishing in a

OL,12,Fcharges he's called "laughable."

OL,16,Frattled Erdogan by winning power in
