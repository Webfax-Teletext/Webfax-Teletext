OL,7,FGreg Dewhurst, meteorologist at the

OL,9,Fsubtle differences ` I think
OL,10,Fgenerally, England and Wales will see
OL,11,Fless frequent and less heavy showers
OL,12,Fcompared to Sunday, so there should be
OL,13,Fsome longer, drier spells in between.
OL,15,F"But it is worth, if people are
OL,16,Fheading out, having a brolly and
OL,17,Fraincoat as there is a chance almost
OL,18,Fanywhere of having a shower, true for
OL,19,FNorthern Ireland too, actually."
