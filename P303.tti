OL,4,CThe weather for this week
OL,6,FAnd, thanks to high pressure
OL,7,Fdominating across the UK over the next

OL,9,Fweek.
OL,11,FSo, often cloudy but dry over the next
OL,12,Ffew days.
OL,14,FWhat about temperatures?
OL,16,FThis dominating area of high pressure

OL,18,Fthis will keep temperatures on the

OL,4,CThe weather for this week
OL,6,FIt will be the best around 17C which

OL,10,FHow about overnight?
OL,12,FWe can expect some typically autumnal

OL,15,FAny breaks in the cloud will quickly

OL,11,F(also on Thursday).
OL,13,FOne thing to note is that light winds

OL,17,FThe lack of mixing in the air will

OL,19,Fwhich may well linger into the morning.
