OL,6,FSo what exactly happened on Wednesday
OL,7,Fand could Nats cause more problems in

OL,10,FWhat is Nats?
OL,12,FNats - or National Air Traffic
OL,13,FServices - is the organisation that
OL,14,Fprovides air traffic control services
OL,15,Fin the UK.
OL,17,FIt manages aircraft while they are in
OL,18,Fthe air and landing at UK airports.

OL,6,FNats handles more than 2.5 million
OL,7,Fflights and 250 million passengers in
OL,8,Fa typical year, which means that a
OL,9,Ftechnical glitch - even one that is
OL,10,Fshort-lived like on Wednesday - can
OL,11,Fhave a huge impact.
OL,13,FThe organisation also offers its
OL,14,Fservices to certain airports,
OL,15,Fairlines, air traffic service
OL,16,Fproviders and governments outside the
OL,17,FUK across Europe, the Middle East and
OL,18,FAsia, which only increases the knock-
