OL,3,CRobert Prevost: Who is the new Pope
OL,4,CLeo XIV?
OL,6,FRobert Prevost - who will be known as
OL,7,FPope Leo XIV - has been named by the
OL,8,FVatican as the first ever American
OL,9,Fleader of the Catholic Church.
OL,11,FThe 69-year-old, from Chicago, spent
OL,12,Fmany years as a missionary in Peru.
OL,14,FPope Francis brought him to the
OL,15,FVatican in 2023 as the powerful head
OL,16,Fof the office that vets bishop
OL,17,Fnominations, one of the most important
OL,18,Fjobs in the Catholic Church, giving
OL,19,FPrevost a prominence going into the
OL,20,Fconclave that few other cardinals had.

OL,6,FSignificantly, he presided over one of
OL,7,Fthe most revolutionary reforms Francis
OL,8,Fmade, when he added three women to the
OL,9,Fvoting bloc that decides which bishop
OL,10,Fnominations to forward to the pope.
OL,12,FIn early 2025, Francis again showed
OL,13,Fhis esteem by appointing Prevost to
OL,14,Fthe most senior rank of cardinals,
OL,15,Fsuggesting he would at least be
OL,16,FFrancis' choice in any future conclave.

OL,6,FOne strike against him, however, is
OL,7,Fthat he's American, and there has long

OL,9,Fthe geopolitical power already wielded
OL,10,Fby the United States in the secular

OL,13,FBut Prevost, a Chicago native, could
