OL,7,FEngland's chief prosecutor if the
OL,8,Ftrial of two alleged Chinese spies
OL,9,Fcould be resumed if the Government
OL,10,Fdeclares Beijing is a threat to
OL,11,Fnational security.
OL,13,FThe query, in a letter to director of
OL,14,Fpublic prosecutions (DPP) Stephen
OL,15,FParkinson, follows the collapse of the
OL,16,Ftrial of Christopher Cash and
OL,17,FChristopher Berry last month.
