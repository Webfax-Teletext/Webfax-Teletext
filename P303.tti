OL,6,FNo words can truly describe the
OL,7,Fhardships. Many of the memories are
OL,8,Fnow nightmares that will haunt me if I
OL,9,Fsurvive this war.
OL,11,FThere are countless stories I could
OL,12,Fshare, but one that remains with me is
OL,13,Fthat of Mohammed Abu Sahloul, a man I
OL,14,Finterviewed just minutes before he was
OL,15,Fshot by the Israeli army. The memory
OL,16,Fof that moment still haunts me.
OL,18,FIt took me three days to find his
OL,19,Ffamily after the frequent
OL,20,Fdisplacements.

OL,12,FNever-ending challenges
OL,14,FMy family were reluctant to leave,

OL,16,Fmemories. The house wasn't just bricks
OL,17,Fand mortar - it was where my son Ahmed
OL,18,Ftook his first steps, where my

OL,20,Fwhere Noor called me "Baba" for the
OL,21,Ffirst time.

OL,9,FI moved six times in the first four

OL,13,FLogistically, it was nearly impossible

OL,6,FMoving at night was terrifying, and
OL,7,Feven coordinating with medics for
OL,8,Fnight-time coverage was risky, as
OL,9,Fthere were no lights or electricity
OL,10,Fafter 6pm.
OL,12,FSupplies were hard to come by - water,
