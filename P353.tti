OL,6,FThe driver of the 4x4 vehicle was
OL,7,Fcompletely unaware that Denis Ward had
OL,8,Fgone onto the back of his trailer, and
OL,9,Fpolice statements indicate that the

OL,12,Fpeople" making their way back from
OL,13,Ftown up the nearby hill.
OL,15,FIn a closing statement, the coroner
OL,16,Fdescribed the incident as a terrible
OL,17,Floss and noted that as the family
