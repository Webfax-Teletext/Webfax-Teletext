OL,6,FResidents of a Cumbrian village say
OL,7,Fthey're being left 'in the dark' about
OL,8,Fmajor repairs to a footbridge being
OL,9,Fcarried out by National Rail.
OL,11,FThe bridge, which crosses the railway
OL,12,Fto provide pedestrians with access to
OL,13,Feither side of the village, was
OL,14,Finitially closed in April 2024 for
OL,15,Frepairs.
OL,17,FIt was later removed entirely when
OL,18,Fengineers discovered that more
OL,19,Fextensive work was needed to make the
OL,20,Fcrossing safe.

OL,6,FThe railway line runs through the

OL,12,FCurrently, pedestrians are having to
