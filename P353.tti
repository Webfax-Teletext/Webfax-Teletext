OL,6,FToday, Cumbria Police's collisions
OL,7,Finvestigator Steven Wakefield told the
OL,8,Fcourt that he estimated the van to be
OL,9,Ftravelling at around 40mph when it
OL,10,Fleft the road and collided with a tree.
OL,12,FHe added that this is well below the
OL,13,Fnational speed limit of 60, though it
OL,14,Fwas likely close to the maximum speed
OL,15,Frequired to successfully make the bend
OL,16,Fin the road.
OL,18,FHe added that there is evidence of
OL,19,Fimpairment because the driver was
OL,20,Fintoxicated with drugs and alcohol.

OL,6,FPS Wakefield said that the most likely
OL,7,Fcause of the crash was late steering
OL,8,Fthat was inappropriate to the speed of
OL,9,Fthe van due to distraction or
OL,10,Fintoxication.
OL,12,FPC Stevensen told a lawyer for Ryan
OL,13,FDuffy's family that an awareness of
OL,14,Fhim following them could have been a
OL,15,Fsignificant distraction.

OL,19,Ffrom where the vehicle crashed.
