OL,6,FThe couple, who are in their eighties,
OL,7,Ftold ITV Border they must "keep
OL,8,Fthemselves fit for the next seven
OL,9,Fyears" to avoid this outcome.
OL,11,FMr Bell, who was born on the farm,
OL,12,Fsaid: "It will make a serious
OL,13,Fdifference to Graham. It could finish
OL,14,Fhim, he'd have to sell one of the
OL,15,Ffarms at least.
OL,17,F"It's always been a hard job working
OL,18,Fon the farm, working to re-invest in
OL,19,Fbuildings and cattle. But it'll be
OL,20,Feven harder in the future."

OL,16,FAndrew McCornick, a Dumfries beef and
