OL,6,FIn a public meeting of the board,
OL,7,FChief Executive Ralph Roberts admitted
OL,8,FthatJthe level of savings they need to
OL,9,Fmake is unprecedented, and still
OL,10,Fdoesn't go far enough.
OL,12,F"The level of savings that we've
OL,13,Fidentified is twice the amount we've
OL,14,Fever delivered in a year before, and
OL,15,Fthat maybe sets out the scale of the
OL,16,Fchallenge," he said.
OL,18,F"But we're obviously also
OL,19,Facknowledging that doesn't take us far
OL,20,Fenough.

OL,6,F"The savings are coming out across the

OL,8,Fcome out of our workforce, and that
OL,9,Fwill be about looking at the type of
OL,10,Fworkforce we have, reducing things
OL,11,Flike agency spend and overtime,"
OL,12,Fcontinued Ralph Roberts.
OL,14,F"We need to be honest in the NHS, 75%
