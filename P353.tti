OL,9,Ftrying to take it back to a specific
OL,10,Ftime in Scott's life - 1823 - when he
OL,11,Fhad finally, after eight years of
OL,12,Fbuilding work, finished this house,
OL,13,Fand this is the first time he and his
OL,14,Ffamily can actually celebrate
OL,15,FChristmas in their new home.
OL,17,F"We've tried to decorate the house to
OL,18,Freflect the time Scott lived in so
OL,19,Fwe've used lots of natural foliage, a
OL,20,Fsense and smells, to sort of evoke
OL,21,FChristmas and the festive period."
