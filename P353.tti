OL,8,FThe Pollen Season
OL,10,FRunning from March to the end of
OL,11,FSeptember, the pollen season is split
OL,12,Finto three main categories
OL,14,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,15,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,16,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,17,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,18,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,19,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.

OL,5,FThe immune system normally defends the
OL,6,Fbody against harmful invaders, such as
OL,7,Fviruses and bacteria, to ward off
OL,8,Fillnesses.
OL,10,FSome peoples immune system mistakenly
OL,11,Fidentify harmless pollen as a threat
OL,12,Fto the body and tries to fight it by
OL,13,Freleasing a chemical. We call this an
OL,14,Fallergic reaction, which can lead to a

OL,5,FA pollen count is generated by

OL,10,FWhat effect does time of day and

OL,13,FPollen counts tend to be higher in the

OL,15,Falthough they can sometimes be high
OL,16,Fall day long.
OL,18,FIf the grass is damp, the pollen peak

OL,5,FSome grasses release their pollen in
OL,6,Fthe afternoon. Pollen rises in the air
OL,7,Fduring the day and then descends at
OL,8,Fnight, as the air cools.
OL,10,FIn rural areas, the evening peak tends
OL,11,Fto occur between 6pm and 9pm but in
OL,12,Fthe city, where the air stays warmer
OL,13,Ffor longer, the pollen descends later
OL,14,Fand levels tend to peak between 9pm
OL,15,Fand midnight or even later, which is
