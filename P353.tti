OL,7,FA Robert Burns scholar has unearthed
OL,8,Fan early version of one of the poet's
OL,9,Fsongs he believes could have cost him
OL,10,Fhis livelihood had it been published
OL,11,Fbecause of its revolutionary ideas.
OL,13,FThe cancelled working manuscript of
OL,14,Fthe song Ye Jacobites By Name was
OL,15,Fwritten by Burns in 1791 in the early
OL,16,Fyears of the French Revolution,
OL,17,Fagainst which reformers in the British
OL,18,FIsles were also agitating for
OL,19,Fpolitical change at a time when most
OL,20,Fworking people were not permitted to
OL,21,Fvote.

OL,14,F"Black-nebs" was a term used to

OL,16,Fis defined in the Dictionary of Scots
