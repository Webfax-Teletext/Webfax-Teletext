OL,6,FA farm in Lockerbie is embracing new
OL,7,Ftechnology in a bid to future-proof
OL,8,Fthe business for generations to come.
OL,10,FA robotic machine has been installed,
OL,11,Fwhich allows the animals to choose to
OL,12,Fbe milked when they access their feed.
OL,14,FThe equipment has only been there for
OL,15,Fa week, but the local farmer says it
OL,16,Fhas already revolutionised the way
OL,17,Fthey work.

OL,8,F"The cows are settled, they're happy,
OL,9,Fthey are moving around the shed freely
OL,10,Fand their milk has increased quite
OL,11,Fconsiderably in a short space of time
OL,12,F- which we were all really surprised
OL,13,Fabout.
OL,15,F"Switching from conventional to

OL,18,Fwork life balance of the people that
OL,19,Fwork here as well.

OL,6,F"We would be starting the milking
OL,7,Fearly in the morning at around 4am,
OL,8,Fbut now we don't need to start that

OL,10,Fus a great deal of flexibility and it

OL,13,F"My dad isn't into technology or

OL,18,FThe benefits of having an electronic

OL,11,FThe cows all wear collars which send
