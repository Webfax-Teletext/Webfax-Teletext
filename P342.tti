OL,5,FUTV is effectively a hallmark  a
OL,6,Ftrusted brand which brings together the
OL,7,Flocal output.
OL,9,FVisually there is no doubt the channel
OL,10,Fname is ITV 1  trails, idents and the
OL,11,FDOG all highlight the name.
OL,13,FBefore it was just about conceivable
OL,14,Fthe ITV name (left out of local promos)
OL,15,Fwas just the old generic name for the
OL,16,Fnetwork.
OL,18,FBut orally the name is less clear.

OL,5,FBut trails still tend to end with the
OL,6,Fwords "on UTV"  even with the ITV 1
OL,7,Fname on screen.
OL,9,FSimilarly the EPG still refers solely
OL,10,Fto UTV.
OL,12,FITV has always been very hesitant to be

OL,5,FEven if there was a reluctance to
OL,6,Fexplicitly voice the name "ITV 1" on a
OL,7,Flocal trail, there are ways round this.
OL,9,FThe UTV Life trail points the way.
OL,10,FSimply don't say UTV as the channel
OL,11,Fname. Use the brand in other ways.
OL,12,FPerhaps in the title of the programme?
OL,13,FPerhaps by including a more subtle use
OL,14,Fof the name: "Join the UTV news team

OL,5,FIn English regions the name is simply

OL,13,FTake one step back. This risks being
OL,14,Fconfusing to someone with no prior

OL,5,FNeither of these two changes would

OL,7,Fmake the channel name definitive.
OL,9,FThe UTV name appears to have a future

OL,14,FI would be surprised if UTV Live does
