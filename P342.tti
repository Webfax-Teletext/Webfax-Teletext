OL,6,FSo what can we expect next month and
OL,7,Fbeyond, presentation-wise?  Well, as
OL,8,Fwe understand it, no significant
OL,9,Fvisual changes are planned.
OL,11,FThe familiar globe device has been
OL,12,Frecreated at higher quality.  So
OL,13,Fexpect it to be hanging about for a
OL,14,Fwhile yet.
OL,16,FWe will see the phasing out of the
OL,17,Fred patch logo. The now familiar
OL,18,FChameleon-style branding will be
OL,19,Fintroduced, with the BBC blocks at
OL,20,Fthe top of the screen and the 'NEWS'
OL,21,Fbrand positioned at the bottom.
