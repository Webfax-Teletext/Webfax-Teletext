OL,6,GI've often criticised Channel 4 but
OL,7,Gas many will have realised it's tough
OL,8,Glove.
OL,10,FThe remnants of the C4 of old can
OL,11,Fstill shine even when so much of the
OL,12,Fmodern channel is predictable,
OL,13,Fprovocative in a bad way or puerile.
OL,15,FAnd so it's with real pleasure I
OL,16,Foffer praise where praise is due.

OL,6,FVisually they are a treat and their
OL,7,Fvalues speak to what Channel 4 should
OL,8,Freally be about.
OL,10,FThe C4 logo is bold and proud. It's a
OL,11,Flovely touch to see the 1982 colour
OL,12,Fscheme return in some of the
OL,13,Fsequences.

OL,6,FAlthough cleverly executed, they
OL,7,Flacked depth and authority. They
OL,8,Fseemed lightweight and
OL,9,F inconsequential even with some
OL,10,Fheavier stuff awkwardly tacked on.
OL,11,FLike much of modern C4 they seemed
OL,12,Ftrivial ` but you could imagine
OL,13,Fsomeone claiming it was triviality
OL,14,Fwith a purpose.
OL,16,FThe new idents are night and day in
