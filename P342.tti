OL,6,FNow you can see the logic. The spin-
OL,7,Foff programme might appeal to more
OL,8,Fpeople than usual after the final.
OL,10,FAlas, the ratings were still lower
OL,11,Fthan the news would have got. While
OL,12,Fthe ITV News at Ten got a
OL,13,Fsignificantly bigger audience than

OL,6,FThis bizarre scheduling decision has
OL,7,Fhappened before with The Apprentice
OL,8,Ffinal but sends out all the wrong
OL,9,Fsignals.
OL,11,FWe have discussed before how it is
OL,12,Fdifficult for BBC One to run post-
OL,13,Fwatershed programmes ` for instance
OL,14,Fpowerful single dramas ` which are
OL,15,Fmore than 60 minutes long.
OL,17,FThis is why it is acceptable to move
OL,18,Fback the news, for example, on a
OL,19,FSunday or holiday to allow
OL,20,Fexceptional output. At Christmas I

OL,6,FSimilarly if a live football match

OL,9,FBut a spin-off from a programme

OL,12,FWhich might have been a busy news day?
OL,14,FIt is time to nip this in the bud.
OL,16,FThe BBC needs to make a clear
