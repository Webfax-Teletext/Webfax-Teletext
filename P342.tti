OL,6,GThis week marks the 55th anniversary
OL,7,Gof what was probably the single
OL,8,Gbiggest shake up in the history of
OL,9,Gthe ITV network.
OL,11,FIn 1968, all of the big regions
OL,12,Funderwent significant ` sometimes
OL,13,Fdramatic ` changes.
OL,15,FIn London, Thames and London Weekend
OL,16,Fwent on the air for the first time.
OL,18,FIn the north, Yorkshire took control
OL,19,Fof the service east of the Pennines.

OL,7,Fterritory but gained a greater focus,
OL,8,Fserving its Lancashire heartland 7-
OL,9,Fdays-a-week.
OL,11,FMeanwhile ATV started to broadcast 7-

OL,14,FA few weeks earlier Harlech, later to
OL,15,Frebrand as HTV, took over the service

OL,11,FThere were also notable changes to

OL,6,FOutside London, each company was to
OL,7,Fbe the lord and master of its
OL,8,Ffranchise area.
OL,10,FLondon retained two companies in
OL,11,Forder to prevent one from dominating

OL,14,FThe second was a new focus on
OL,15,Fregionalism. The changes were
OL,16,Fexpected to lead to better local
OL,17,Fservices ` a tighter focus on the

OL,6,FAnd thirdly the ITA was making it
OL,7,Fvery clear to the ITV companies that
OL,8,Fthey were tenants ` not owners. They
OL,9,Fcould be dismissed by the regulator.
OL,11,FThe ITA was clear in its belief that
OL,12,FITV could provide just as good a

OL,6,FBut elsewhere what happened?
OL,8,FATV kept on being ATV. Many of its
OL,9,Fbest programmes were still made in
OL,10,FElstree and its commitment to the
OL,11,FMidlands was sometimes queried.
OL,12,FUltimately this led to big changes in
OL,13,F1982.
OL,15,FAnd the early years of London Weekend
OL,16,Fwere nothing short of a disaster. The
OL,17,Fcompany was a commercial disaster and
