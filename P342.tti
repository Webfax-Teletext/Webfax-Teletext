OL,6,GIs a big shake-up in prospect for the
OL,7,GBBC's two main daytime news
OL,8,Gprogrammes?
OL,10,FThe Times on 3rd June reported plans
OL,11,Ffor a revamp of both Breakfast and
OL,12,Fthe News at One.
OL,14,FIt's understood the idea could see
OL,15,FBreakfast extended to 10am and the
OL,16,FNews at One run for an hour.  The
OL,17,FNews at One would be presented from
OL,18,FSalford.
OL,20,FThe BBC has made no comment on the
OL,21,Fstory.

OL,6,FIt is not inevitable that the changes
OL,7,Fwill go ahead.
OL,9,FBoth programmes get the BBC's biggest
OL,10,Fdaytime ratings. Extending them would
OL,11,Falso mean more bespoke UK content on
OL,12,Fthe News Channel. (The Nicky Campbell
OL,13,Fsimulcast has proved controversial.)
OL,15,FWhat isn't clear is how Breakfast
OL,16,Fwould fill an extra hour.
OL,18,FWould it be more of the same? Or
OL,19,Fmight the extra 45 minutes have its
OL,20,Fown character. Perhaps more regular
OL,21,Ffeatures or lighter interviews?

OL,6,FMoving the News at One to Salford
OL,7,Fneed not be an issue for viewers.
OL,8,FBreakfast has proved that a national
OL,9,Fnews programme need not be presented
OL,10,Ffrom London.
OL,12,FIt makes little difference whether a
OL,13,Fpolitician is interviewed by someone
OL,14,Fin London or Salford if they are
OL,15,Fsitting in Millbank. Modern
OL,16,Ftechnology means packages can easily

OL,6,FAssuming that changes do happen
OL,7,Fthere'd be implications for BBC One's
OL,8,Fdaytime schedule.
OL,10,FMorning Live at 9.15am has been
OL,11,Fsuccessful so I'd be surprised if it
OL,12,Fwas dropped. But clearly fewer
OL,13,Fprogrammes would need to be
OL,14,Fcommissioned to cover the morning
OL,15,Fschedule.
OL,17,FIs this a stealth cut or a
OL,18,Fredistribution of resources?
OL,20,FThere'd also need to be a change in
OL,21,Fafternoon commissioning.

OL,6,FExtending the two main news
OL,7,Fprogrammes carries attractions. It
OL,8,Fcould be a cost-effective way to
OL,9,Fbuild on success.
OL,11,FBut tinkering with successful
OL,12,Fprogrammes is always risky.
OL,14,FAnd while, as I have said, there is
OL,15,Fno reason why news programmes cannot
OL,16,Fcome from Salford, it could mean
OL,17,Fdifficult choices for some London
