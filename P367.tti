OL,8,Fthem during dusk. Dusk is the time
OL,9,Fwhere they're most aggressive.
OL,11,F"He ran into the field and the llamas
OL,12,Fwere curious - they're known to be
OL,13,Fguard animals. They went racing
OL,14,Ftowards him, they circled him and once
OL,15,Fthey realised that he was something
OL,16,Fwhich shouldn't be in the field they
OL,17,Fstarted releasing this warning cry,
OL,18,Fwhich is hilarious, it sounds like old

OL,20,Fcan describe it.
