OL,12,F"We kind of harboured sort of strong

OL,16,F"When everyone sticks around and is

OL,6,FThe album topped the UK charts and won

OL,9,FNick said the band needed to leave
OL,10,Ftheir hometown of Sheffield in order
OL,11,Fto get a new perspective when it came
OL,12,Fto songwriting.
OL,14,FHe said: "Jarvis moved down to London
OL,15,Fin the late 80s, and that gives you a
OL,16,Fnew perspective of what it's like
OL,17,Fgrowing up in Sheffield. When you're
OL,18,Fin it, you don't really notice it, but
OL,19,Fwhen you're out of it, you kind of see
OL,20,Fthe difference in Sheffield.

OL,6,F"I think that certainly for the
OL,7,Fprevious album 'His and Hers' and
OL,8,F'Different Class', it was born out
OL,9,Fperhaps of that removal from
OL,10,FSheffield. You could observe the

OL,14,FThis year the band played
