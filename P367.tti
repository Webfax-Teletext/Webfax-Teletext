OL,8,Fsaid: ''I was just brought to my knees
OL,9,Fwhen I knew it was him. It's something
OL,10,Fwe all used to do - but now some of us
OL,11,Fwon't even go to the swimming pool now.
OL,13,F"We lost him at 16, he had his 17th
OL,14,Fbirthday coming up, he had his GCSEs
OL,15,Fcoming up, he had everything else
OL,16,Fahead of him. It just makes you think
OL,17,Fwell that could have been me. Just
OL,18,Fdon't go near the water."

OL,6,FTyler's family unveiled a plaque and
OL,7,Femergency throwline at the site where
OL,8,Fhe drowned over the weekend.
OL,10,FHis granddad Michael Scott said: ''I
OL,11,Fstill don't have the words to describe
OL,12,Fwhat happened. He's in my head when I
OL,13,Fwake up and when I go to bed at night.
OL,14,FI used to play in open water as a kid
OL,15,Fand I regret that now. Just use your
OL,16,Flocal baths. It's not worth it.''
OL,18,FHe's now teamed up with Simon
OL,19,FHaycock's family, whose son Sam also
OL,20,Fdrowned in Ulley reservoir in
OL,21,FRotherham three years ago.

OL,6,FSimon's charity, Sam's Army, has

OL,8,Fthe only one in West Yorkshire.
OL,10,FSimon said: "There's not enough of
OL,11,Fthese throwline stations, there's
OL,12,Floads and loads of open water like
OL,13,Fthis, that hasn't got any equipment

OL,18,FThe Lowland Rescue team were also at
OL,19,Fthe event, to teach Tyler's friends

OL,12,FNickie Arthur, from the Lowland Rescue
OL,13,Fteam said: "To use a throwline, you
OL,14,Ffirst ring 999. Get the throwline bag,
OL,15,Fopen it and throw the line so it lands
OL,16,Fbeyond the casualty. Shout to them to
OL,17,Fget the line, not the bag. Make sure
OL,18,Fthey lie flat the opposite way, so
OL,19,Fwater isn't going in their face, and
OL,20,Fgradually pull them in.''
