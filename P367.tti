OL,6,FSheffield Crown Court heard that

OL,8,Finvestigation and lied to the victim,
OL,9,Ftelling her that a suspect was being
OL,10,Finterviewed when in fact the case had

OL,13,FThe prosecution said the defendant's

OL,16,Fdeteriorate when he began to sign his
OL,17,Fmessages to the victim with a kiss.
