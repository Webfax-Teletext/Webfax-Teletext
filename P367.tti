OL,6,F"One of the worst things I ever heard
OL,7,Fwas that on World Book Day, one child
OL,8,Fbrought an Argos catalogue into school
OL,9,Fbecause that was the only book they
OL,10,Fhad in the house," he said.
OL,12,FThe charity has now launched an appeal
OL,13,Fto raise #6,000 and get the books back
OL,14,Fon the road.
OL,16,F"It is extremely important because we
OL,17,Fcan't drive out to fairs or schools
OL,18,Fand give all our books away because we
OL,19,Fcan't transport them,'' said volunteer
