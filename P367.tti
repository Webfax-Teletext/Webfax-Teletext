OL,6,FA vicar has said vandals who daubed a
OL,7,FSt George's Cross on her church were
OL,8,Ftrying to "intimidate and exclude".
OL,10,FThe symbol - commonly seen as the
OL,11,FEngland flag - was discovered on the
OL,12,Fwall of St John the Baptist Church in
OL,13,FLincoln on Tuesday.
OL,15,FThe Reverend Rachel Heskins said she
OL,16,Fhad "no problem" with the flag.
OL,18,F"I was waving it over the summer with
OL,19,Fthe (England women's football team)
OL,20,Fwinning the Euros. That's not the
OL,21,Fissue," she said.

OL,6,F"I think context is everything and the

OL,8,Fnot the place for it.
OL,10,F"I think it felt like an act of
