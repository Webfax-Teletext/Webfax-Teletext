OL,6,FShe said: "Prior to the legislation
OL,7,Fchanging for XL bullys, bull breed
OL,8,Fdogs were desirable, and the
OL,9,Flikelihood is that these dogs would
OL,10,Fhave made their owners a lot of money
OL,11,Fby being excessively bred but now they
OL,12,Fhave been left to die.
OL,14,F"Animal cruelty will not be tolerated

OL,16,Fwe can to find those responsible and
OL,17,Fput them before the courts."
