OL,10,FHe said: "When the Banksy was removed
OL,11,Fit came with the bridge.
OL,13,F"(It) is two metres high and seven
OL,14,Fmetres wide and weighs over a tonne...
OL,15,FSo there's the main consideration."
OL,17,FCllr Pritchard said that the council

OL,19,Ffor local businesses into account.

OL,8,Fthat the artwork is kept safe.
OL,10,F"Having it in a place where people can
