OL,12,FJohn Piekos, an ex-detective with

OL,15,Fsexual exploitation at a children's
OL,16,Fhome in the city over fears it would
OL,17,Fstir up racial tensions.

OL,11,FMr Piekos, who was working for an anti-

OL,13,Fcollated evidence that gangs of
OL,14,Flargely South Asian men were targeting
OL,15,Fvulnerable teenagers in Bradford.
OL,17,F"After we surveilled this children's

OL,20,Ftook part in a meeting with a number
