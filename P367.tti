OL,6,FMr Justice Poole was told that the
OL,7,Farrangement was "always intended" to
OL,8,Fbe kept secret and resulted in the
OL,9,Fbirth of a now five-year-old boy,
OL,10,Fknown as D.
OL,12,FHowever, after Council was informed
OL,13,Fabout the circumstances of the
OL,14,Fconception in separate proceedings, it
OL,15,Fbrought a legal bid over the parentage
OL,16,Fof the child.
OL,18,FThe council asked the High Court in to
OL,19,Fdirect DNA tests that should be
OL,20,Fcarried out to determine whether the
OL,21,Fman was D's father.
