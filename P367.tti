OL,3,CUniversity apologises after using
OL,4,Ccontroversial autism symbol
OL,6,FThe puzzle piece was designed in the
OL,7,F1960s by Gerald Gasson, a board member
OL,8,Ffor the Autistic Children Association,
OL,9,Fand became adopted as the symbol of
OL,10,Fautism.
OL,12,FHe said people with autism were "full
OL,13,Fof unknowns like puzzle pieces".
OL,15,FBut the symbol later became criticised
OL,16,Fbecause of the perceived implication
OL,17,Fthat people with autism were "missing"
OL,18,Fsomething or "incomplete" and need to
OL,19,Fbe "solved".
