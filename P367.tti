OL,8,Fpatient's eye socket has been
OL,9,Fperformed in Leeds.
OL,11,FMother-of-three Ruvimbo Kaviya had a
OL,12,Fmeningioma removed from the space
OL,13,Flocated beneath the brain and behind
OL,14,Fthe eyes using keyhole surgery.
OL,16,FMany of these types of tumour would
OL,17,Fhave previously been considered
OL,18,Finoperable because of where they are
OL,19,Fsituated and the complexity of the
OL,20,Fsurgery needed.
