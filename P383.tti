OL,6,FA 39-year-old man died from a cardiac
OL,7,Farrest due to "gross failure" and
OL,8,F"neglect" by the ambulance crew sent
OL,9,Fto help him, an inquest has concluded.
OL,11,FCoroner Bridget Dolan says Frazer
OL,12,FIrvine, who lived in Jersey, would
OL,13,Fhave survived if basic care had been
OL,14,Fprovided, such as putting him in the
OL,15,Frecovery position.
OL,17,FShe explains: "The crew did nothing to
OL,18,Fadjust his position to one in which
OL,19,Fhis airway would be protected, despite
OL,20,FFrazer beginning to vomit."
