OL,6,FSt Helier Deputy Max Andrews said:
OL,7,F"The people who decided to respond to
OL,8,Fthe consultation were mostly
OL,9,Fenvironmentalists, so of course they
OL,10,Fwould be very much pro the wind farm.
OL,12,F"Those who were most sceptical, it's
OL,13,Fprobably more to do with the cost. So
OL,14,FI think if we were to take a different
OL,15,Fapproach and ask people down King
OL,16,FStreet, for instance, most people
OL,17,Fwould probably be saying, 'no, we do
OL,18,Fnot want a wind farm'."

OL,13,F"We are keen to investigate all the
