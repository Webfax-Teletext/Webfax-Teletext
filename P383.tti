OL,6,FAlmost 100 people are now looking to
OL,7,Frelocate to Alderney each year,
OL,8,Faccording to one of the island's
OL,9,Fleading estate agents.
OL,11,FIslanders are pointing to political

OL,13,Fprices, and a lack of residency

OL,16,Flooking to move to the island.
OL,18,FAndrew Eggleston, Managing Director of
OL,19,FBell & Co, told ITV News his team is
OL,20,Fcurrently selling an average of 1.5 to
OL,21,Ftwo houses each week.

OL,6,F"We can blame, or thank, the Labour

OL,8,Fexplained.
OL,10,F"There are people who've been thinking

OL,12,Fhappening politically and such over in
OL,13,Fthe UK, they've now decided, 'Okay,

OL,16,FMr Eggelston also believes Alderney is

OL,18,Fdestination for people hoping to
OL,19,Fescape the UK mainland.
