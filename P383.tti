OL,6,FPub tenants in Jersey are calling for
OL,7,Fthe prices they pay for alcohol and
OL,8,Frent to be lowered to help them make
OL,9,Fmoney again.
OL,11,FColin Foster, who owns The Daily Globe
OL,12,Fin St Helier, is closing the pub in
OL,13,FDecember.
OL,15,FHe says the company he rents from,
OL,16,FRandalls Jersey, is charging full
OL,17,Fcommercial rent and makes him pay more
OL,18,Ffor the alcohol he sells when compared
OL,19,Fto traders who are not tied to a
OL,20,Fbrewery.

OL,8,Ftold ITV News that the company used to

OL,13,FSome tied tenants in the UK can buy

OL,17,FColin said: "The pricing structure for

OL,6,FITV News has spoken to a number of

OL,9,Fin the prices being charged, per keg
OL,10,Ffor the same products by Randalls
OL,11,FJersey and the other island pub
OL,12,Fcompany Liberation.
OL,14,FFor example, for a keg of well-known
OL,15,FIrish stout beer, tenanted pubs in
OL,16,FJersey told us they are paying between
OL,17,F#280 and #290. But free houses said
OL,18,Fthey are paying between #165 to #170.
