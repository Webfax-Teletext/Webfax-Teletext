OL,6,FAlthough not involved in the process,
OL,7,FNick Saul who works with DFDS says the
OL,8,Fdelay could cause issues down the line.
OL,10,FHe explains: "It has knock on effects
OL,11,Ffor the bidders and obviously they're
OL,12,Fworking to a final deadline of 1 April
OL,13,Fnext year so the longer the process,
OL,14,Fthe shorter the time they have to
OL,15,Factually get the operation underway."
OL,17,FDr Alf Baird, a former expert advisor
OL,18,Fto the Scottish Government, says the
OL,19,Fcompetition is tough for Condor.
