OL,12,FThe former Bailiff of Jersey and the

OL,14,FBailhache, told ITV News: "We have to
OL,15,Falways look at what is in the interest

OL,18,F"At the moment I think the interests
OL,19,Fof Jersey are served by being in a
OL,20,Frelationship with the United Kingdom
OL,21,Fbut that may not always be the case."

OL,3,CCould Jersey and Guernsey become

OL,6,FFor centuries, the island has been
OL,7,Flinked to the UK via the Monarch.
OL,9,FLike the other Crown Dependencies of
OL,10,Fthe Isle of Man and Guernsey, Jersey
OL,11,Fhas its own government, parliament and
OL,12,Flegal systems.
OL,14,FSir Philip also said the term 'Crown
OL,15,FDependencies' should be retired,
OL,16,Fdescribing it as "imperialistic" and
OL,17,Finstead suggesting 'Crown Territories'.
OL,19,FHe added: "Our autonomy really ought
OL,20,Fto be reflected in the word that is
OL,21,Fused to describe the relationship."

OL,11,FHe explained: "I struggle to find

OL,14,Fwhich has arisen .. .and nobody really
OL,15,Fquite knows the origin.

OL,11,FHe added the government would "need to

OL,14,Fwould only move forward if there was
