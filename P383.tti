OL,6,FA bomb disposal expert says three
OL,7,Funexploded bombs discovered next to a
OL,8,FGuernsey housing development could be
OL,9,Fextremely dangerous to the residents.
OL,11,FThe bombs were discovered on Route
OL,12,FIsabelle, with documented evidence
OL,13,Fthat they were dropped on 3 March 1941.
OL,15,FIn 2019, the States of Guernsey sent a

OL,17,Fwhen the nearby Wellington Close
OL,18,Fhousing development was being built.

OL,8,Fthis was just a shallow non-intrusive

OL,12,FHe explains: "(The bombs) are still

OL,15,Fdispose of them.
