OL,7,FCourt of Appeal ruled that a sentence
OL,8,Fhanded to him in 2024 was "unduly"
OL,9,Flenient.
OL,11,FTerence Michael Tremarco, 62, was
OL,12,Foriginally sentenced to 456 hours of
OL,13,Fcommunity service after he pleaded
OL,14,Fguilty to ten counts of assault on a
OL,15,Fwoman between 1994 and 2000.
OL,17,FIn one instance, Tremarco dragged the
OL,18,Fwoman out of bed by her hair - he also
OL,19,Fkicked and stamped on her.

OL,9,FThe fact that Tremarco had not re-

OL,11,Fin the Court's original sentence.
OL,13,FHowever, during the appeal, Judge

OL,6,FCrown Advocate Luke Sette also argued
