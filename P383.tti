OL,6,FThere are concerns that an iconic goat
OL,7,Fbreed could become extinct in its
OL,8,Fhomeland of Guernsey, unless urgent
OL,9,Faction is taken.
OL,11,FThe island is hosting its first Royal
OL,12,FGolden Goat Symposium this week,
OL,13,Fbringing together local and
OL,14,Finternational experts to discuss what
OL,15,Fcan be done to safeguard the rare
OL,16,Fanimal locally, having been native
OL,17,Fthere for at least 200 years.
OL,19,FPeter Girard, President of The
OL,20,FGuernsey Goat Society, warns: "It's a
OL,21,Fdesperate situation.
