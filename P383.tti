OL,6,FLocal animal charity the GSPCA says
OL,7,Fthe tortoise was likely scooped up by
OL,8,Fa digger, carried in a lorry and then
OL,9,Fpassed through multiple machines -
OL,10,Fincluding a spiked barrel drum, a
OL,11,Fcompactor and a conveyor - before
OL,12,Fbeing dropped from 15 feet.
OL,14,FRemarkably, 'Mayside' only suffered
OL,15,Fsmall superficial wounds to his legs
OL,16,Fand tail, with no damage to his shell.
OL,18,FAndy Norman from the recycling centre
OL,19,Fsays: "It is amazing how the tortoise
OL,20,Fsurvived, but we are really pleased he
