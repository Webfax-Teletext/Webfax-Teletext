OL,6,FFarmer Phil Le Maistre added:
OL,7,F"Fortunately, she seems to be OK but I
OL,8,Fjust can't believe that anyone would
OL,9,Fever think it's acceptable to walk
OL,10,Fpast a field of cows and then try to
OL,11,Fride one like a horse.
OL,13,F"It puts the animals under unwanted
OL,14,Fstress and we've got the vet coming
OL,15,Fout later to check her over.
OL,17,F"I just hope the person realises how
OL,18,Fserious it is, it's beyond me why
OL,19,Fanyone thinks that would be funny."

OL,6,FThe incident was reported to the
OL,7,Fpolice and has been universally
OL,8,Fcondemned online with islanders
OL,9,Fcalling it "disgraceful", "so stupid
OL,10,Fand disrespectful", and "absolutely
OL,11,Fappalling and disgusting behaviour".
OL,13,FPhil explained: "It's been
OL,14,Foverwhelming. Although they're our
OL,15,Fcows, it feels like the whole island
OL,16,Fis protecting them and the community
OL,17,Fsupport has been brilliant."
OL,19,FThe man responsible has now been in
OL,20,Fcontact with them and the police.
