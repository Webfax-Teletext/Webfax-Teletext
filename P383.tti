OL,6,FJersey's Chief Minister says the
OL,7,FGovernment is working to strengthen
OL,8,Foversight of the island's gas company
OL,9,Fwith proposals due to be lodged
OL,10,F"imminently".
OL,12,FDeputy Lyndon Farnham believes the
OL,13,Fcurrent law is "badly out of date" and
OL,14,Fhe has not ruled out regulating Island
OL,15,FEnergy.
OL,17,FSpeaking in the States Assembly, he
OL,18,Fadded: "In certain instances, we can't
OL,19,Feven request information from the gas
