OL,6,FIt's sparked a row about the extent to
OL,7,Fwhich paramedics here in Jersey should
OL,8,Fbe allowed to speak about the
OL,9,Fchallenges of their jobs.
OL,11,FThis is despite the Ambulance Service
OL,12,Flaunching its official Work Without
OL,13,FFear campaign last week which saw
OL,14,Fparamedics speaking out about the
OL,15,Fviolence and aggression they face
OL,16,Fwhile doing their jobs.
OL,18,FHowever, paramedics are now speaking
