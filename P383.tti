OL,6,FGuernsey's Data Protection Authority
OL,7,F(ODPA) has sanctioned First Contact
OL,8,FHealth, after it failed to implement
OL,9,Fsufficient security measures to
OL,10,Fprevent a phishing attack.
OL,12,FThe cybersecurity breach saw
OL,13,Ffraudsters successfully target an

OL,15,Faccess to confidential health data at
OL,16,Fthe physiotherapist.

OL,11,FFirst, multi-factor authentication was

OL,11,FNext, the physiotherapist did not have
