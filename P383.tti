OL,6,FJersey's Health Minister believes the
OL,7,Fway the island's healthcare system is
OL,8,Ffunded may have to change.
OL,10,FThis could mean residents taking out
OL,11,Fprivate insurance or paying more
OL,12,Fcharges as Deputy Tom Binet considers
OL,13,Fwhat needs to be done to meet rising
OL,14,Fdemand amongst an ageing population,
OL,15,Falthough he says any decision would
OL,16,Ffirst need public consultation.
