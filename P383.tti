OL,6,F's government has increased its
OL,7,Ffunding for GP visits by #10.
OL,9,FThis latest reduction brings the
OL,10,Foverall subsidy for face-to-face
OL,11,Fappointments, surgery consultations
OL,12,Fand home visits to #50.28.
OL,14,FThe amount residents currently pay
OL,15,Fafter that subsidy ranges
OL,16,Fconsiderably, between #25 and #51 per
OL,17,Fvisit.
OL,19,FThis is because GP practices on the
OL,20,Fisland are all privately owned so they
OL,21,Fmake the final decision on pricing.

OL,7,FMinister, Deputy Lyndsay Feltham, says

OL,9,Fto reduce their fees from the current

OL,12,FShe adds: "I don't expect them to be
OL,13,Fincreasing their fees in order to
OL,14,Fcompensate for this additional
OL,15,Fincrease in our subsidy.
OL,17,F"I am confident that GPs also want to

OL,10,FDeputy Feltham explains: "We really
