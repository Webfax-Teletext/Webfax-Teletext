OL,6,FOn Wednesday's States sitting, some in

OL,8,Fapologise.
OL,10,FHowever, on Thursday 24 October,

OL,12,Fwhere he described the time taken to
OL,13,Fprocess the complaint as "absurd",
OL,14,Fadding that the code of conduct
OL,15,Fprocess should never have been used in
OL,16,Fthis way.

OL,6,FDeputy St Pier explains:
OL,7,F"Parliamentary privilege is an ancient
OL,8,Fand key principle of parliamentary
OL,9,Fdemocracy. It exists to enable truth
OL,10,Fto be spoken to power without
OL,11,Frepercussion.
OL,13,F"The coverage arising from this case
OL,14,Fin the media and on social media has
OL,15,Fbeen extensive since April 2022. Each
OL,16,Ftime the story is told, more
OL,17,Findividuals have come to me with their
OL,18,Fown families' concerning experiences.
