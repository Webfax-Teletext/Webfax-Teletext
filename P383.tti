OL,6,FHe said: "We haven't actually been
OL,7,Fasked to resolve EVie's insurance
OL,8,Fissue for bikes, we were asked whether
OL,9,Fwe would invest in the business.
OL,11,F"There are other providers, the bus
OL,12,Fservice is a cheap alternative to
OL,13,Fcycles. What we aren't able to do is

OL,18,FDeputy Jehan suggested the company
