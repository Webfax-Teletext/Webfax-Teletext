OL,6,FA growing number of people in Guernsey
OL,7,Fhave raised concerns about the
OL,8,Fincrease in the number of abandoned
OL,9,Fvehicles on the island.
OL,11,FIn one street, alone, there are 8 of
OL,12,Fthem. And most of those are expensive
OL,13,Fcars such as Porsche and Mercedes.
OL,15,FTory Russell who lives in Fermaine
OL,16,FRoad says the last 3 years has seen a
OL,17,Fdramatic rise in the amount of dumped
OL,18,Fcars.

OL,6,F"If we have building works or an

OL,8,Fcame they had to park in the middle of
OL,9,Fthe road. It's an eyesore, it's bad

OL,14,FTory Russell Homeowner said: "Just
OL,15,Fover two years ago the constables of
