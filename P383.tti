OL,6,FA charity leader has criticised
OL,7,Fgovernment for not doing enough to
OL,8,Fsupport local good causes.
OL,10,FThe outgoing Vice President of the
OL,11,FAssociation of Guernsey Charities
OL,12,F(AGC), Peter Rose, announced he was
OL,13,Fstepping down earlier this month after
OL,14,F11 years with the group and wants a
OL,15,Ftax break on donations to help
OL,16,Fgenerate funds.

OL,6,FHe says: "If you put money into it you
OL,7,Fwill reap the benefits. We did a
OL,8,Freview of how effective charitable
OL,9,Fgiving would be if there was gift aid
OL,10,Fand they reckon that the social return
OL,11,Fon investment, the benefit you get
OL,12,Fover and above donations was two and a
OL,13,Fhalf times.
OL,15,F"So you get two and a half the bang
OL,16,Ffor your buck if you gift aid to
OL,17,Fcharities because charities do things
OL,18,Fmore efficiently: they're run by
OL,19,Fvolunteers, whereas government
OL,20,Fpolicies are far more general."

OL,6,FA gift aid scheme is already used in
OL,7,Fthe United Kingdom which means
OL,8,Fcharities and community sports clubs
OL,9,Fcan claim an extra 25p from the
OL,10,Fgovernment for every #1 that is
OL,11,Fdonated.
OL,13,FThere are also calls for more focus on
OL,14,Fbusinesses.
OL,16,FCharity Director Bella Farrell says:
OL,17,F"In a recent Health and Social Care
OL,18,Fsurvey, only 1% of the private sector
OL,19,Fsupported the third sector.

OL,19,Fit has not been looked at this term.
