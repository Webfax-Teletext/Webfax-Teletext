OL,10,FSteve Foote, Chief Executive of the

OL,12,Fto trace his family back to the early

OL,6,FSteve explains: "Guernsey has always
OL,7,Fbeen a bit of a black hole when it
OL,8,Fcomes to researching your family
OL,9,Fonline, so the new records are putting
OL,10,Fthe island on the map as far as online
OL,11,Fgenealogy goes.
OL,13,F"Some of the earliest parish registers
OL,14,Fgo back to the 1500s, and the quality
OL,15,Fof the scans they've done is really
OL,16,Fgood.
