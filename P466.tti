OL,7,Fcareful about the dog breeders they
OL,8,Fuse after going through the
OL,9,F'traumatising' experience of having to
OL,10,Fput down her brand-new puppy after

OL,13,FWendy Jones, from Conwy, bought a
OL,14,Fpuppy in 2021 from what she believed
OL,15,Fto be a reputable private seller who
OL,16,Fappeared to have all the correct
