OL,7,FA HGV lorry depot that "can't house
OL,8,Ftrucks" is costing Conwy taxpayers
OL,9,Fnearly a quarter of a million pounds
OL,10,Fper year.
OL,12,FThe council had intended to use the
OL,13,Fdepot to store its fleet of vehicles
OL,14,Fbut the flooring is not strong enough
OL,15,Fto hold heavy goods vehicles.
OL,17,FIt is now locked into a contract which
OL,18,Fsees them spend #240,000 a year in
OL,19,Frent for the building at Mochdre
OL,20,FCommerce Park.
