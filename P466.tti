OL,7,FMorris said: "The failure to identify
OL,8,FMrs K's gallstones in January 2021 was
OL,9,Fan unacceptable service failure which
OL,10,Fcaused Mrs K and her family a
OL,11,Fcontinued and grave injustice.
OL,13,F"I am saddened to conclude that, had
OL,14,FMrs K been treated appropriately at
OL,15,Fthe outset, her acute pancreatitis
OL,16,Fwould have been treated successfully
