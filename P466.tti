OL,6,FThe college opened its doors in 1927
OL,7,Fand offered students from Wales and
OL,8,Faround the world something priceless
OL,9,Fand precious: access to higher
OL,10,Feducation without having to pay.
OL,12,FThe centrepiece of Coleg Harlech was a
OL,13,Fgrand Georgian building that was once
OL,14,Fthe holiday home of an eccentric
OL,15,Fmillionaire.
OL,17,FIt became well known as a "second

OL,19,Fhad previously been unable to further
OL,20,Ftheir education for economic or social
OL,21,Freasons.

OL,6,FSheila Maxwell is a former bursar at
OL,7,FColeg Harlech. "The students just knew
OL,8,Fthat there was more in them and they
OL,9,Fwanted to do something for themselves.
OL,10,FSo, a milkman from Wrexham could
OL,11,Fbecome a professor of economics.
OL,13,F"It was like a door that was ajar, and
OL,14,Fas you came to the college you widened
OL,15,Fthat doorway out into a full
OL,16,Feducation."
OL,18,FBut running a residential college was
OL,19,Fexpensive, and as the years went on
OL,20,Fthose costs began to soar.
