OL,6,FSpeaking to the PA news agency, the
OL,7,Ffamily friend said: "The fact is that
OL,8,Fon the night in question, she (Rachel
OL,9,FEvans, Mr Evans' wife) was pretty much
OL,10,Fleft to her own devices, support
OL,11,Fwasn't adequately provided at the
OL,12,Ftime."
OL,14,FOn October 22 the force put out a
OL,15,Fstatement saying, "the deceased's next
OL,16,Fof kin have been informed and his
OL,17,Ffamily are being supported by
OL,18,Fspecialist officers".
OL,20,FBut a specialist officer from the BTP
OL,21,Fvisited the family only on October 23.

OL,6,FInvestigators from the Rail Accident
OL,7,FInvestigation Branch (RAIB) suspected
OL,8,Fthe incident was caused by slippery

OL,11,FThe RAIB has said the condition of the

OL,13,Fpoint meant "adhesion" between wheels
OL,14,Fand rails was "relatively low".
OL,16,FIt said this suggested an Aberystwyth-
OL,17,Fbound train may have slid while

OL,20,Fstationary train destined for
