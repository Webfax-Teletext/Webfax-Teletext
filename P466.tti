OL,6,FAlthough there is some limited use of

OL,8,Fservice in Wales, successive Welsh
OL,9,FLabour governments have generally been
OL,10,Fvocally opposed to it, going as far as
OL,11,Fpromising in the 2011 manifesto to
OL,12,F"eliminate the use of private sector

OL,15,FThe UK Health Secretary, Wes
