OL,6,FThe debate over assisted dying reaches
OL,7,Fa crucial stage today (Friday 20 June).
OL,9,FA historic vote will take place: it
OL,10,Fwill either effectively legalise it or
OL,11,Freject the proposal for the
OL,12,Fforeseeable future but there is still
OL,13,Fa huge question about what will happen
OL,14,Fhere in Wales.
OL,16,FToday's debate and vote on the
OL,17,FTerminally Ill Adults (End of Life)
OL,18,FBill is at the stage known as Third

OL,10,FIf they vote for it, it will move to

OL,6,FIn October 2024, MSs including the

OL,9,Fagainst a motion backing the principle

OL,12,Fsuggests that they would vote against

OL,15,FAll of this means that in theory,
OL,16,Fassisted dying could be made legal but
OL,17,Feffectively banned in Wales. All eyes
