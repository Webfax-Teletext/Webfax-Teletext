OL,6,FMoving into your first home can be a
OL,7,Fbusy time, especially if the place
OL,8,Fneeds a bit of sprucing up.
OL,10,FBut Kirsten Markham got a bit more
OL,11,Fthan she bargained for from her house
OL,12,Fin Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, when she
OL,13,Fdiscovered it was actually a former
OL,14,Fabbey.
OL,16,FThe 23-year-old realised something was
OL,17,Fup when she started renovations at the
OL,18,Fempty property in the town,
OL,19,Fappropriately located on Abbey Street.

OL,6,F"I started uncovering amazing

OL,8,Fsaid.J"So that's when the journey
OL,9,Fbegan. It was amazing to discover a
OL,10,Fhouse with a story."
OL,12,FThings took an unexpected turn when a
OL,13,Fneighbour suggested the terraced house
OL,14,Fmight once have served a religious
OL,15,Fpurpose.
OL,17,F"The neighbour came over and started

OL,6,F"The first thing people would say was
OL,7,Fit was an abbey, but I couldn't find a
OL,8,Flot of history on the house and the
OL,9,Fstreet itself. So it's very hard to to
OL,10,Fsort of determine what it actually was.
OL,12,F"But now the house is fully stripped,
OL,13,Fyou can see all of the lovely old
OL,14,Ffeatures and the history."
OL,16,FKeith Evans, of the Kidwelly History

OL,6,F"We think this site would have been

OL,8,Fby the church for growing crops,
OL,9,Fsheep, having cattle and dairy," he
OL,10,Fsaid.
OL,12,F"And then over the centuries, from

OL,15,Fthis would have gone up with different
