OL,8,Fwhat was formerly the Brecon and

OL,10,Fedges now stretching east towards
OL,11,FPontardawe to take in what was part of
OL,12,Fthe former Neath boundary.
OL,14,FThese changes mean it is hard to
OL,15,Fcompare predictions for this year's
OL,16,Felection with the 2019 result.
OL,18,FHowever, recent polls suggest the

OL,20,Fwith the Liberal Democrats for this
OL,21,Fseat on 4 July.
