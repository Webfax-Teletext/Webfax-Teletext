OL,11,FJulie Rees, from Carmarthen Coracle
OL,12,Fand Netsmen's Association, explains
OL,13,F"When the Romans invaded, they saw
OL,14,Fthese quirky little boats on the river.
OL,16,F"Back then they were used for
OL,17,Ftransportation, today they're
OL,18,Fpredominantly used for fishing.
