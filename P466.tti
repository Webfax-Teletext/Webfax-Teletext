OL,6,FThe Welsh Rugby Union has denied
OL,7,Fallegations that sexism was at the
OL,8,Fheart of the recent contract dispute
OL,9,Fwith its women's squad.
OL,11,FOver the summer, negotiations between
OL,12,Fthe players and the Union became
OL,13,Ffractious and descended into chaos.
OL,15,FPlayers were set a three-hour deadline
OL,16,Fto sign contracts as frustrations on
OL,17,Fall sides grew.
