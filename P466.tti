OL,6,FGerallt has been teaching self-defence
OL,7,Fsessions for 20 years. According to
OL,8,Fhim, there are several reasons why
OL,9,Fpeople carry a knife.
OL,11,F"There are two clear mentalities,
OL,12,Fthere is a mentality that I want to
OL,13,Fkeep myself safe and there is a
OL,14,Fmentality that I am going to target
OL,15,Fsomeone else. The problem is that
OL,16,Fkeeping knives to keep yourself safe
OL,17,Fis a danger to yourself and it's a
OL,18,Fdanger to the other person."
