OL,6,FA council has issued a warning to car
OL,7,Fpark users following a scam using fake
OL,8,FQR codes at car parks in south Wales.
OL,10,FThe fake QR codes, which lead users to
OL,11,Ffraudulent websites, have been found
OL,12,Fat car parks in the Bridgend area, the
OL,13,Flocal council has said.
OL,15,F"These codes mislead you to
OL,16,FPaybyPhonie.com, a scam page mimicking
OL,17,Fthe legitimate PaybyPhone service,"
OL,18,Fthe council said in a statement on
OL,19,Fsocial media.
