OL,11,FBut, for Warren Gatland, this year's
OL,12,Ftournament might provide little
OL,13,Freprieve from the greyness that seems
OL,14,Fto cover Wales as winter turns to

OL,17,FThis year, even the most passionate of

OL,11,Fthe match but by Friday morning, they
OL,12,Fhad reversed their decision.
