OL,6,FCardiff's Queen Street has claimed the
OL,7,Ftop spot in a list of the best high
OL,8,Fstreets in the UK, but not everyone is
OL,9,Fconvinced.
OL,11,FAmerican Express measured things like
OL,12,Fthe variety of shops, availability of
OL,13,Fparking, and how close the nearest
OL,14,Ftrain station was.
OL,16,FBut some in the Welsh capital were
OL,17,Fsurprised by the accolade, believing
OL,18,Fthe nearby St Mary Street or The Hayes
OL,19,Fin the capital to offer a better high
OL,20,Fstreet experience.
