OL,5,GThe director-general of the BBC Tim
OL,6,GDavie has said that whilst it's
OL,7,G"obviously sad" that three
OL,8,Glong-standing news presenters have
OL,9,Gopted to depart the organisation the
OL,10,Gcurrent level of "management
OL,11,Ginefficiency" needs to be addressed.
OL,13,FYesterday, Deadline reported that BBC
OL,14,FNews presenters David Eades, Joanna
OL,15,FGosling and Tim Willcox have opted to
OL,16,Ftake voluntary redundancy.

OL,5,FThe news came as the BBC continues the
OL,6,Fphased implementation of a merger of
OL,7,Fits international and domestic TV news
OL,8,Fchannels. The official start date for
OL,9,Fthe new channel is believed to be some
OL,10,Ftime in April, though the on-air launch
OL,11,Fis expected to be low-key.
OL,13,FIn July, the BBC announced plans to
OL,14,Fmerge the two TV news channels, as part
OL,15,Fof its new digital-first strategy. Over
OL,16,F70 posts are believed to face the axe
OL,17,Fas a result.

OL,5,FDavie told the Public Accounts
OL,6,FCommittee: "There is a degree of
OL,7,Fmanagement inefficiency, in my view,
OL,8,Fand it is not right, and no one in the
OL,9,Fworld is running completely separate
OL,10,Foperations in this way.
OL,12,F"Now linked to that, I think that it is
OL,13,Fobviously sad when people decide to
OL,14,Ftake VR and leave, but you need less
OL,15,Fpresenters and I think that is
OL,16,Fappropriate.

OL,9,Fso-called churn in the newsroom is very

OL,14,Fthat gives opportunities and allows

OL,5,FMr Davie said he not believe the BBC
OL,6,Fneeded "two completely separate
OL,7,Foperations" and that their merger plans
OL,8,Fweren't just about "digital evangelism"
OL,9,Fbut "based on where the audience is".
OL,11,FHe added: "We don't think it is
OL,12,Fefficient. We think it is absolutely
OL,13,Fappropriate to make the changes to
OL,14,Fclose the independent operations and
OL,15,Frun it as a more integrated operation.
OL,16,FThat does not mean the channel is the
