OL,6,GIs a big shake-up in prospect for the
OL,7,GBBC's two main daytime news
OL,8,Gprogrammes?
OL,10,FThe Times on 3rd June reported plans
OL,11,Ffor a revamp of both Breakfast and
OL,12,Fthe News at One.
OL,14,FIt's understood the idea could see
OL,15,FBreakfast extended to 10am and the
OL,16,FNews at One run for an hour.  The
OL,17,FNews at One would be presented from
OL,18,FSalford.
OL,20,FThe BBC has made no comment on the
OL,21,Fstory.

OL,6,FIt is not inevitable that the changes
OL,7,Fwill go ahead.
OL,9,FBoth programmes get the BBC's biggest
OL,10,Fdaytime ratings. Extending them would
OL,11,Falso mean more bespoke UK content on
OL,12,Fthe News Channel. (The Nicky Campbell
OL,13,Fsimulcast has proved controversial.)
OL,15,FWhat isn't clear is how Breakfast
OL,16,Fwould fill an extra hour.
OL,18,FWould it be more of the same? Or
OL,19,Fmight the extra 45 minutes have its
OL,20,Fown character. Perhaps more regular
OL,21,Ffeatures or lighter interviews?

OL,6,FMoving the News at One to Salford
OL,7,Fneed not be an issue for viewers.
OL,8,FBreakfast has proved that a national

OL,12,FBut how would the extra time be

OL,6,FMorning Live at 9.15am has been
OL,7,Fsuccessful so I'd be surprised if it
OL,8,Fwas dropped. But clearly fewer
OL,9,Fprogrammes would need to be
OL,10,Fcommissioned to cover the morning
OL,11,Fschedule.
OL,13,FIs this a stealth cut or a
OL,14,Fredistribution of resources?
OL,16,FThere'd also need to be a change in
OL,17,Fafternoon commissioning.

OL,21,Fcould be a cost-effective way to
