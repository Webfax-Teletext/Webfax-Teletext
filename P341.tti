OL,6,GThere was a little surprise for viewers
OL,7,Gduring BBC Breakfast this morning. The
OL,8,Gregional news bulletin at 7.55am has
OL,9,Gbeen reinstated without much of a
OL,10,Gfanfare.
OL,12,FAlthough this bulletin is shorter than
OL,13,Fthe others, it effectively means that
OL,14,Fthe regional news provision during the
OL,15,Fprogramme is now back to where it was
OL,16,Fbefore the pandemic.
OL,18,FThe early morning regional news service
OL,19,Fhas had something of a bumpy ride over
OL,20,Fthe past three years.

OL,6,FIn the dark days of March 2020 it was
OL,7,Fdropped completely. Opts in the nations
OL,8,Fresumed as restrictions eased before
OL,9,Fearly morning bulletins returned to the
OL,10,FEnglish regions ` though there were
OL,11,Flater occasions when English opts had
OL,12,Fto be dropped again.
OL,14,FIn the English regions there have also
OL,15,Fbeen a number of occasions when
OL,16,Fneighbouring services have been merged
OL,17,F` often though not always as a result
OL,18,Fof Covid-related absences.
OL,20,FBut with life now normal again, it
OL,21,Fseems right to be offering a full
OL,22,Fservice.

OL,6,FThere is an important question though
OL,7,Fabout the amount of repetition within
OL,8,Fthe bulletins. Each half-hourly
OL,9,Fbulletin can seem very similar in the
OL,10,Fabsence of a developing story.
OL,12,FIt might seem a chore to see the same
OL,13,Fthing twice. The onus should be on the
OL,14,Fpresenter and journalist outputting the
OL,15,Fopts to freshen up scripts as the
OL,16,Fmorning progresses.
OL,18,FIt's thought a typical Breakfast viewer
OL,19,Fsees between 30 and 40 minutes of the
OL,20,Fprogramme so there was a logic in
OL,21,Fdropping one of the bulletins.

OL,6,FBut on the other hand the programme's
OL,7,Faudience peaks around 8am. The loss of
OL,8,Fthe 7.55am bulletin was significant to
OL,9,Fthe nations and regions. Hopefully the

OL,6,FThe service is much more comprehensive
