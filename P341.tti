OL,6,FLast week we noted the temporary      
OL,7,Fincrease in advertising on the three  
OL,8,Fmain commercial channels.             
OL,10,FITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 all lost 
OL,11,Fsome advertising time following the   
OL,12,Fdeath of HM The Queen and during the  
OL,13,Fperiod of mourning.                   
OL,15,FWith Ofcom's approval they can now make
OL,16,Fup some of the "lost minutes" by      
OL,17,Frunning more adverts than normal.     
OL,19,FThe big rule is that they still cannot
OL,20,Fhave more than 12 minutes in a clock  
OL,21,Fhour.

OL,12,FWe looked carefully at advertising    
OL,13,Fbetween 5pm and 12am on ITV between   
OL,14,FFriday and Sunday.

OL,6,FThe 6pm hour contained two breaks  one
OL,7,Fof 4 minutes between the regional and 
OL,8,Fnational news and one of 3 minutes 30 
OL,9,Fseconds at approximately 6.45pm.      
OL,11,FIf a full 12 minutes were to be allowed
OL,12,Fin each hour, the likelihood is that 2
OL,13,Fmore breaks would be included totalling
OL,14,F4 minutes and 30 seconds.             
OL,16,FIn the 10pm hour, there was 8 minutes 
OL,17,Fof advertising  4 minutes before News
OL,18,Fat Ten and 4 minutes after the regional

OL,6,FIt should be noted that internal breaks
OL,7,Fcan normally only include 3 minutes 30

OL,12,FThere was one "trail break" at around

OL,6,FBetween 5pm and 12am there was almost 
OL,7,Fas much advertising as would be       
OL,8,Fallowable after any potential increase.
OL,10,FThe 6pm hour fell slightly short by 30

OL,6,FThere is also the question of whether

OL,10,Fpromotions  some promo time has been
