OL,5,FAfter a few days based in a temporary 
OL,6,FCSO set, tonight's edition of An La saw
OL,7,Fthe programme return to an updated    
OL,8,Fversion of its main set.              
OL,10,FThe back panels of the set previously 
OL,11,Fincluded one large TV screen and two  
OL,12,Ffixed images. The panels have now been
OL,13,Fentirely replaced  but look very     
OL,14,Fsimilar to what went before. A key    
OL,15,Fdifference is that we now have three  
OL,16,Flarge TV screens within the panels,   
OL,17,Fwith the ability to display images sent
OL,18,Fthrough from the gallery.             
OL,20,FThe oval/rectangle desk has been      
OL,21,Freplaced with a smaller circular desk.

OL,5,FThe programme's theme tune has also   
OL,6,Fundergone a minor update.             
OL,8,FThe BBC's Northern Irish radio stations
OL,9,Fhave this evening switched to the new 
OL,10,FChameleon branding across their social
OL,11,Fmedia accounts.                       
OL,13,FBBC Radio Ulster moved first, earlier 
OL,14,Fthis evening. BBC Radio Foyle followed
OL,15,Flater, after 9pm.                     
OL,17,FFoyle's large profile images seem to be
OL,18,Fout-of-step with the Chameleon branding
OL,19,Fused for Ulster. Hopefully just a     
OL,20,Ftemporary blip.
