OL,6,FDenise Turton's story is so completely
OL,7,Fdevastating, that the first time she
OL,8,Ftold it to me I was lost for words.
OL,10,FEven though a camera was filming our
OL,11,Finterview, I couldn't think of what to
OL,12,Fsay next.
OL,14,FHere is the short version.

OL,6,FWhen he was two years old, Lee was
OL,7,Fgiven a blood product called 'Factor
OL,8,F8'. The batch Lee was treated with was
OL,9,Finfected with HIV.
OL,11,FAround the time he turned seven Lee
OL,12,Fstarted to get ill. He had trouble
OL,13,Fhearing, some days he couldn't see,
OL,14,Fothers he had so many ulcers in his
OL,15,Fthroat that he couldn't eat.
OL,17,FHe had AIDS.
OL,19,FDenise said it was awful to watch:
OL,20,F"You watch your child just
OL,21,Fdisappearing before your eyes."

OL,6,FThere was such a in the 1980s that the
OL,7,Ffamily had to move to a different part
OL,8,Fof the country where they weren't
OL,9,Fknown.
OL,11,FWhen Lee was eight years old he asked
OL,12,FDenise what was going to happen to
OL,13,Fhim, "He asked in the end. He asked:
OL,14,F'Am I going to die?'"
OL,16,FDenise was honest: "I did say 'I'm not
OL,17,Fsure,' but I did say 'most probably
OL,18,F... we don't know.'"
OL,20,FLee died in January 1992 - he was ten.
