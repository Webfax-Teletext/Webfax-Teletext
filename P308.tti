OL,6,FITV News Midlands Correspondent Stacey
OL,7,FFoster went to meet Lars, the baby
OL,8,Freindeer, who was raised in a house in
OL,9,FNorthamptonshire
OL,11,FTraditionally, reindeer spend their
OL,12,Fdays in chilly fields. A select few
OL,13,Fmight even get the chance to wait
OL,14,Foutside houses on Christmas Eve.
OL,16,FBut seven-month-old Lars, a calf, born
OL,17,Fin a stable in Northamptonshire in
OL,18,FMay, isn't the outdoors type.

OL,4,Cwho now thinks he's a dog
OL,6,FAt three days old, his owner made the
OL,7,Fdifficult decision to remove him from
OL,8,Fhis mother and take him inside the
OL,9,Ffamily home because he was not feeding.
OL,11,FHis mother did not have a sufficient
OL,12,Fmilk supply, and despite medical
OL,13,Fintervention, she started to become
OL,14,Fdisinterested in raising her newborn
OL,15,Fson.
OL,17,FInside the living room of the warm
OL,18,Ffarmhouse, a Christmas miracle was in
OL,19,Fthe making.

OL,10,FAngie Nelson, who runs Real Reindeer

OL,14,F"The key was the love... and I needed
OL,15,Fto give him that. There was no point
OL,16,Fhaving him out in the stable going out
OL,17,Fevery two hours to see him. He needed
OL,18,Fto be part of a family."
