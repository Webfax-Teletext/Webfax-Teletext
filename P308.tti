OL,6,FThen late last week, Channel 4's
OL,7,Fundercover filming apparently showed

OL,11,F4 has stuck by its story.
OL,13,FAnd to cap it all off, on Sunday a
OL,14,FReform UK candidate announced he was
OL,15,Fdefecting from the party to back the
OL,16,FConservatives citing "a significant

OL,6,FITV News has contacted the party for a

OL,9,FFarage admitted to me earlier today
OL,10,Fthat it had been a "tough" period but

OL,13,F"I'm actually quite bullish for what

OL,15,F"do you know what we're going to

OL,18,FI asked him why so many people who
