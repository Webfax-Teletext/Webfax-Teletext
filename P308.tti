OL,4,Cciting surplus of new jabs
OL,6,Fhas begun a worldwide withdrawal of
OL,7,Fits vaccine due to a surplus of other
OL,8,Foptions targeted at new variants.
OL,10,FThe announcement comes months after
OL,11,Fthe British-Swedish drugmaker
OL,12,Fvoluntarily withdrew its EU marketing
OL,13,Fauthorisation for the vaccine, branded
OL,14,FVaxzevria, amid increased scrutiny
OL,15,Fover blood clots that could be caused
OL,16,Fby its jab.
OL,18,FAstraZeneca said: "As multiple variant
OL,19,FCovid-19 vaccines have since been
OL,20,Fdeveloped there's a surplus of
OL,21,Favailable updated vaccines."

OL,6,FThe company said the drug was no

OL,9,FAlthough the vaccine was found to be
OL,10,Fsafe by countries across the world, it
OL,11,Fcarried the risk of extremely rare

OL,13,FThrombocytopenia Syndrome, which

OL,16,FStudies estimate around two-three
