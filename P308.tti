OL,6,FThe Scottish city of Aberdeen has long
OL,7,Fbeen known as the oil capital of
OL,8,FEurope after reserves were first
OL,9,Fdiscovered off the North Sea just over
OL,10,Ffive decades ago.
OL,12,FBut now, the once bustling main
OL,13,Fshopping area, Union Street, is
OL,14,Flittered with empty units.
OL,16,FThe downturn in oil has led to a

OL,14,Fknow that the oil and gas industry is
OL,15,Fdecreasing and declining, but it also
OL,16,Fcan't go off a cliff edge because if
OL,17,Fit does, then you've got this big gap
