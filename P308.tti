OL,15,Finto Mahathir and his sons - an

OL,7,F"The problem is that the present

OL,10,Fthey cannot find an excuse."
OL,12,F"They still couldn't prove that I've

OL,7,FWhen asked if he was worried about
OL,8,Fgoing to prison at his ripe age,
OL,9,FMahathir concedes he is, but, ever the
OL,10,Fpolitician, he pivots: "my worry is
OL,11,Fmainly about my own people, my own
OL,12,Frace."
OL,14,F"I am a Malay," he added, "This is my

OL,13,F"I don't care about that," he said
