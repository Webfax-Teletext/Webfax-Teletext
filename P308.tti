OL,6,FKeir Starmer has said there will be a
OL,7,Fcast-iron commitment to spending 2.5%
OL,8,Fof GDP on defence, as he heads to the
OL,9,F75th NATO summit in Washington DC.
OL,11,FThe new prime minister said defending
OL,12,Fthe country from multiple threats was
OL,13,Fthe number one priority for him.
OL,15,FHowever, he has yet to set out how he
OL,16,Fwill fund the defence pledge, or when
OL,17,Fit will be delivered, saying a
OL,18,Fstrategic defence review to be
OL,19,Flaunched next week must come first.

OL,10,F"At a time when we face multiple
