OL,3,CWhy an interest rate cut isn't likely

OL,6,FIn forecasting terms, that's quite a

OL,8,Fdecided there's little to no prospect
OL,9,Fof an interest rate cut on Thursday
OL,10,Fand that it is likely to be November
OL,11,Fbefore the Bank decides it's time to
OL,12,Flower the cost of borrowing.
OL,14,FQuite why services inflation is
OL,15,Fproving so persistent isn't clear,
OL,16,Falthough the hike on the National
OL,17,FLiving Wage (the government increased
OL,18,Fit by 9.8% in April) may be a factor.
