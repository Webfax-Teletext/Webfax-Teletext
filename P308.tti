OL,6,FWar or peace? This week the Middle

OL,8,Fcloser to one or the other.
OL,10,FThat neither Iran nor Hezbollah have
OL,11,Fretaliated almost a fortnight since
OL,12,Fthe assassinations in Tehran and
OL,13,FBeirut is a positive sign.
OL,15,FThe passage of time quells anger and
OL,16,Fallows defences to be put in place.
OL,17,FAnd defences are absolutely critical.

OL,8,Fdeath and destruction is wrought in
OL,9,FIsrael, and the effectiveness of
OL,10,Fdefensive measures - as well as the
