OL,9,FDear Rishi,
OL,11,FI am writing to let you know that,
OL,12,Fafter deep reflection and much heart-
OL,13,Fsearching, I have decided, in all
OL,14,Fprofessional conscience, that I can no
OL,15,Flonger continue as a member of the

OL,6,FAs you know, alongside my work as an
OL,7,FMP for the past 14 years, I have
OL,8,Falways worked as an NHS hospital
OL,9,Fdoctor. Throughout the ongoing junior
OL,10,Fdoctors strike, I have spent more than
OL,11,Ftwenty night-shifts, over the last
OL,12,Fyear or so, working as a mental health
OL,13,Fdoctor in a busy Hospital A&E
OL,14,FDepartment. It has been a truly life
OL,15,Fchanging experience. Working on the
OL,16,Ffront line of a health service under
OL,17,Fimpossible strain has left me, at
OL,18,Ftimes, struggling to look my NHS
OL,19,Fcolleagues, my patients and my
OL,20,Fconstituents in the eye.
