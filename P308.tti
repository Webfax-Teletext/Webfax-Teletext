OL,6,FTrump sought to follow through on his
OL,7,Fcampaign promises to end the war
OL,8,Fquickly. But his approach towards
OL,9,FRussia and Putin has alarmed many in
OL,10,FEurope as being too conciliatory.
OL,12,FRussia's foreign ministry said on
OL,13,FSaturday that preparations for a face-
OL,14,Fto-face meeting between Trump and
OL,15,FPutin were underway, and that US
OL,16,Fofficials had acknowledged that they
OL,17,Fhad agreed with Moscow to re-establish
OL,18,Fdiplomatic ties.

OL,7,FSergey Lavrov said President Putin has
OL,8,Fmade it clear that Russia is "ready to
OL,9,Fnegotiate with both Ukraine and

OL,18,Fthis background, the position of the
