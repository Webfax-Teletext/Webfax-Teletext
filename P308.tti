OL,6,FWhat is AMOC?
OL,8,FThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning
OL,9,FCirculation (AMOC) is a large system
OL,10,Fof ocean currents, like a conveyor
OL,11,Fbelt, that circulates water within the
OL,12,FAtlantic Ocean.
OL,14,FIt is driven by differences in
OL,15,Ftemperature and salt content - the
OL,16,Fwater's density - and is critical in
OL,17,Fregulating the climate in Europe.

OL,6,FThe mild winters experienced in the UK
OL,7,Fand north-western Europe are partly
OL,8,Fdue to the AMOC bringing warm water
OL,9,Fnorth and cold water south.
OL,11,FThese currents explain why the weather
OL,12,Fin this country is milder than you'd
OL,13,Fexpect. In terms of latitude, we are
OL,14,Fas far north as Canada and yet our
OL,15,Fwinters aren't as cold.
OL,17,FThis is because we are blanketed in
OL,18,Fwarmer water, which started in the
OL,19,FCaribbean and headed towards us in the
OL,20,FGulf Stream - an important part of the
OL,21,FAMOC system.
