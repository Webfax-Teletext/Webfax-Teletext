OL,6,FIn the first months of the Covid-19
OL,7,Fpandemic, the UK was terribly
OL,8,Funprepared.
OL,10,FDoctors and nurses were reduced to
OL,11,Fusing bin bags in place of what should
OL,12,Fhave been proper personal protective
OL,13,Fequipment (PPE).
OL,15,FAnd so began a desperate attempt to
OL,16,Fget hold of more PPE.
OL,18,FTo speed things up, the government set
OL,19,Fup a special procurement unit, which
OL,20,Fwas run by the Department of Health.
