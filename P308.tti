OL,6,FBecause of high costs to import goods
OL,7,Fto the US, businesses may now look to
OL,8,Fsend products which were originally
OL,9,Fbound for America to other countries
OL,10,Fwith lower tariffs, such as the UK,
OL,11,Fand sell them at a lower price.
OL,13,FThis is known as goods dumping ` when

OL,15,Fcountry at prices lower than they cost
OL,16,Fto make.
OL,18,FAs a result, some products could be

OL,15,For cheaper than they are sold at home.
