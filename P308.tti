OL,7,FDavid said: "We then proceeded to head
OL,8,Fup the street and I could see a bit of
OL,9,Fcommotion going on ahead and seen a
OL,10,Fdeck chair behind thrown in the air.
OL,11,FAt that point, I told my mates to
OL,12,Fwatch out.
OL,14,F"With that I could hear banging and
OL,15,Fscreaming then a loud noise of the
OL,16,Frevving of the car, we were jammed in
OL,17,Fbut I could start to see the crowd
OL,18,Fparting and then the car heading
OL,19,Ftowards us. It seemed to just head
OL,20,Ftowards us, so I managed to push my
OL,21,Ffriend away then brace myself."
