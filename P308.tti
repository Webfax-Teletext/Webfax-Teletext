OL,6,FVictims of the Infected Blood Scandal
OL,7,Fhave been harmed further by
OL,8,Fcompensation delays, a new report by
OL,9,Fthe Infected Blood Inquiry chair has
OL,10,Ffound today.
OL,12,FThe report by Sir Brian Langstaff was
OL,13,Fcommissioned after victims expressed
OL,14,Fdistress and frustration at the
OL,15,Fhandling of the compensation scheme to
OL,16,Fthe inquiry.
OL,18,F"Once again decisions have been made
OL,19,Fbehind closed doors leading to obvious
OL,20,Finjustices," wrote Sir Brian.
