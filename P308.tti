OL,6,FThe Snow Moon is February's full moon,
OL,7,Fnamed for the traditionally heavy
OL,8,Fsnowfall this month, our coldest month
OL,9,Fof the year.
OL,11,FA full moon happens when the side of
OL,12,Fthe moon facing Earth is fully
OL,13,Filluminated by the sun.
OL,15,FIt's named such because, historically,
OL,16,Fit signified one of winter's harshest
OL,17,Fperiods. It can also be called a Storm
OL,18,FMoon or a Hunger Moon.

OL,13,FIs there folklore or spiritual meaning
