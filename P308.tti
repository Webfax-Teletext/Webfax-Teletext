OL,6,FThere was once a time when British
OL,7,FMonarchs had absolute power.
OL,9,FBut in our parliamentary democracy,
OL,10,FKing Charles, like Queen Elizabeth
OL,11,Fbefore him, has very few prerogative
OL,12,Fpowers left ` most of them having been
OL,13,Fabolished or placed elsewhere with
OL,14,Fministers.
OL,16,FBut one of the King's remaining
OL,17,Fprerogative powers (exercised by the
OL,18,FMonarch acting alone) is his role in
OL,19,Fappointing a prime minister.

OL,6,FAn incumbent prime minister can simply

OL,8,Fbut by custom they will still usually

OL,11,FThe Monarch will ask the existing or
