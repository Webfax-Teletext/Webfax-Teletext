OL,6,FThe nutshell of what Keir Starmer has
OL,7,Fbeen saying over the past 24 hours,
OL,8,Fincluding in an interview with me, is
OL,9,Fthat we are living through a once-in-a-
OL,10,Fcentury shift in the structure of our
OL,11,Fpolitics - that one important
OL,12,Fpolitical party, the Conservatives,
OL,13,Fhave been supplanted by another,
OL,14,FFarage's Reform UK.

OL,6,FThe prime minister explicitly says
OL,7,Fthat the Conservative Party is now an
OL,8,Firrelevance, that the choice at the
OL,9,Fnext general election will be between
OL,10,FLabour and Reform, and that Reform is
OL,11,Foffering a "toxic divide and
OL,12,Fdivision...that will pull our country
OL,13,Fapart."
OL,15,FSo he will "run towards the fight"
OL,16,Fbecause otherwise "we will be torn
OL,17,Fapart by the politics of Reform in a
OL,18,Fway that we have not seen in this
OL,19,Fcountry ever before."

OL,6,FIt is worth pausing for a moment and

OL,10,FThe Tories have been the most enduring

OL,6,FFor several decades we've seen the

OL,6,FSo I am minded to agree with Starmer
OL,7,Fthat the rise of Farage's Reform is

OL,14,FThat said, Starmer's dignifying of

OL,16,Fmatters probably won't upset Farage
OL,17,Ftoo much, despite his tears yesterday
