OL,7,FRachel Reeves said that in the Budget
OL,8,Fnext week she would set out two fiscal
OL,9,Frules that the government will stick
OL,10,Fto. The first will be "the most

OL,15,F"I can confirm today our second rule,

OL,18,Ftake into account assets not just the

OL,7,FChanges to taxation are possibly the

OL,11,FIn their manifesto, Labour said they

OL,14,Fand Keir Starmer's warnings of a
