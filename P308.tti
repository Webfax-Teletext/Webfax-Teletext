OL,9,Fstudy by the food safety watchdog.
OL,11,FMore than 30% of adults said they have

OL,13,Fincluding allergies, intolerances and
OL,14,Fcoeliac disease, meaning they have an
OL,15,Funpleasant reaction to certain foods.
OL,17,FThe research also found that when

OL,19,Fwas often associated with an allergy
OL,20,Fto tree pollen, like birch.
