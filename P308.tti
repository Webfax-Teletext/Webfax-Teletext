OL,6,FThe previous record for the most
OL,7,Fascents in a year had stood since
OL,8,F2019, but "Pen y Fan Dan", as he's
OL,9,Faffectionately known, broke it in just
OL,10,Fsix months.
OL,12,FHis goal now is even more ambitious:
OL,13,Fto reach at least 730 summits by the
OL,14,Ftime his self-imposed year is up in
OL,15,FApril.
OL,17,FAnd he has a powerful motivation.
OL,19,F"I lost my soulmate and wife, Rita, to
OL,20,Fcancer in 2016," Chris says, pausing
OL,21,Fas he fights back tears.
