OL,6,FWe've seen a decade of dominance for
OL,7,Fthe SNP in Scottish politics, and if
OL,8,Fpolls are to be believed - that may
OL,9,Fnow be coming to an end.
OL,11,FThat relentless red tide sweeping
OL,12,Fthrough the rest of the country has
OL,13,Freached us north of the border and,
OL,14,Ffor the first time since 2010, it is
OL,15,Fvery possible that Labour will
OL,16,Fovertake the SNP as Scotland's biggest
OL,17,Fparty at Westminster.
OL,19,FThe SNP has publicly faced significant
OL,20,Fdifficulties in the last year or so.
