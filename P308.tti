OL,7,Fafter the Victoria Climbie inquiry
OL,8,Fthere was a great deal of progress,
OL,9,Fabout local safeguarding teams working
OL,10,Ftogether across the local services,
OL,11,Fbut sadly in the last decade because
OL,12,Fof financial cut backs in all of the
OL,13,Fservices, I'm afraid that services
OL,14,Fhave withdrawn into themselves.
OL,16,F"That has led in my view to a crisis
OL,17,Fdriven service, where services don't
OL,18,Freally become involved until the
OL,19,Fcrisis, and sometimes frankly it's too
OL,20,Flate."
