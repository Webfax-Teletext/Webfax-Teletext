OL,6,FUS President Donald Trump has accused
OL,7,FEuropean leaders of being "weak" for
OL,8,Ffailing to bring an end to the war
OL,9,Fbetween Russia and Ukraine.
OL,11,FIn an interview with Politico at the
OL,12,FWhite House on December 8, Trump
OL,13,Fclaimed Europe was "not producing" on
OL,14,Fthe work towards a peace deal in
OL,15,FUkraine and suggested the US may walk
OL,16,Faway from the negotiating table.
OL,18,FHis comments came after a US national
OL,19,Fsecurity document questioned whether
OL,20,FEuropean nations could remain
OL,21,F"reliable allies" to the US.
