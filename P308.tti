OL,8,Fmonths
OL,10,FGPs have threatened to bring the NHS
OL,11,Fto a "standstill" with unprecedented
OL,12,Findustrial action according to the
OL,13,FBritish Medical Association (BMA).
OL,15,FFamily doctors across England are
OL,16,Fbeing balloted by the BMA on staging
OL,17,Fcollective action amid a row over the
OL,18,Fnew contract for GP services in
OL,19,FEngland, which sees services given a
OL,20,F1.9% funding increase for 2024/25.
