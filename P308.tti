OL,14,F"Food fussiness is common among

OL,16,Fanxiety for parents and caregivers,
OL,17,Fwho often blame themselves for this

OL,6,FThe team found that picky eating
OL,7,Fpeaked around the age of seven and
OL,8,Fdeclined slightly after that.
OL,10,FThey said that genetic influence on
OL,11,Ffood fussiness increased significantly
OL,12,Fafter toddlerhood, from 60% at 16
OL,13,Fmonths to 83% at three years and
OL,14,Fremained stable (more than 70%) until
OL,15,Fthe age of 13.
OL,17,FMeanwhile, factors relating to the
OL,18,Fenvironment, including the types of
OL,19,Ffoods that are eaten at home, were
OL,20,Ffound to be significant only in
OL,21,Ftoddler years.
