OL,6,FNathan Angelakis, a PhD candidate at
OL,7,Fthe University of Adelaide, and his
OL,8,Fteam have discovered Australian sea
OL,9,Flions foraging across diverse seabed
OL,10,Fhabitats, including kelp reefs,
OL,11,Fseagrass meadows, sponge gardens and
OL,12,Fexpansive sand flats.
OL,14,FMr Angelakis has also captured footage
OL,15,Fof an adult female taking her pup to
OL,16,Fsea, providing the first evidence they
OL,17,Fhave that Australian sea lion mothers
