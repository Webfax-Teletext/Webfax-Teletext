OL,6,FThree sailors have been rescued from a
OL,7,Ftiny Pacific Ocean island after
OL,8,Fspelling out "HELP" in the sand using
OL,9,Fpalm leaves after a week of being
OL,10,Fstranded.
OL,12,FThe trio were rescued by a US Navy and
OL,13,FCoast Guard operation, that
OL,14,Funexpectedly turned into a family
OL,15,Freunion.
OL,17,FThe three men had been planning to go
OL,18,Ffishing in the waters around Pikelot
OL,19,FAtoll, part of Micronesia - before
OL,20,Ftheir 20-foot skiff was caught by
OL,21,Fswells and its motor was damaged.

OL,12,FThe castaways then gathered up palm

OL,14,F"HELP" on the beach, according to the
OL,15,FCoast Guard.
OL,17,FFor the week they were stranded, the
