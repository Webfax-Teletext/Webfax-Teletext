OL,7,FThe Dartford Borough councillor, who

OL,11,Faccused the party of having "a pretty

OL,14,FA Reform source said: "He got elected
OL,15,Fin July 2025 as a Reform councillor.
OL,16,FHe should resign his seat but he won't
OL,17,Fbecause he knows he will lose under
OL,18,Fthe Tory banner.
OL,20,F"We look forward to winning this seat
