OL,6,FSince the prime minister made his five
OL,7,Fpromises to the public almost 18
OL,8,Fmonths ago, it's Rishi Sunak's pledge
OL,9,Fto 'stop the boats' that has proven
OL,10,Fmost tricky to deliver on.
OL,12,FHis promise was definitive. Not to
OL,13,Fsimply reduce the number of small
OL,14,Fboats crossing the English Channel.
OL,15,FNot to increase the number of illegal
OL,16,Fimmigrants deported from the UK. It
OL,17,Fwas to stop the boats.
OL,19,FAs Mr Sunak himself said: "No
OL,20,Ftricks... no ambiguity... we will
OL,21,Feither have achieved them or not."

OL,12,FMany of the prime minister's own

OL,16,FThe deputy prime minister, was to stop
