OL,6,FClassics at the club, repeated on the
OL,7,Fradio, Scissor Sisters' songs are
OL,8,Fsynonymous with the early noughties.
OL,10,FNow 12 years after their last live
OL,11,Fshow, they're getting the band back
OL,12,Ftogether for a host of dates in 2025.
OL,14,FThe group is made of Americans but
OL,15,Ffound even greater success on this
OL,16,Fside of the Atlantic, with both their
OL,17,Ffirst and seconds albums (released in
OL,18,F2004 and 2006 respectively) making it
OL,19,Fto number 1 in the charts.

OL,3,CScissor Sister reunion: 'We are this

OL,6,FReflecting on how they first become
OL,7,Fstars, Jake says that "20 years ago,
OL,8,Fit was a very different time, it was
OL,9,Flike another era. CDs were being sold,
OL,10,Fsmartphones weren't around, bands were
OL,11,Feverywhere."
OL,13,F"There was a lot of bands and I think
OL,14,Fthat we were a band that came out with
OL,15,Fa very different sound and style and I
OL,16,Fthink we stood out."
OL,18,FOne of the reasons they stood out was
OL,19,Ftheir ethos of inclusivity and
OL,20,Facceptance, with LGBTQ+ positivity at
OL,21,Fthe heart of everything they did.

OL,6,FBabydaddy believes that "some people

OL,8,Fthat, as a gay band or a queer band.
OL,9,FAt the time we weren't in the closet,
OL,10,Fbut there was more to us than that. We

OL,14,F"America feels the need to

OL,13,FThe band - which delivered hits like
