OL,3,CWhat are the changes being made to
OL,4,Cdriving tests?
OL,6,FThe DVSA say a lot of people wait to
OL,7,Fthe last minute to change or cancel
OL,8,Ftheir test. This means too many
OL,9,Fappointments are being made available
OL,10,Fwith too short notice for anyone else
OL,11,Fto take them.
OL,13,FThe DVSA hope this change will give

OL,16,Fappointments. The move is part of the
