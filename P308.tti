OL,8,Fhas been designated a terrorist group
OL,9,Fby many Western countries, including
OL,10,Fthe UK.
OL,12,FIt was founded in 1982 after the
OL,13,FLebanon War, which saw Israel occupy
OL,14,Fmuch of the south of Lebanon.
OL,16,FThe group specifically set out to copy
OL,17,Fthe model of Ayatollah Khomeini's
OL,18,FIranian Revolution in 1979 and has
OL,19,Fbeen an anti-Israel, anti-western
