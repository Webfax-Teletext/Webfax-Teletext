OL,8,Fcolossal squid alive in the wild.
OL,10,FThe young squid is about 30

OL,12,Fmeters down in the South Atlantic.
OL,14,FResearchers used a remotely operated

OL,6,FThe colossal squid is rarely seen but
OL,7,Fit can grow to seven meters and weigh

OL,12,FThis year marks a century since the
