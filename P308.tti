OL,12,Fchickens, rabbits and guinea pigs in a
OL,13,Fbid to "imitate the natural food chain
OL,14,Fof the animals".
OL,16,F"That way, nothing goes to waste ` and
OL,17,Fwe ensure natural behaviour, nutrition
OL,18,Fand well-being of our predators," the
OL,19,Fpost said.

OL,6,FOn its website, the zoo said the

OL,9,Fbeing served up as food.
OL,11,FThe zoo is home to carnivorous

OL,15,FIts public request drew heated debate

OL,18,Fpraised the zoo's efforts to maintain
OL,19,Fnatural feeding behaviours.
