OL,6,FBy ITV News Producer Lauren Baulch
OL,8,FTo help facilitate his 20-point Gaza
OL,9,Fpeace plan, US President Donald Trump
OL,10,Fintroduced the Board of Peace.
OL,12,FInitially, a small collective of world
OL,13,Fleaders who would help oversee the
OL,14,FGaza ceasefire plan, it appears that
OL,15,Fthe vision has since expanded.
OL,17,FSince its announcement, Trump has
OL,18,Fextended his invitations to dozens of
OL,19,Fnations and even suggested that the
OL,20,Fboard could help broker other global
OL,21,Fconflicts.
