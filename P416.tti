OL,8,Fshowing the lifelike figure of a woman
OL,9,Flying underwater.
OL,11,FCritics have called the artwork, in
OL,12,FCanterbury, Kent, "offensive and
OL,13,Finsensitive" because it is reminiscent
OL,14,Fof a drowning victim.

OL,6,FThe artwork was formally gifted to the

OL,10,FIt is known as Alluvia because of the
OL,11,Fdeposits of alluvial sand left behind
OL,12,Fby changes in the river flow.
OL,14,FThe new statue replaced similar
OL,15,Funderwater statues of women, who lit
OL,16,Fup at night. They had become damaged
OL,17,Fand were covered in algae.
OL,19,FArtist, Jason DeCaires Taylor, said:
OL,20,F"If there was no reaction, it would
OL,21,Fmean the work was benign and insipid.
