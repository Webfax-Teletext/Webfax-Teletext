OL,6,FA man from Basingstoke has said he

OL,8,Fthe best driving test slot he can book
OL,9,Fis over 80 miles away, and isn't until
OL,10,FApril next year.
OL,12,FAlistair Cook says being unable to
OL,13,Fdrive means that he can't reach

OL,15,Fnearest test he can book is in the

OL,18,FHe says that despite regularly getting

OL,20,Fhe's had no luck.
