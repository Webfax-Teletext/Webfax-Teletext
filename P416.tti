OL,6,FVeterans say "it's a disgrace" that a

OL,8,Fcommemorating those who served in the
OL,9,FFirst World War.
OL,11,FThe artwork at Tilgate Park in
OL,12,FCrawley, Sussex, was made in 2018, to
OL,13,Fmark 100 years since the end of the
OL,14,FGreat War but was painted over in
OL,15,FFebruary.
OL,17,FSome residents say, they are hurt that

OL,19,Fanniversary of VE day next Thursday (8
OL,20,FMay) and are demanding it to be
OL,21,Freinstated.
