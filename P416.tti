OL,6,F"However, I remembered that before

OL,8,FCromwell with his life, telling him
OL,9,Fthat she wanted his head off his

OL,15,FDr Emmerson added; "It is also true to
OL,16,Fsay that Cromwell didn't only break
OL,17,Fthe Boleyns' fortunes, he very much
OL,18,Fmade them, and was integral to their
