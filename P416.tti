OL,7,FThe discovery of sets of prehistoric
OL,8,Fteeth has revealed that groups of meat-
OL,9,Feating dinosaurs stalked the East
OL,10,FSussex coast 135 million years ago.
OL,12,FThe research, led by the University of
OL,13,FSouthampton, has revealed that a
OL,14,F"whole community of predators"
OL,15,Fincluding tyrannosaurs, spinosaurs and
OL,16,Fmembers of the velociraptor family
OL,17,Fwould have been found in the Bexhill-

OL,7,FDr Chris Barker, lead author of the

OL,10,Ftime that tyrannosaurs had been
OL,11,Fidentified in sediments of this age

OL,14,FHe said: "Meat-eating dinosaurs `
