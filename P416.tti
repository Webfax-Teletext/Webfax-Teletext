OL,8,Fheard details of a patient with a

OL,10,Fwith tiredness and an iron deficiency
OL,11,Fand was given an intimate examination
OL,12,Fto rule out cancer.
OL,14,FWhen he was accused of having a
OL,15,F"tenuous medical justification", Dr
OL,16,FManson said: "You base things on your

OL,18,Ftimes, because if he does have
OL,19,Fsomething serious you are obliged to

OL,11,FThe prosecuting lawyer Jennifer Knight
