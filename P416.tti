OL,5,F"You did the training for all the
OL,6,Fdifferent things."
OL,8,FOnce in France Mr Rutland drove
OL,9,FChurchill, Sherman and Cromwell tanks.
OL,10,FAnd as crews were flexible he also
OL,11,Ftook turns as a gunner and loader.
OL,13,F"We handed on the twelfth - six days
OL,14,Fafter D-Day," he said.
OL,16,F"Very early in the morning. We had
OL,17,Fbeen loading all the day before. It
OL,18,Fwas an American landing ship, not a
OL,19,Flanding craft.

OL,5,F"And all the big vehicles were up at
OL,6,Fthe top and the tanks were on the
OL,7,Fbottom. We were stood at the top
OL,8,Fwatching the landing craft coming back.
OL,10,F"There were lots of ships coming back
OL,11,Fto pick more people up. And we landed
OL,12,Fon Gold Beach.
OL,14,F"As the tanks moved into the
OL,15,Fcountryside they had to negotiate
OL,16,Ftheir route very carefully as they
OL,17,Fcame under German shelling.

OL,5,F"We went into a field north of Bayeux.
OL,6,FWe had to take all the sailing off the
OL,7,Ftanks before we were sent to the
OL,8,Ffront. I was the co-driver actually.
OL,10,F"When the Germans retreated they
OL,11,Fpulled the dead Germans into the road
OL,12,Fand they put mines into the side so
OL,13,Fthat if the tank went onto the side it
OL,14,Fwould blow the tractor off. The co-
OL,15,Fdriver of the first tank had to get
OL,16,Fout and move the dead bodies.
OL,18,F"The Germans were firing at you all

OL,5,F"If a tank was hit you were very lucky
OL,6,Fif anybody got out. All the five were
OL,7,Fgone. If they hit the ammunition it
OL,8,Fset the tank on fire. You never
OL,9,Fthought about that.
OL,11,F"You were just hoping that they missed
