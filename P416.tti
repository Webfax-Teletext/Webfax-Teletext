OL,6,FThe court heard that Rocky had died
OL,7,Ffrom starvation and dehydration. The
OL,8,Fvet stated: "The amount of faeces
OL,9,Fbuild-up in the kitchen area would be
OL,10,Fconsistent with Rocky having had
OL,11,Faccess to food and water on a regular
OL,12,Fbasis for a prolonged period as
OL,13,Findicated by Carrie Hansford.
OL,15,F"However, at some point this must have

OL,17,Fcaused Rocky to lose weight and arrive
OL,18,Fat an emaciated bodily condition.
