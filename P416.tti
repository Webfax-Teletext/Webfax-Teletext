OL,7,FSpeaking to ITV Meridian, Cherie said:
OL,8,F"Who would want to take my
OL,9,Fgrandmother's gravestone? It just
OL,10,Fmakes no sense.
OL,12,F"It's just really heartbreaking,
OL,13,Fespecially as well, it's coming up to
OL,14,Fa 19-year anniversary when Nan passed,
OL,15,Fand Christmas, and we come here at
OL,16,Fthose times to remember her.
OL,18,F"Now a memory of her has been taken
OL,19,Faway, and it's absolutely
OL,20,Fheartbreaking.
