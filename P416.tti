OL,5,F"This was about 3am and when they were
OL,6,Fdone we were all waiting for (HMS)
OL,7,FBelfast to fire its first shot which
OL,8,Fwas the signal to start D-Day
OL,10,F"I was in my boat, and when first
OL,11,Flight came they went in. I picked some
OL,12,Fsoldiers up and took them in and
OL,13,Flanded them. And then came out and was
OL,14,Fjust ferrying all the time.
OL,16,F"My Major said at 11am 'I want you to
OL,17,Fgo to Arromanche. No-one has been
OL,18,Fthere. It's mind. And I want you to
OL,19,Fpick two people up.' I said yes.

OL,5,F"The Germans were after them, so we
OL,6,Fgot to Arromanches and the Germans
OL,7,Fdidn't take any notice of us.
OL,9,F"I didn't think they thought we would
OL,10,Fdo it. And the Free French had these
OL,11,Ftwo people - a man and a woman. They
OL,12,Fwere spies. Get a little bit of sand
OL,13,Fwe got - they would see us and let
OL,14,Fthem run. And they ran onto my boat.
OL,15,FAnd we were off.
OL,17,F"And that's when the Germans knew we
OL,18,Fwere there. I took these two people to
OL,19,Fa Canadian hospital ship out in the
OL,20,Fbay and passed them off.
