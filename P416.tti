OL,12,Fopened the door to her house last week
OL,13,Fin the dark to find what she thought
OL,14,Fwas a spider or earwig on the skirting
OL,15,Fboard.
OL,17,FRealising it wasn't, she called her
OL,18,Ffriend to ask what to do. The pair
OL,19,Fdecided it could be a scorpion.

OL,13,FShe decided to contact the National

OL,15,Ffor a photograph of the scorpion.
OL,17,FWhen they saw it, Ms Aitchison said
