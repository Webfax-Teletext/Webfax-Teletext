OL,6,FJonathan Greenwell, Assistant Manager,
OL,7,FDogs Trust, explained dogs can't
OL,8,Fregulate their body temperature in the
OL,9,Fsame way as humans.
OL,11,FHe said: "When you think about it,
OL,12,Fimagine you're sort of experiencing
OL,13,Fthe same heat you are, but you're
OL,14,Fliterally wearing a fur coat.
OL,16,F"They can overheat very quickly. I
OL,17,Fmean there is really no safe amount of
OL,18,Ftime to leave a dog in a hot car on a
OL,19,Fhot day.
