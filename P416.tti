OL,7,FThe Prime Minister has said that
OL,8,Fspecial educational needs and
OL,9,Fdisabilities (SEND) is probably the
OL,10,Fissue that gets raised with him the
OL,11,Fmost.
OL,13,FSpeaking to ITV News Meridian from a
OL,14,Fschool breakfast club in Reading, Sir
OL,15,FKeir Starmer said the Government must
OL,16,Fget reform right and must therefore
OL,17,Ftake the time to consult with parents.
OL,19,FSir Keir said: "I think, uniformly,
OL,20,Fthere's a sense that the system at the
OL,21,Fmoment isn't working and needs reform.
