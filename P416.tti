OL,7,FThe Director for Barr Build says he
OL,8,Fthinks the suicide rate is high in
OL,9,Fthis industry because people do not
OL,10,Fopen up on a construction site.
OL,12,FHe said: "People tend to bottle it up
OL,13,Fbasically, so they don't have a voice
OL,14,Fanywhere.
OL,16,F"So it's almost a silent problem and
OL,17,Fwe're really aware of it.
