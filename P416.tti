OL,6,F"We was paddling in the water", Max
OL,7,Ftold ITV Meridian. "And we saw the man
OL,8,Fstruggling behind us in the water. So
OL,9,Fwe thought something's definitely
OL,10,Fwrong.
OL,12,F"Adrenaline kind of took over. It was

OL,15,Fso we had to help him."
OL,17,FElla said the rescue was difficult,
OL,18,Fbut her and Max persevered. She said:
OL,19,F"It was hard because he'd gone really
OL,20,Fweak, like from where he'd swallowed
