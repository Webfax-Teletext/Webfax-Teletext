OL,8,FA brown bear who underwent pioneering,

OL,10,Fhas rejoined his old playmates after

OL,13,FThree-year-old Boki, who lives at
OL,14,FWildwood Trust near Canterbury, Kent,
OL,15,Fstarted suffering seizures last
OL,16,Fsummer, which were believed to have
OL,17,Fbeen caused by hydrocephalus (fluid on

OL,6,FIt was decided that brain surgery was
OL,7,Fthe best option for Boki, who went
OL,8,Funder the knife in October.
OL,10,FWorld-leading veterinary surgeon
OL,11,FRomain Pizzi, who waived his fee for
OL,12,Fthe job, fitted a stent between Boki's
OL,13,Fbrain and abdomen to help him pass the
OL,14,Fexcess fluid.
OL,16,FThe young bear made a "remarkable
OL,17,Frecovery" and was weaned off his
OL,18,Fmedication with no adverse effects,
OL,19,Fjust before he went into torpor (semi-
OL,20,Fhibernation).

OL,6,FBoki has now reconnected with his

OL,8,Fthat staff at Wildwood said would mark
OL,9,Fa major moment in his recovery.
OL,11,FThe bears wasted no time reconnecting,
OL,12,Fand Boki quickly began play-fighting
OL,13,Fwith Scruff just as he had before they
OL,14,Fwere separated nearly a year ago.
OL,16,FHead of bears at Wildwood, Jon Forde,
OL,17,Fsaid the bears seemed to know
OL,18,Fsomething was wrong with Boki long
OL,19,Fbefore his diagnosis.
