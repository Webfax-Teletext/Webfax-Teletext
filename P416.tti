OL,6,FHe was dropped sixty metres from
OL,7,FPegasus Bridge at Ranville, which had
OL,8,Fbeen seized in order to help the

OL,11,FHe said: "We all sat in a long line
OL,12,Fhaving a little sing-song.
OL,14,F"Thinking it was going to be easy,
OL,15,Fwhich it wasn't. As soon as it lands,
OL,16,Fall out as quick as possible. Thirty

OL,6,F"And you see a lot of gliders alight,

OL,10,F"But you could hear your own friends
OL,11,Fall shouting. Nothing in particular.
OL,12,FThat was the first bit of luck.
OL,14,F"This was early morning and it was
OL,15,Fstill dark. We landed - loads of
OL,16,Fpeople - all in the same area and our
OL,17,Frendezvous was going down the river
OL,18,Fabout half an hour away and dig in
OL,19,Fthere. German reinforcements were

OL,13,F"It was very frightening at times."
OL,15,FThe task after landing was to help

OL,9,FBritish paratrooper laying there blown
OL,10,Fto pieces and from that minute it was
OL,11,Fnot exciting, it was serious.
OL,13,F"And all you had to do was make sure
