OL,5,F"So we were walking back to school
OL,6,Fwith our wet bathers tucked underneath
OL,7,Four arms. And when we got there, the
OL,8,Fassembly hall door was open onto the
OL,9,Fplayground and we had the radio on.
OL,11,F"We thought 'what's happening'.
OL,13,F"The radio was Richard Dimbleby
OL,14,Fdescribing the D-Day beaches, actually
OL,15,Fdescribing Omaha Beach. I found that

OL,5,F"And everybody was listening. A hushed

OL,7,Fwe sat and listened. Maybe about 10
OL,8,Fminutes and finished. And we went into
OL,9,Flunch and we had a half day.
OL,11,F"Next day, our headmistress addressed
OL,12,Fthe whole lot and we thought the war
OL,13,Fwas closer to ending."
OL,15,FAccording to Mrs Sayed remembers
OL,16,FAmerican troops had been stationed in
OL,17,Fthe area for some time and had been
OL,18,Frehearsing landing on beaches.
OL,20,F"They weren't allowed in town," she

OL,5,F"The whole of North Devon was an area
OL,6,Fgiven over to the American army. It
OL,7,Fwas the Western assault Force. I think
OL,8,Fheadquarters was in Woolacombe.
OL,10,F"So the whole of the coast was used -
OL,11,Fthe and cliffs. The landing craft used
OL,12,Ffor beach work. The coastal paths were

OL,5,F"We didn't know that because we were
OL,6,Fgoing on a cycle ride along the
OL,7,Fcoastal path and a few miles out of
OL,8,FBarnstable. A British Army officer
OL,9,Fstepped out from beside the road.
OL,10,F''Halt'' with a gun. We said 'What is
OL,11,Fit?' 'Oh, this is the War Department.
OL,12,FYou can't go any further.'
OL,14,F"So we had to take a longer way round.

OL,5,F"I was with a school friend and my
OL,6,Fauntie. And when we stopped, the
OL,7,FAmericans came out, surrounded us and
OL,8,Fwanted to chat, which they did. It was
OL,9,Fquite interesting. 'Where you from,
OL,10,Fwhat you're doing', this sort of
OL,11,Fthing? Well, one of them said 'Do you
OL,12,Fwant to sell your bicycle and they
OL,13,Foffered #5.
OL,15,F"I said no I need it to get to school
