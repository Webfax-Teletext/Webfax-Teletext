OL,6,FWhen asked by ITV Meridian about the
OL,7,Fcomparison to Magaluf, Richard said:
OL,8,F"Anyone who has been down here would
OL,9,Freally struggle to compare it to

OL,11,Fare more important issues in the
OL,12,Fworld, this is a storm in a tea cup.
OL,14,FIt was a very small number of owners
OL,15,Fwho registered objections. We know
OL,16,Fthat the wider beach hut community are
OL,17,Feither apathetic as to what is going
OL,18,Fon here or they support us about what
OL,19,Fis going on here. It's a mixed range
OL,20,Fof views."
