OL,6,FHe said: "We had an inkling, an idea.
OL,7,FBecause we were doing a lot of
OL,8,Fexaminations of beaches and asking a
OL,9,Flot of questions. We had been training
OL,10,Ffor it for about twelve months outside
OL,11,FBournemouth and as far as Aryshire.
OL,13,F"It was a very mixed effort and
OL,14,Feveryone combined."

OL,6,F"We were in three-tonne Bedfords. We
OL,7,Fall reversed on. We were fortunate

OL,10,Funit where they were in and captured
OL,11,Fthem all.
OL,13,F"And they just carried on eating their

OL,15,Fwere pleased to be captured."
OL,17,FAs a trained mechanic Mr Teacher was
