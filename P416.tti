OL,6,FITV Meridian's Malcolm Shaw reports on
OL,7,Fthe unsolved murder of Keith Lyon.
OL,9,FNearly sixty years ago, Keith Lyon
OL,10,Fleft his home in Ovingdean in East
OL,11,FSussex to buy a geometry set for his
OL,12,Fhomework.
OL,14,FThe 12-year-old schoolboy was walking
OL,15,Fon a footpath in the Sussex Downs when
OL,16,Fhe was attacked. He was stabbed eleven
OL,17,Ftimes before his body was found in the
OL,18,Fbushes by a teenage girl walking her
OL,19,Fdogs.

OL,6,FThe case started one of Sussex

OL,8,Fafter six decades without a
OL,9,Fbreakthrough, a former police
OL,10,Fdetective says Keith's killer could
OL,11,Fstill be found.
OL,13,F"We're now in a very lucky position
OL,14,Fwith regards to this case," said Mark
OL,15,FWilliams-Thomas, an investigative
OL,16,Fjournalist and former policeman.
OL,17,F"Because (the police) have a profile
OL,18,Fthat the investigating officer
OL,19,Fbelieves may well connect the suspect
OL,20,Fof that DNA to the crime.
