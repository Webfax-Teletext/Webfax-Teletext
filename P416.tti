OL,8,FKent.
OL,10,FConcerns have been raised over the
OL,11,Fhealth of local swan populations in

OL,13,Ffound sick or dead in Canterbury and
OL,14,FThanet.
OL,16,FWildlife rescuers say the recent rise
OL,17,Fof the birds in distress in the
OL,18,FChislet area is worrying, and are
OL,19,Fcalling on the government, and local
OL,20,Fauthorities to investigate why they
