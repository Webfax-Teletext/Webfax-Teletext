OL,6,FLCT 898 was the target of machine gun
OL,7,Ffire when it arrived and there were

OL,10,FMr Willis said: "As far as I was
OL,11,Fconcerned we were far too big to go
OL,12,Fdown on one of the beaches.
OL,14,F"However, that didn't matter - we
OL,15,Fwent. I was very worried about getting
