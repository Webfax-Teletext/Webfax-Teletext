OL,6,FConstantly avoiding snipers his team's
OL,7,Ftask was to find a field where a
OL,8,Ftemporary airfield with a grass runway
OL,9,Fcould be built.
OL,11,FThis was in the very early stages of
OL,12,Fthe invasion when the Allies didn't
OL,13,Fhave access to established airfields.
OL,15,FAn Advanced Landing Ground was then
OL,16,Fset up at Plumetot where Auster
OL,17,Fspotter planes flew from, finding
OL,18,Ftargets for the artillery guns to fire

OL,6,FThe planes would carry a pilot and a
OL,7,Fspotter whose job it was to find
OL,8,Fplaces where the enemy was gathering.
OL,10,FAs a mechanic Mr Woodrow helped
OL,11,Fmaintain and inspect the aircraft
OL,12,Fdaily.
OL,14,FHe said: "I would be working on the
OL,15,Fengine and keeping them going. We had
OL,16,Fto see that they could keep flying.
OL,18,F"By being a slow plane they could
OL,19,Fhover and find the targets.
