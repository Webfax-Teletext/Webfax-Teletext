OL,6,FIt's just after 8pm on a cold Monday
OL,7,Fnight in the autumn of 1977. An 11-
OL,8,Fyear-old girl called Michelle is
OL,9,Fwalking home from Guides in Cardiff,
OL,10,Fwalking the final five minutes of the
OL,11,Fjourney by herself.
OL,13,FHer mum usually met her for this part
OL,14,Fof the route, but her younger brother
OL,15,Fwas unwell, so she proceeded alone on
OL,16,Fher way home.
OL,18,F"There was a guy on the pavement and
OL,19,Fas I was walking towards him, I
OL,20,Frealised he wasn't moving out of my
OL,21,Fway," she tells ITV Cymru Wales.
