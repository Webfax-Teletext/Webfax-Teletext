OL,7,Fwhilst on the expedition, Sophie said
OL,8,Fthere were lots of things she needed

OL,11,FShe said, "It required a lot of
OL,12,Fpreparation for me to go out on that
OL,13,Fvessel with Cystic Fibrosis because it
OL,14,Fhadn't been done before, we didn't
OL,15,Fknow what might happen.
OL,17,F"For me the biggest worry was how
