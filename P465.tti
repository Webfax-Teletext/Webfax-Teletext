OL,12,FLooking ahead to the weekend, with

OL,14,FNichols said: "It's cool because it's
OL,15,Fbringing it, I think, to the centre of

OL,14,FTalking about the importance of giving

OL,13,FOne of the new bands being given a

OL,15,Fwho practice at the Cathays Community

OL,10,Fnow we're really cracking down because
OL,11,Fit's in a few days."
OL,13,FBands like Junior Bill are a source of
OL,14,Finspiration for others looking to
OL,15,Ffollow in their footsteps.
OL,17,FPeter, also from Casual Smart, said:
OL,18,F"It's cool to see a band go through

OL,20,Fwell. Like, we could do that at some
OL,21,Fpoint. It gives us that belief."

OL,7,FOne of the challenges, according to
OL,8,FJunior Bill, is age restrictions on

OL,11,FHowever, another is the . Youth clubs
OL,12,Fand music venues more generally are
OL,13,Fstrapped for cash.
OL,15,FIt all means opportunities can be few
