OL,6,FAccording to the neighbour, the XL
OL,7,Fbully was off its lead and the owner
OL,8,Fwas not in sight.
OL,10,FThe court heard how Ebony's owner was
OL,11,F"panicking" due to the "aggression" of
OL,12,Fthe XL bully, known as Sky, and feared
OL,13,Fhis dog would be killed.
OL,15,FHe proceeded to pick up Ebony but felt
OL,16,FSky was "more than capable of causing
OL,17,Fserious injury to both him and his
OL,18,Fdog".

OL,9,Fappearing not to know what to do. A
OL,10,Fmale at her property shouted 'kick
