OL,8,F"Before the scheme came in, the road
OL,9,Fcoming up was narrow. We had no
OL,10,Felectricity, no main water, nothing.
OL,12,F"And when they were talking about the
OL,13,Fscheme to come in, lot of people, the
OL,14,Flocals weren't happy at all. But soon
OL,15,Fthey became very happy when it was
OL,16,Ffinished. A lot of us in the valley
OL,17,Fhere, had jobs here. You had all the
OL,18,Ffacilities here, the wages were good.
OL,19,FYou couldn't get a better place to

OL,19,Fbut then it lasts for such a long time.
