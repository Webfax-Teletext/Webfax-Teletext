OL,7,FA Port Talbot steelworker has told ITV
OL,8,FWales that his community is prepared
OL,9,Fto fight to keep steel jobs in the
OL,10,Ftown.
OL,12,FIt comes as announced last month that
OL,13,Fit will axe nearly 3,000 jobs in the
OL,14,Fcoming years ` the majority of which
OL,15,Fare expected to be at its Port Talbot
OL,16,Fplant.JLocal resident and steelworker
OL,17,FDale Fischer said: "There's still a
OL,18,Fbit of a flame flickering for me to be
OL,19,Fhonest. Until they close the gate on
OL,20,Fus, I'm not going to accept it."

OL,13,FThis means the site would no longer
OL,14,Fmake steel from scratch, but would
OL,15,Frecycle scrap metal instead.JHowever,
OL,16,Fthis method of steel production is
OL,17,Fless labour-intensive, meaning far
OL,18,Ffewer workers would be needed.
