OL,7,FThe IOPC director, David Ford said,
OL,8,F"The content of some of the messages

OL,13,F"We did not find any evidence to
OL,14,Fsubstantiate an allegation that Gwent
OL,15,FPolice tried to cover up inappropriate
OL,16,Fmessages, which might have indicated
OL,17,Fcorruption. The evidence showed that
