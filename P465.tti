OL,6,FThe Royal Welsh Show and the National
OL,7,FEisteddfod have today joined forces to
OL,8,Foppose school term reorganisation
OL,9,Fplans, which could see pupils in class
OL,10,Fduring the first week of the
OL,11,Ftraditional school summer holidays.
OL,13,FThat would coincide with the annual
OL,14,FRoyal Welsh Show, which is the largest
OL,15,Fagricultural show of its kind in
OL,16,FEurope and takes place at Llanelwedd
OL,17,Fevery year.

OL,6,FShow organisers say that if pupils and

OL,8,Fevent because they were in school, the
OL,9,Fsociety "could lose more than one

OL,12,FHe said: "This would be a permanent

OL,12,FLaura Doel, director of the National

OL,14,Fsaid: "As a union, we believe that any

OL,12,FHowever the debate centres around
