OL,6,FThe head of an abbey on a remote Welsh
OL,7,Fisland has apologised for the "great
OL,8,Fsuffering" endured by children who
OL,9,Fwere abused by a late monk, and the
OL,10,F"culture of secrecy and cover-up" that
OL,11,Fkept it hidden, after an independent

OL,14,FFather Jan Rossey, who last year
OL,15,Fbecame the Abbot of Caldey Abbey, off
OL,16,Fthe the coast of Pembrokeshire and

OL,18,Fcommissioned a review into alleged

OL,6,FFather Thaddeus Kotik, who died in
OL,7,F1992, sexually abused girls and boys
OL,8,Fwhile he was a monk at the abbey. The
OL,9,Freview concluded that he used a

OL,11,Fto entice children into the monastery

OL,13,Fthem.
OL,15,FThe report also said he "groomed"
