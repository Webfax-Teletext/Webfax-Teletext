OL,9,Fthink that's even more relevant now
OL,10,Fthan it was 120 years ago."
OL,12,FFarmers across Wales have staging
OL,13,Fdemonstrations over the new
OL,14,Fsustainable farming scheme - which
OL,15,Fthey fear will lead to 1,000s of job

OL,6,FThe Minister for Rural Affairs Lesley
OL,7,FGriffiths has told WalesOnline that
OL,8,Fshe hopes no farmers will go out of
OL,9,Fbusiness. She says the aim of the
OL,10,Fscheme is "to make sure we secure food
OL,11,Fproduction systems".
OL,13,FShe continued: "It's also about
OL,14,Fsafeguarding the environment and
OL,15,Faddressing the climate and nature
OL,16,Femergency, with both adaptation and
OL,17,Fmitigation."
OL,19,FMs Griffiths added that the Welsh
OL,20,FGovernment "will make changes to the
OL,21,Fscheme" before it is rolled out.

OL,7,Fplays a "key role" in giving the
