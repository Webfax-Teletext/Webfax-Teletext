OL,8,FNatural Resources Wales after it
OL,9,Fapproved the expansion of three
OL,10,Fpoultry farms in Powys.
OL,12,FThey've accused the regulator of
OL,13,F"washing its hands of manure pollution
OL,14,Fby taking an unlawfully narrow view of
OL,15,Fits powers."
OL,17,FThe case focuses on whether NRW is
OL,18,Fproperly using its role as
OL,19,Fenvironmental regulator to prevent
OL,20,Fpollution from intensive farming.

OL,6,FIn November 2025 NRW approved permit

OL,8,Fpoultry units to expand in Powys.
OL,10,FRiver Action argue that in doing so,
OL,11,FNRW proceeded on the basis that the
OL,12,Fenvironmental impacts of manure, that
OL,13,Fmay leave farms and enter rivers like
OL,14,Fthe Wye and the Severn, would be
OL,15,Foutside of the regulator's control.
OL,17,FRiver Action says that the law
OL,18,Frequires NRW to assess and prevent
OL,19,Fpotential pollution impacts that could
OL,20,Farise if manure is exported off-site.
