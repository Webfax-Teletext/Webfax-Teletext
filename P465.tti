OL,7,FA mother whose baby died after

OL,9,Fpeople to have a vaccine which became
OL,10,Favailable on the NHS on Monday.
OL,12,FThree-month-old Rumer was born with a
OL,13,Flife-limiting condition called apnea,
OL,14,Fbut died after catching respiratory
OL,15,Fsyncytial virus - also known as RSV.
OL,17,FIt's a common respiratory condition,
OL,18,Fwhich for most of us brings cold like
OL,19,Fsymptoms.

OL,15,FShe continued: "It was the RSV that
