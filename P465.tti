OL,6,FTalking to ITV Wales, Wilkinson said:
OL,7,F"The biggest challenge here in Wales
OL,8,Fis probably a short window before the
OL,9,Ffirst qualification game and (going)
OL,10,Fright into a qualification year. The
OL,11,Fdraw is on the fifth (of March) and
OL,12,Fthen I will have, I think, 24 days
OL,13,Fbefore camp begins and then I have
OL,14,Fthree days on the grass with the
OL,15,Fplayers before our first game."
OL,17,FHowever, she has faith, saying: "I'm
OL,18,Fcoming into a team that is clearly on

OL,20,Fachieve and they're ready to do it."
