OL,6,FShe was told two hours after arriving
OL,7,Fat Nottingham City Hospital, after
OL,8,Fexperiencing blood loss, there was no
OL,9,Fsign of a heartbeat.
OL,11,FLeah said: "It was a very long time
OL,12,Fbefore I found out what had actually
OL,13,Fhappened. Nobody was looking at me or
OL,14,Ftelling me anything."
OL,16,F"He was 1 pound 5 when he was born so
OL,17,Fhe was really tiny."
OL,19,FShe was later told there were issues
OL,20,Fwith her placenta but a post mortem
OL,21,Fdidn't determine why he died.

OL,11,FShe said: "When I was in hospital I
