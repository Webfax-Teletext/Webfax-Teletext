OL,9,F"Council staff work hard every day to
OL,10,Fsupport the people of our city and we
OL,11,Fknow that is appreciated by most
OL,12,Fpeople, but sadly cases of abuse are
OL,13,Frising, and this cannot be allowed to
OL,14,Fcontinue.
OL,16,F"There are too many incidents where
OL,17,Fsome people cross the line and become
OL,18,Fabusive, as in this case where two
OL,19,Fofficers were simply trying to do
OL,20,Ftheir job and help residents.
