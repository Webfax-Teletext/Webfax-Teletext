OL,6,FA dad from Leicester who originally
OL,7,Fthought his dizziness over Christmas
OL,8,Fwas because of overindulging over the
OL,9,Ffestive period, says a simple blood
OL,10,Fpressure check saved his life.
OL,12,FSoon after he went to his local
OL,13,Fpharmacy to get his high blood
OL,14,Fpressure checked, Nick Taylor had a
OL,15,Fseizure, and after a brain scan, found
OL,16,Fout he had a brain tumour the size of
OL,17,Fa grape.
