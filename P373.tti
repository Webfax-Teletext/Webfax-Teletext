OL,6,FHomeowners who live next to the M5 in
OL,7,FBirmingham are eagerly awaiting the
OL,8,Fresults of an investigation into the
OL,9,Fremoval of around 100 trees that they
OL,10,Fsay protected them from the noise and
OL,11,Fpollution of the motorway.
OL,13,FBack in 2021, nearly 100 trees that
OL,14,Flined the M5 in Quinton, shielding
OL,15,Fresidents of Clay Drive from the
OL,16,Fconstant roar of traffic, were
OL,17,Fsuddenly chopped down.

OL,6,FNational Grid, with the green light

OL,9,F"essential safety work."
OL,11,FBut for the locals, it felt like a
