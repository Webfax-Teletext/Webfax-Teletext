OL,9,F"wilful blindness" when it came to
OL,10,Fallowing disgraced surgeon Ian
OL,11,FPaterson to operate on patients.
OL,13,FHalf a decade on, it seems that little
OL,14,Fprogress has been made on the
OL,15,Frecommendations suggested for public
OL,16,Fsafety.
OL,18,FIan Paterson treated more than 11,000
OL,19,Fpatients in the NHS and private
OL,20,Fhospitals in the West Midlands between
OL,21,F1998 and 2011.
