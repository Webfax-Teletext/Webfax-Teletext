OL,6,FIn more than 30 years as a journalist,
OL,7,FI have never covered a trial quite
OL,8,Flike this.
OL,10,FDr Jonathan (Peter) Brooks, 61, was
OL,11,Fconvicted of two counts of attempted
OL,12,Fmurder, attempted arson with intent to
OL,13,Fendanger life, and possession of a
OL,14,Fknife in a public place, after he
OL,15,Fknifed former colleague Graeme Perks
OL,16,Fin the early hours of January 14 2021.
OL,18,FJurors deliberated for more than 12
OL,19,Fhours before finding Brooks guilty of
OL,20,Fall the charges against him.

OL,6,FThe judge, Mr Justice Pepperall,
OL,7,Fdescribed it as "highly unusual case"
OL,8,Fand for good reason.
OL,10,FFor a start, there was no-one in the
OL,11,Fdock - Dr Jonathan (Peter) Brooks, who
OL,12,Fhas been in prison on remand since
OL,13,F2021, had chosen not to attend his
OL,14,Ftrial.
OL,16,FAnd there was no-one in court
OL,17,Frepresenting him - again, his
OL,18,Fdecision. It meant we were left with a
OL,19,Fcase for the prosecution, but no
OL,20,Fdefence.

OL,6,FSo, some might ask, how could Brooks
OL,7,Fget a fair trial?
OL,9,FMr Justice Pepperall took various
OL,10,Fsteps to address this.
OL,12,FThere was cross-examination of some of
OL,13,Fthe prosecution's witnesses - the
OL,14,Fcourt appointed an advocate to
OL,15,Fquestion the victim Graeme Perks and

OL,6,FThe judge also urged the jury to
OL,7,Fassess the prosecution's case with a
OL,8,Fcritical eye - they were asked to
OL,9,Fconsider an argument that Brooks acted
OL,10,Fin self-defence.
OL,12,FIn the end, though, he made it clear
OL,13,Fthat it was Brooks' choices which left
OL,14,Fhim in the position where he was on
OL,15,Ftrial for a serious offence without a
OL,16,Fdefence to put before the court.
OL,18,FThat would make this case unusual

OL,11,FThere were no less than nine dates set
