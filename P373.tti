OL,6,FChief Inspector Richard Bailey, said:
OL,7,F"Cannabis farms like to this are often
OL,8,Flinked to serious and organised crime
OL,9,Fgangs, the drugs they sell have a
OL,10,Fnegative impact on our communities and
OL,11,Fcan lead to other localised
OL,12,Fcriminality.
OL,14,F"The cultivation of these crops can
OL,15,Falso lead to the harm and exploitation
OL,16,Fof vulnerable people.
OL,18,F"Shutting down this grow today shows
OL,19,Fwe will not tolerate criminal activity
OL,20,Fwithin our communities."
