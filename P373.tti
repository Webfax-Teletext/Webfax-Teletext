OL,6,FIt's like a scene from an apocalyptic
OL,7,Fmovie. Our drone flies over a state-of-
OL,8,Fthe-art BMX track that hosted
OL,9,FOlympians and the British Championship
OL,10,Fjust three years ago. Today it is
OL,11,Fabandoned.
OL,13,FThe reason it has gone to ruin since
OL,14,Fthose Championships is because Blaby
OL,15,FDistrict Council say it's too
OL,16,Fdangerous. There's an old landfill
OL,17,Fsite beneath it and too much methane
OL,18,Fgas has been coming out of it.
