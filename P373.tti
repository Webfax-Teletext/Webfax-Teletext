OL,6,FA road is melting in the heatwave,
OL,7,Fwith bits of tar sticking to tyres and
OL,8,Feven to flip flops, residents have
OL,9,Fcomplained.
OL,11,FResidents in Cannock town in
OL,12,FStaffordshire, said it is a safety
OL,13,Frisk, and it is causing expensive
OL,14,Fdamage to their tyres and driveways in
OL,15,FGorsemoor Road.
OL,17,FThe highways authority said it is
OL,18,Fseeing whether it needs to temporarily
OL,19,Fclose the road, and has been out on
OL,20,FFriday and Saturday to treat it.

OL,6,F"You're ripping up great big chunks
OL,7,Fout of the road and when you put the
OL,8,Fcar onto the drive, it's literally
OL,9,Fbringing all the tar onto the drives
OL,10,Fand it's just spreading all over

OL,13,FHe and his family have been watching

OL,17,FHe continued: "It's wrecking loads of

OL,20,Ftyre issues as well, it's condensing
