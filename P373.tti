OL,6,FAn injunction brought by Birmingham
OL,7,FCity Council to stop striking bin

OL,9,Fhas been extended indefinitely.
OL,11,FThe council said the injunction aims

OL,13,Fclear the thousands of tonnes of
OL,14,Frubbish that has built up during the
OL,15,Findustrial action.
OL,17,FIt said Unite the Union had already
OL,18,Fagreed to a consent order for the
OL,19,Finjunction to be extended, which has
OL,20,Fnow been ratified by the High Court.
