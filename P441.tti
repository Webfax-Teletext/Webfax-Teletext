OL,6,FThe Secretary of State Chris Heaton-
OL,7,FHarris had told the same programme a
OL,8,Ffew days ago that he didn't believe a
OL,9,Fborder poll would be called in the
OL,10,Fnext ten years, and that a united
OL,11,FIreland would not occur within his
OL,12,Flifetime.
OL,14,FSpeaking on Thursday morning, Ms
OL,15,FO'Neill said: "My parents and
OL,16,Fgrandparents never believed that this
OL,17,Fday would come, that this change would
OL,18,Fcome about."

OL,6,F"I think with Chris Heaton-Harris,
