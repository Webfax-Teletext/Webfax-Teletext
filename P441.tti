OL,6,FA major new cross-party Inquiry has
OL,7,Fbeen launched at Stormont on Tuesday
OL,8,Fto examine how suicide prevention
OL,9,Fservices are funded in Northern
OL,10,FIreland and whether responsibility for
OL,11,Fsaving lives is being placed too
OL,12,Fnarrowly on the health system alone.
OL,14,FThe Inquiry, launched by the All-Party
OL,15,FGroup (APG) on Suicide Prevention,
OL,16,Fwhich is supported by Samaritans as
OL,17,FSecretariat, comes as new figures
OL,18,Fconfirm that 290 deaths by suicide
OL,19,Fwere registered in Northern Ireland in
OL,20,F2024.
