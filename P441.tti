OL,6,FJoseph, who has learning difficulties,

OL,10,Fwhich so many other children without

OL,12,Fis actually getting to the poolside
OL,13,Ffrom the car park. That's where Lexi
OL,14,Fcomes in.
OL,16,FHe guides children from the roadside,
OL,17,Feasing any nerves they might have,
OL,18,Fbefore entering the water. A vital
