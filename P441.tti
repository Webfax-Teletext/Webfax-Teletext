OL,7,Fof 2022. Operating from a garage in
OL,8,FFinaghy, she and a group of dedicated
OL,9,Fvolunteers calling themselves Help Is
OL,10,FAt Hand For Those in Need NI were
OL,11,Fproviding families with clothes, food
OL,12,Fand a shoulder to cry on.
OL,14,FThese were families in the very worst
OL,15,Fof situations. It was a small
OL,16,Foperation but seeing how busy the tiny
OL,17,Fhub was, gave me the sense that this
OL,18,Fwas a project doing a huge amount of
OL,19,Fgood work.
