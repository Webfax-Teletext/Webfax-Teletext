OL,6,FThe Speaker of the Assembly, Edwin

OL,8,Fsaid: "Ken and I disagreed on many
OL,9,Fthings; Linfield, Cliftonville,
OL,10,FLiverpool, Everton, Van Morrison. His
OL,11,Ffootball taste was terrible, his music
OL,12,Ftaste was terrible, but regardless he
OL,13,Fwas a really fine gentleman and
OL,14,FNorthern Ireland is the poorer for the
