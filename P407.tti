OL,9,FDefence barrister Tasmin Malcolm said
OL,10,FForde had "always accepted" he was

OL,13,FShe said: "Undoubtedly the speed Mr

OL,6,FProsecutor Frederick Hookway observed
OL,7,Fthat small variations of the speeds
OL,8,Finvolved in the case were unlikely to
OL,9,Fhave an impact given the defendant had
OL,10,Freached "top speeds of over 140mph".
OL,12,FJudge Anthony Leonard KC adjourned
OL,13,Fsentencing until October 22 and
OL,14,Fgranted Forde continued conditional
OL,15,Fbail.
OL,17,FHe told him: "You have pleaded guilty

OL,19,Fperhaps no option other than to do so
OL,20,Fgiven the state of the evidence.
