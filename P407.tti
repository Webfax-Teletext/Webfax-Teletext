OL,6,FAn MP criticised the 'absolutely
OL,7,Fdisgusting' sight of what appears to
OL,8,Fbe raw sewage being pumped into
OL,9,FTeddington Lock in south west London.
OL,11,FSarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP
OL,12,Ffor Richmond Park, shared a video on X
OL,13,Fof what she called an 'environmental
OL,14,Fhazard'.
OL,16,FPeople living nearby found, what they
OL,17,Fclaim, was a huge build-up of raw
OL,18,Fsewage at the lock on the border of
OL,19,FKingston and Richmond.
