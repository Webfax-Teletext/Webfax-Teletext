OL,14,FThree were hit in the last week alone.
OL,16,F"One wrote off the car that hit it,

OL,19,Fthat they can withstand serious blows
OL,20,Ffrom traffic."

OL,6,FThree years ago, the speed limit in
OL,7,FHungerford Common was brought down
OL,8,Ffrom 40mph to 30mph.
OL,10,FThe 210 acre site has been preserved
OL,11,Fand is registered under several laws
OL,12,Fwhich protects it from development.
OL,14,FThe area is maintained by a charity
OL,15,Fand one of the stipulations is that
OL,16,Fthey have to keep the grass down,
OL,17,Fwhich the cattle help to do.
OL,19,FPhilip believes the answer to the
OL,20,Fissue of the collisions is traffic
OL,21,Fcalming measures.
