OL,7,Fusing a method called electrofishing.
OL,9,FIt involves wading through the water
OL,10,Fwith a metal halo which emits a low
OL,11,Flevel electric current to attract the
OL,12,Ffish.
OL,14,FFisheries team leader, Peter Gray
OL,15,Fsaid: "It doesn't harm the fish, it
OL,16,Fjust stuns them for a second, long
OL,17,Fenough for us to grab them with a net,
OL,18,Fmove them into oxygenated tanks, and
OL,19,Fthen we can move them safely
