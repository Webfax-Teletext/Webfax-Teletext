OL,6,FSevere acid reflux affects almost 20
OL,7,Fper cent of the UK population, and for
OL,8,Fsome, medical intervention can be the
OL,9,Fonly way to stop it.
OL,11,FKnown as gastro-oesophageal reflux
OL,12,Fdisease (GORD), the condition occurs
OL,13,Fwhen contents from the stomach flow
OL,14,Fback into the oesophagus ` the long
OL,15,Ftube that carries food from the throat
OL,16,Fto the stomach.
