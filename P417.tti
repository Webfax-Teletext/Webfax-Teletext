OL,6,FAs the nation marks the 80th
OL,7,Fanniversary of D-Day, two women who
OL,8,Fwere a fundamental part of the

OL,10,Fpleased to have been a part of the
OL,11,Flargest seaborne invasion in history.
OL,13,F, 103, was a mapmaker and Patricia
OL,14,FOwtram, 100, was a codebreaker, both
OL,15,Fworking for the Women's Royal Naval
