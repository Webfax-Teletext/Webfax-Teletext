OL,6,FA three-year-old penguin at a bird
OL,7,Fpark in Surrey has taken on the role
OL,8,Fof 'guide bird' for its cataract-
OL,9,Fafflicted companion.
OL,11,FStaff at Birdworld in Farnham say the
OL,12,Fduo, called 'Penguin' and 'Squid',
OL,13,Fhave been developing a "remarkable"
OL,14,Frelationship from their early days as
OL,15,Fadolescent chicks.
OL,17,FThey say Squid is often disoriented
OL,18,Fand relies on Penguin to act as her
OL,19,Feyes, after developing cataracts - a
OL,20,Fdebilitating condition that clouds the
OL,21,Flens of the eye and impairs vision.
