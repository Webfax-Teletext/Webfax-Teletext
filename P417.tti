OL,6,FThe family of a cyclist from
OL,7,FHampshire, who was killed by a driver
OL,8,Fwith poor eyesight, are joining calls
OL,9,Ffor a change in the law.

OL,12,Finjury in July 2021 when he was
OL,13,Fknocked down by an elderly driver who
OL,14,Fdid not meet the legal eyesight
OL,15,Frequirements.
OL,17,FJim, from Andover, was airlifted to
OL,18,FSouthampton General Hospital, but died
OL,19,Ffive days later.
