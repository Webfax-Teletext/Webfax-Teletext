OL,6,FSouthern Water has suffered another
OL,7,Fcredit rating downgrade, with Fitch
OL,8,Fbumping the struggling utility
OL,9,Fcompany's debt to one step above junk
OL,10,Fstatus.
OL,12,FFitch announced the move on Tuesday,
OL,13,Fciting "challenging funding
OL,14,Fconditions" and the growing risk that
OL,15,Fit will default on its debt.
OL,17,FThe ratings agency also placed
OL,18,FSouthern Water on "rating watch
OL,19,Fnegative", which means it thinks the
OL,20,Fcompany could face further downgrades.

OL,6,FFitch said the negative outlook is
OL,7,Fpartly because of the risk that Ofwat
OL,8,Fwill not allow Southern Water to raise
