OL,6,FAs war took over Europe in 1938, the
OL,7,FAnderson shelter was designed and
OL,8,Fbuilt in more than three million
OL,9,FBritish gardens to protect people from
OL,10,Fthe threat of the Luftwaffe, with
OL,11,Finformation films produced with advice
OL,12,Fabout how to use them during an air
OL,13,Fattack.
OL,15,FThe Anderson shelter is named after
OL,16,FSir John Anderson, the man responsible
OL,17,Ffor preparing air raid precautions in
OL,18,Fthe UK before World War II.
