OL,6,FScientists in Southampton have
OL,7,Fdeveloped a new test which can reduce
OL,8,Fthe time of getting a dementia
OL,9,Fdiagnosis from years to a matter of
OL,10,Fminutes.
OL,12,FThe new test, using lasers, is being
OL,13,Fhailed as a significant breakthrough
OL,14,Fin medical technology that will
OL,15,Fbenefit thousands of patients.
OL,17,FResearchers at the University of
OL,18,FSouthampton have taken ten years to
OL,19,Fdevelop a system where they shine
OL,20,Fmultiple lasers on a drop of blood.

OL,18,FWhat is different is that we are not

OL,4,Cdiagnosis after 10 years research
OL,6,FAndy and Susan Thompson, who live near
OL,7,FWinchester, endured two years of
OL,8,Funcertainty before Andy was finally
OL,9,Fdiagnosed with Alzheimer's after
OL,10,Fhaving a lumbar puncture test.
OL,12,FSusan said: "It wasn't very quick at
OL,13,Fall. After a lot of backwards and
OL,14,Fforwards, they decided to send him for
OL,15,Fa lumbar puncture, and it was almost a
OL,16,Fyear before we got the results."
OL,18,FAndy added that the new test, means he
OL,19,Fcould have received his diagnosis
OL,20,Fafter just a simple blood test, which
OL,21,Fwould have been much easier for him.

OL,6,FHe said: " (Getting a lumbar puncture
OL,7,Ftest) is a serious thing to do. It
OL,8,Finvolves having a specimen of material
OL,9,Ftaken from your body, very near to the
OL,10,Fspine. It could go horribly wrong.

OL,13,FConsultant Neurologist Professor Chris
