OL,6,FThe deathwatch beetle is continuing to
OL,7,Fcause problems onboard HMS Victory, as
OL,8,Fshe goes through a multi-year
OL,9,Frestoration project.
OL,11,FThe flagship vessel, used by Nelson
OL,12,Fhimself, is being painstakingly
OL,13,Frestored and preserved, but teams say
OL,14,Fthey are being hampered by the
OL,15,Fbeetle's fierce appetite.
OL,17,FIt's estimated there are more than ten
OL,18,Fthousand of the creatures onboard, and
OL,19,Ftheir larvae are now posing a separate
OL,20,Fproblem.
