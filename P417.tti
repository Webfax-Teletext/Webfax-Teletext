OL,6,FThe Allies faced a seemingly
OL,7,Finsurmountable hurdle on D-Day, how to
OL,8,Fland tonnes of supplies and heavy
OL,9,Fvehicles needed to push their Armies
OL,10,Fforward.
OL,12,FThere had been failed attempts to
OL,13,Fcapture French harbours that were in
OL,14,Fcontrol of the Nazis, something that
OL,15,Fput invasion plans in a spin.

OL,18,Fingenious idea to build there own
OL,19,Fharbour and take it with them.

OL,6,FRebecca Nash, Director of the Royal
OL,7,FEngineers Museum said: "Almost every
OL,8,Fdockyard in the UK was involved in
OL,9,Fbuilding some part of this harbour,
OL,10,Fthey built two harbours, roughly one
OL,11,Fand a half times the size of Dover
OL,12,FHarbour.
OL,14,F"Enormous, enormous construction that
OL,15,Fkept that army invading France
OL,16,Fresupplied."
OL,18,FMulberry was so secret that not even
OL,19,Fthe people building the pieces knew
OL,20,Fwhat it was.

OL,6,FDorothy Marsh worked at one of the
OL,7,Fplaces where the hollow blocks were
OL,8,Fbeing put together. She said: "The
OL,9,Fchippies had to go into the dockyard
OL,10,Fand build great big wooden crates.
OL,12,F"We couldn't think why they were being
OL,13,Fbuilt, but what they were doing, they
OL,14,Fwere tipping concrete into those
OL,15,Fcrates and they were actually building
OL,16,FMulberry Harbour.''
OL,18,FEven the people towing the pieces were
OL,19,Fbaffled, like Peter Orlando, a
OL,20,Fradioman on a US tugboat on D-Day.

OL,6,FHe said: "They were huge blocks of
OL,7,Fcement that were sunk in a line to
OL,8,Fsort of protect that area that turned
OL,9,Finto a landing area. But then that was
OL,10,Fit, that they had that name, Mulberry,
OL,11,Fand you'd never guess what they were
OL,12,Ftalking about.
OL,14,F"We used to tow those things around.
OL,15,FWe used to pick them up and tow them

OL,18,FGeorge Worroll from Maidstone drove

OL,20,Flater asked to test the roadways on
OL,21,Fthe harbour before it went into use.
