OL,6,FA Reform-led county council has
OL,7,Frescinded its declaration of a climate
OL,8,Femergency, with many members seeking
OL,9,Fto minimise the impacts of global
OL,10,Fwarming.
OL,12,FReform UK won 57 of the 81 seats on
OL,13,FKent County Council (KCC) in May's
OL,14,Flocal elections, and on Thursday their
OL,15,Fcouncillors argued they had the
OL,16,Fmandate to scrap net-zero policies.

OL,6,FThe motion was brought forward by

OL,8,F"nonsense" climate change science and
OL,9,Fideologies, and sought to minimise the

OL,12,FKCC Labour group leader councillor
OL,13,FAlister Brady said the declaration,

OL,15,Fbut a "serious response to a serious
OL,16,Frisk".
OL,18,F"Our leadership must be rooted in
