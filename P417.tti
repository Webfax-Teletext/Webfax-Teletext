OL,5,F"A couple of months before D-Day I was
OL,6,Ftaken across the switchboard which had

OL,6,Fmessages to pass. They were all in
OL,7,Fcode, I have no idea what they were.
OL,8,FAnd then I had to get a response from
OL,9,Fthe recipient. And when they lifted
OL,10,Fthe lever I was quite shocked.
OL,12,F"Because I suddenly realised I was in
OL,13,Fthe war. They were people who were
OL,14,Factually going onto the beaches. You
OL,15,Fcould hear gunfire, machine guns,
