OL,7,FPeople living in a town in Sussex say
OL,8,Fswarms of flies from sewage works are
OL,9,Fbecoming intolerable.
OL,11,FSouthern Water says the flies are
OL,12,Fharmless but residents in Uckfield
OL,13,Ffear new homes due to be built nearby
OL,14,Fcould make the problem even worse.
OL,16,FLocal resident Joanna Wilson said:
OL,17,F"The flies come in and we'll have the
OL,18,Fkitchen and the ceiling just full of
OL,19,Fthem. It's disgusting and obviously in
OL,20,Fthe kitchen you cook so, when the
OL,21,Fflies are bad, cooking is a nightmare."
