OL,6,F"Sadly, one bird had to be put to
OL,7,Fsleep by vets due to welfare concerns
OL,8,Fbut the rest are doing really well.
OL,9,FWe're crop feeding the birds five to
OL,10,Fsix times a day, depending on their
OL,11,Fsize, but it'll be a few weeks until
OL,12,Fthey're fully independent.
OL,14,F"Hopefully in around a month they'll
OL,15,Fbe able to venture out into an aviary
OL,16,Fwhere they can build up their
OL,17,Fstrength, work on their flying skills
OL,18,Fand generally prepare for release."
