OL,6,FThe court heard evidence from an

OL,8,FProfessor Nigel Blackwood, that he did
OL,9,Fnot believe Esan when he said his
OL,10,Ftarget could have been anyone.
OL,12,FThe prosecution's case is that Esan
OL,13,Ftargeted Lt Col Teeton because of his
OL,14,Fappearance as a soldier.
OL,16,FProf Blackwood was asked by prosecutor
OL,17,FAlison Morgan KC if he thinks Esan's
OL,18,Faccount on selecting a target was
OL,19,Funtruthful. He replied: "I think he
OL,20,Ftries to minimise choosing an Army
OL,21,Fofficer in what he has said.
