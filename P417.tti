OL,9,Fpassing out as a despatch rider and

OL,12,FHe was dropped near the River Orne
OL,13,Fwhere the Allies secured two bridges
OL,14,Fto stop the Germans destroying them
OL,15,Fand holding up the advance.
OL,17,FHe said: "We waited and at last we
OL,18,Fwere off. I had the inside of the
OL,19,Fglider up my back and a tank near to
OL,20,Fme. That was my unorthodox landing in

OL,6,F"On the way over I couldn't see
OL,7,Fanything. I thought I would climb on
OL,8,Ftop of the tank. I saw other tow
OL,9,Fplanes and gliders in the air.
OL,11,F"Then the glider pilot dropped the tow
OL,12,Frope and you're not allowed to move
OL,13,Fbecause it upsets the weight for the
OL,14,Fglider pilot.
OL,16,F"So I had to freeze on top of this

OL,18,FNormandy, spreadeagled on top of a
OL,19,FTetrarch tank in a Hamilcar glider."

OL,10,F"I was carried to a barn where we put
