OL,6,F"I was only 15 or 16. I said I will
OL,7,Fcome too and join up because I was fed
OL,8,Fup at home. So I said I was seventeen

OL,12,Ften children and I was fed up being
OL,13,Fanother mother.
OL,15,F"They asked you what you wanted to do.

OL,7,Fbothered about what was happening at
OL,8,Fthat age you know. We didn't want to
