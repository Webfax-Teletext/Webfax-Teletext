OL,13,Fafter spotting the dead starfish while
OL,14,Fwalking his two-year-old Cockapoo.JHe
OL,15,Fsaid: "I was shocked to see so many
OL,16,Fdead starfish, obviously I'm new to
OL,17,Fsuch a phenomenon such as this while
OL,18,Fout walking Olive, our two-year-old
OL,19,FCockapoo.J"I've asked around and I'm
OL,20,Fassured that it's not an uncommon

OL,22,Fit's a rather shocking sight seeing so
OL,23,Fmany. There are more of the same along
