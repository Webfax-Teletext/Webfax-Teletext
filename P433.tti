OL,6,FA student midwife from Somerset has
OL,7,Ftold ITV News she's "deeply worried"
OL,8,Fby a lack of vacancies in the
OL,9,Fmaternity sector, despite maternity
OL,10,Fservices struggling with understaffing.
OL,12,FAimee Peach, from North Petherton, is
OL,13,Fabout to start the third year of her
OL,14,Ftraining, but said the prospect of a
OL,15,Fjob at the end of her degree is
OL,16,Fminimal.
OL,18,F"I've invested my heart and soul into
OL,19,Fdoing this degree, and there are just
OL,20,Fno positions available," she said.
