OL,6,FHow do beavers affect the landscape?
OL,8,FBeavers "engineer" their surroundings
OL,9,Fby cutting down trees, building dams
OL,10,Fand digging networks of canals.
OL,12,FBeaver dams and wetlands can reduce
OL,13,Fflooding during heavy rainfall by
OL,14,Fslowing down the movement of water.
OL,15,FThey reduce "storm flows', surface

OL,17,Faverage of 30%.
