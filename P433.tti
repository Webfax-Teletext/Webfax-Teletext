OL,6,F"Driver Farm is one of our biggest
OL,7,Festates, right in the heart of
OL,8,Fmoorland and connected to an outdoor
OL,9,Feducation centre," Mr Barrett said.
OL,11,F"It had been tenanted, but the tenant
OL,12,Ffamily said they wanted to relinquish
OL,13,Fit, so ENPA members and officers
OL,14,Fdiscussed what to do with the farm,
OL,15,Fand decided, rather than securing a
OL,16,Fnew tenant, that we would try to
OL,17,Faccess various schemes to help support
OL,18,Fthe site."
