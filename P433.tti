OL,6,FClinical Director Helena Wilkes said:
OL,7,F"After being checked over by a vet and
OL,8,Fnurse, it was found that the little
OL,9,Fpuffin had no obvious injuries and
OL,10,Fappeared to be a little underweight,
OL,11,Fdehydrated and just weak from all this
OL,12,Flovely weather we've been having."
OL,14,FMs Wilkes added: "We also crop-fed the
OL,15,Fpuffin every couple of hours with a
OL,16,Ffish-based syringe feed and offered
OL,17,Fbaths of water each time.
OL,19,F"After just a night's stay, warmth,
OL,20,Ffood and water, it was already so much
OL,21,Fbrighter and was doing so well."
