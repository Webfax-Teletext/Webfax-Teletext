OL,6,FThe Bristol science museum We The

OL,8,Ftime in more than two years after a
OL,9,Fdevastating fire forced it to shut.
OL,11,FSchool children from Cornwall were
OL,12,Famong the first to return to the site.
OL,13,FThey were cheered in by staff who said
OL,14,Fit was a 'hugely emotional and
OL,15,Fimportant' day.
OL,17,FThe fire in April 2022 started on
OL,18,Fsolar panels on the roof but led to
OL,19,Fsignificant water damage after gallons
OL,20,Fof water was pumped onto the building.

OL,6,FChief executive, Donna Speed described
OL,7,Fthe last two years as "bumpy and
OL,8,Fchallenging" but said it was
OL,9,F"incredible" to reopen.
OL,11,FShe said: "It feels fantastic to be
OL,12,Fback. We have been closed for two
OL,13,Fyears and two months and we've really
OL,14,Fmissed our visitors. To see people
OL,15,Fback here is incredible."
OL,17,FIt took six months for the building to
OL,18,Fbe fully dried out after the fire
OL,19,Fbefore repairs could be carried out
OL,20,Fincluding a new roof and solar panels.

OL,6,FThe fire was caused by birds dropping
OL,7,Frocks onto some of the solar panels
OL,8,Fwhich led to a malfunction. The
OL,9,Fvisitor attraction had only been open
OL,10,Ffor ten months following the pandemic
OL,11,Fwhen the fire struck.
OL,13,FDonna Speed said: "After covid, which

OL,15,Fthat much longer when we had the fire
OL,16,Fon the roof and all the water damage.
