OL,6,FA new trial scheme to reduce "rat-

OL,10,FBristol City Council says the East

OL,13,Fthere to walk and cycle from A to B.

OL,6,FThe scheme applies to Barton Hill, and

OL,11,FNew road furniture like bus gates and

OL,10,FBus gates are similar to modal

OL,13,Fnot motorists.
OL,15,FThere isn't a physical barrier
