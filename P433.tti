OL,6,FSwimmers in Devon are campaigning to
OL,7,Fclean up the River Dart.
OL,9,FFriends of the Dart say they are fed
OL,10,Fup with the "constant stream of sewage
OL,11,Freleases, road and agricultural run-
OL,12,Foff".
OL,14,FThe Environment Agency currently tests
OL,15,Fat four sites along the 47-mile river
OL,16,Fbetween May and September.
OL,18,FThe community initiative is hoping to
OL,19,Fraise #30,000 so weekly testing can be
OL,20,Fdone at seven sites, all year round.

OL,6,FNicky Rajska, director of Friends of
OL,7,Fthe Dart, said: "Each single test, for
OL,8,Ftwo bacterias, costs #30, so if we
OL,9,Fwant to do that weekly and we want to
OL,10,Fdo that at multiple sites, that amount
OL,11,Fadds up.
OL,13,F"The testing is important is that the
OL,14,Ftesting gives accountability. It shows
OL,15,Fwhere the sewage is coming from it
OL,16,Fshows the source of it, it shows what
OL,17,Fit is.

OL,21,Fchange, this is the way to do it.
