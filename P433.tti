OL,6,FHe explained that elephants usually
OL,7,Fsleep for a couple of hours at once,
OL,8,Fthen get up and move around before
OL,9,Fgoing down for their next lot of sleep.
OL,11,F"They almost always go back to sleep
OL,12,Fon their opposite side," he said.
OL,13,F"This is because elephants are such
OL,14,Flarge and heavy animals that if they
OL,15,Fspend too long lying on one side, it
OL,16,Fcan cause pressure build-up on their
