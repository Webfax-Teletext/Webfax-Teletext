OL,8,Fpeople's understanding of the issue.
OL,10,FAmanda Wall said she and her two

OL,12,Fweeks by Bristol City Council before
OL,13,Ffinding the home she's now had for two
OL,14,Fyears.
OL,16,FShe said: "It was gruelling,
OL,17,Fdemoralising, frustrating. There was
OL,18,Fno consistency for the kids.
OL,20,F"They didn't know from one minute the
OL,21,Fnext where they would be living."
