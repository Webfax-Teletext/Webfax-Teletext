OL,10,FStaff at the Blue Reef Aquarium in

OL,14,FThey were sad to pack them off, but
OL,15,Fsay they are delighted that they now
OL,16,Fhave a new chance of thriving in
OL,17,Fwarmer waters.
OL,19,FThree of the turtles have been at the

OL,6,FFor their big journey, they were

OL,10,FAssistant Curator at the aquarium,
OL,11,FLara Heaney, explained: "Once they're
OL,12,Fin their boxes each of their crates
OL,13,Fhas got a foam bottom so it's nice and
OL,14,Fsoft, they're nice and secure. It's
OL,15,Fquite dark in there which calms them

OL,18,FThe largest is named Gordon, who was
OL,19,Ffound fighting for his life. He had a
OL,20,Fcrate made for him due to his size.

OL,6,FAbby Wheston, Senior Aquarist said:
OL,7,F"Gordon is especially rewarding to see
OL,8,Fgo back out. He came in at just over a
OL,9,Fkilo and now he's going out at eight
OL,10,Fkilos.
OL,12,F"It's even more rewarding as he had a
OL,13,Fstomach full of plastic that he passed
OL,14,Fon his own and then he got a full
OL,15,Fbelly and he's definitely grown the
OL,16,Fbiggest out of all of them who have
OL,17,Fcome out."
OL,19,FIt has taken months of paperwork and
OL,20,Fworking with government departments to
OL,21,Fget the travel organised.
