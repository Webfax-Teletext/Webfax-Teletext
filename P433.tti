OL,6,FThe Northern Lights are the result of

OL,8,Fthrow out huge bursts of energy and
OL,9,Fplasma. As these reached our

OL,6,FWhat is the Perseid meteor shower?
OL,8,FThe Perseid shower is visible when
OL,9,FEarth orbits through the debris left
OL,10,Fbehind by the Swift-Tuttle comet.
OL,12,FThe meteroids are mostly no bigger
OL,13,Fthan a grain of sand, but burn up as
OL,14,Fthey hit the Earth's atmosphere at the
OL,15,Fspeet of 36 miles per second - this
OL,16,Fthen produces a shooting stream of
OL,17,Flight in the sky.
OL,19,FThe meteors are called Perseids
OL,20,Fbecause they seem to dart out of the
OL,21,Fconstellation Perseus.
