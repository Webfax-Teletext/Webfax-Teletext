OL,6,F"A lot of people don't really think
OL,7,Fabout D-Day but it's important to know
OL,8,Fthat if it weren't for these people,
OL,9,Fwe wouldn't have the life we have
OL,10,Ftoday.
OL,12,F"I do these sorts of things for the
OL,13,Fcouncil- but this one was special.
OL,15,F"The spitfire is mainly made of
OL,16,Fplywood, like you would do with a
OL,17,Fmodel aircraft. Then I covered it with
OL,18,Fwire mesh, canvas and painted it."
OL,20,FGeoff's creation has been well
OL,21,Freceived by the community.
