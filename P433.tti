OL,6,FThe dolphin - which measured as 1.4
OL,7,Fmetres long - was thought to be a
OL,8,Frecently weaned calf.
OL,10,FAn dolphin which was found dead
OL,11,Fnearby, was thought to be the
OL,12,Fyoungster's mum.
OL,14,FFirst aid was administered and it was
OL,15,Fdecided the young dolphin was strong
OL,16,Fenough to cope without its mum.
OL,18,FA refloat was planned, but it became
OL,19,Fclear the animal could not be
OL,20,Frefloated in the location it was found
OL,21,Fin, because of the incoming tide.

OL,6,FThe dolphin and the team working with
