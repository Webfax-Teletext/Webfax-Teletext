OL,6,FA former Royal Mail postbox has been
OL,7,Finstalled at a Cornwall cemetery for
OL,8,Fpeople to post letters to their loved
OL,9,Fones in heaven.
OL,11,FThe box, called Letters to Heaven, was
OL,12,Fput up in Churchtown Cemetery in
OL,13,FSaltash after a request from local
OL,14,Fresident Helen Manley.
OL,16,FHelen's idea to introduce the postbox
OL,17,Fin her community came after the sudden
OL,18,Fdeath of her best friend, as a "gift"
OL,19,Fto her children as they cope with
OL,20,Ftheir grief.

OL,6,F"I lost my best friend very
OL,7,Funexpectedly and suddenly a few years
OL,8,Fago and she had three young children
OL,9,Fwho were completely devastated by it",
OL,10,FHelen said.
OL,12,F"My first thought was that it would be
OL,13,Fsomething nice for them to do and to
OL,14,Fwrite to their mum on special
OL,15,Foccasions.
OL,17,F"I think particularly when we go up to
OL,18,Fthe graveyard, it's lovely to see
OL,19,Fpeople have left things out for loved
OL,20,Fones - cards and pictures.
