OL,7,FLouisa Dunne was well-known in the
OL,8,Fneighbourhood of Easton in Bristol.
OL,10,FShe was a friendly face in the
OL,11,Fcommunity who would often watch the
OL,12,Fworld go by from the safety and
OL,13,Fcomfort of her doorstep.
OL,15,FShe was a mother, a grandmother and a
OL,16,Fwidow who had lost two of her husbands.
OL,18,FBut in 1967, at the age of 75, it was
OL,19,Fher life that was brutally cut short
OL,20,Fby a killer who went on to evade
OL,21,Fcapture for almost 60 years.
