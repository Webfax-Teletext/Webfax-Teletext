OL,12,Fcoming to Taunton it was really
OL,13,Fimportant that it went ahead and it's
OL,14,Fbeen such a community-led experience.
OL,15,FEvery time we go to the Knife Angel
OL,16,Fthere is somebody watching - so many
OL,17,Fpeople have come into town to see it.
OL,18,FThe biggest thing has been educating
OL,19,Fschools - so, hopefully, future
OL,20,Fgenerations will know hopefully not to
OL,21,Fcarry a knife."
