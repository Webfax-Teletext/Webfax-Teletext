OL,8,Fthe principal carers might be their

OL,10,Frespite, so they might just stay with

OL,12,Fpeople who, you know, make a home for
OL,13,Flife or as a stepping stone so for a
OL,14,Fyear, two years where they build up
OL,15,Fsome skills and in order to go and
OL,16,Flive a more independent life
