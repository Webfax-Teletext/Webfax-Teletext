OL,6,FA Cornish man says his dog "saved his
OL,7,Flife" when what's been described as a
OL,8,F"mini tornado" hit his village near
OL,9,FNewquay on Thursday 23 January.
OL,11,FStephen Jeffrey was about to take his
OL,12,Fcocker spaniel Sevi for a walk when
OL,13,Fthe strong winds hit Quintrell Downs,
OL,14,Fshortly after 9.30am.
OL,16,FHowever, the dog seemingly sensed
OL,17,Fsomething was wrong and refused to
OL,18,Fleave the house, which Mr Jeffrey said
OL,19,Fhe'd never done before.

OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV News West Country, he
OL,7,Fexplained how Sevi's strange behaviour
OL,8,Fplayed out.
OL,10,F"He had his coat on, his lead on, I
OL,11,Fopened the door and he wouldn't go
OL,12,Fout. He's never done that before. He
OL,13,Fjust wouldn't go out so I said,
OL,14,F'Alright, we're not going out'.
OL,16,F"I shut the door, walked into the
OL,17,Fkitchen, and then the tornado went
OL,18,Fpast. It was horrendous. If we'd
OL,19,Fwalked out, we'd have been straight in
OL,20,Fthe middle of it."
