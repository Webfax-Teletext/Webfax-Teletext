OL,6,FFrome is preparing to lose its last
OL,7,Fbank in a few months time.
OL,9,FThe town has grown significantly in
OL,10,Fpopularity in recent times, attracting
OL,11,Fmany people to relocate from cities
OL,12,Fsuch as London.
OL,14,FBut residents are frustrated at the
OL,15,Floss. One said: "What are they going
OL,16,Fto do with these great big buildings,
OL,17,Fbecause no one is going to want them
OL,18,Fare they?"

OL,10,FThere are still three building

OL,12,Fsame services that banks can. This
OL,13,Fmeans businesses are struggling to

OL,16,FTina Gaisford-Waller, the manager of
