OL,8,FOfficer at Cornwall Wildlife Trust,
OL,9,Fsaid: "Fortunately, the stings are not
OL,10,Fpowerful enough to harm humans or
OL,11,Fdogs, although it is not advisable to
OL,12,Ftouch them and then touch your face
OL,13,Fand eyes, as they may cause skin
OL,14,Firritation.
OL,16,F"Dogs love eating them ` they have a
OL,17,Fstrong smell of the ocean ` but I
OL,18,Fdon't think they are good for them."
