OL,7,Fcommitted to spending 50 nights
OL,8,Foutdoors in her 50th year, starting
OL,9,Fwith two very chilly nights on
OL,10,FDartmoor.
OL,12,FShe said: "I've always been outdoorsy.

OL,6,FClaire's spent two nights on the moor
OL,7,Fso far, with temperatures dipping as
OL,8,Flow as -8C. Luckily, she had her
OL,9,Fborder terrier Fitz with her, to stop
OL,10,Ffrostbite from setting in.
OL,12,F"He's very useful for keeping me warm
OL,13,F- he's like a furry hot water bottle.
OL,14,FAnd he loves camping out. When we got
OL,15,Fto the campsite he did zoomies around
OL,16,Fthe tent."
OL,18,FBut even with Fitz's company, Claire
OL,19,Fadmitted that there was a layer of
OL,20,Ffrost outside and inside the tent when
OL,21,Fshe woke up.
