OL,6,FLeo said: "I'm doing this challenge
OL,7,Ffor my nanny so she can get rid of her
OL,8,Fcancer. The money is all going to the
OL,9,Fscientists so they can make the right
OL,10,Fmedicine for my nanny."
OL,12,FHis mother, Abigail Taylor-Hudd, said:
OL,13,F"My mum went for a blood transfusion
OL,14,Fand it came back that she had some
OL,15,Fcancerous cells.
OL,17,F"They found Stage 2 bowel cancer, then
OL,18,Fthey found two tumours and then Stage
OL,19,F3 bowel cancer."

OL,6,FAbigail continued: "She's got it on
OL,7,Fher lymph nodes and she's going in for
OL,8,Fscans on her liver as well. So we
OL,9,Fdon't know what that's going to come
OL,10,Fback as. But it's just like a massive

OL,13,FLeo's grandad had decided to swim
OL,14,F50km, so Leo wanted to do his bit too.
OL,16,FEvery day, Leo will be completing 5km
OL,17,Fby making the most of the countryside
OL,18,Fand beaches near where he lives in
OL,19,FLaunceston - places he has loved
