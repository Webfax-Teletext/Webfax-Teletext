OL,11,FThe machine - which allows doctors to
OL,12,Foperate using robotic arms - has
OL,13,Falready been used in surgeries on 400
OL,14,Fendometriosis patients.
OL,16,FIt's believed an additional 144
OL,17,Fpatients will be treated every year
OL,18,Fwith the new technology, which doctors
OL,19,Fsay makes surgery less invasive and
