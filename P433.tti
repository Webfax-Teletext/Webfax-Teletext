OL,10,FSustained wet weather in January,

OL,6,FHe explained: "Even though otters are
OL,7,Fa semiaquatic mammal, when the rivers
OL,8,Fare in flood and extremely fast-

OL,10,Fthem.
OL,12,F"They don't like expending unnecessary

OL,14,Ftowards fishing lakes and ponds.
OL,16,F"If a female has cubs and she decides

OL,19,Fthey're going to get separated and the

OL,10,FThey have their cubs in underground
