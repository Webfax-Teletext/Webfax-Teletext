OL,6,F"I joined the programme nearly 25

OL,9,Fthe mindset to control my stammer.
OL,11,F"And since then all the jobs I have

OL,6,FRichard got the job of town crier
OL,7,Fafter an audition in which he read out

OL,9,Fhas changed since he was growing up
OL,10,Fwith a stammer.
OL,12,FHe added: "The 1980s and 1990s were a
OL,13,Fdifferent place to now, people did
OL,14,Fused to take the mickey out of my
OL,15,Fspeech, there was a lot of imitation,
OL,16,Fthere was a lot of laughter and finger
OL,17,Fpointing. Now it's more accepted."
OL,19,FThe British Stammering Association,
OL,20,Fnow known as STAMMA, says people like
OL,21,FRichard are inspirational.
