OL,6,FPeople in Somerset have recalled the
OL,7,F"very frightening" moment they were
OL,8,Fwoken up in the middle of the night
OL,9,Fand told to evacuate immediately due
OL,10,Fto rising floodwaters.
OL,12,FTorrential rain and overflowing rivers
OL,13,Fhas led Somerset Council and the
OL,14,Fpolice to declare a major incident on
OL,15,F27 January.
OL,17,FRelief centres have been set up in
OL,18,FChard, Illminster and Somerton as
OL,19,Fhouses were evacuated at around
OL,20,F1.30am, and many residents needed to
OL,21,Fbe taken to safety on board dinghies.

OL,6,FJillian Cope, from Somerton, found the
OL,7,Fwhole experienced scary and was
OL,8,Frescued by boat.
OL,10,FShe said: "It was very frightening at
OL,11,Fthat time of night. All of us are
OL,12,Fretired, and climbing into dinghies
OL,13,Fwhen you've got bad knees is laughable
OL,14,Freally, with the dog as well. But the
OL,15,Ffire crews and police officers, I have
OL,16,Fto say, were marvellous - but I
OL,17,Fwouldn't want to go through it again."

OL,12,FMs Terry said: "We had no warning. We

OL,15,Fthe water in the main car park was
