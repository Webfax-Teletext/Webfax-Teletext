OL,6,FA working group was set up by the

OL,11,FSociety chair Alan Purkiss said: "Bins

OL,6,FOne resident said: "There's no where

OL,9,Fcouncil has to give people something,
OL,10,Fand then if they don't use it, then
OL,11,Ffine them. You can't fine people if
OL,12,Fthere's no where to put the bins."
OL,14,FAnother resident said: "You can't help

OL,16,Fleave the bins. What happens if you're
OL,17,Faway? Your neighbours may not be happy
