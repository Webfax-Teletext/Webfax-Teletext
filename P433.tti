OL,6,FStruggling North Somerset Council has
OL,7,Fbeen granted special permission by the

OL,9,F8.99 per cent from April, almost

OL,11,Fincrease.
OL,13,FThe council had initially requested
OL,14,Fpermission to raise the tax by 10 per
OL,15,Fcent, warning that without
OL,16,F"exceptional financial support" it
OL,17,Fcould be forced to issue a section 114
OL,18,Fnotice, making it effectively bankrupt.
