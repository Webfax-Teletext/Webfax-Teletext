OL,11,Fvolume pumps that allow us to move
OL,12,Fwater out of the drains in the moors
OL,13,Finto the River Parrett and out to sea.
OL,15,F"That means we need to put quite a lot
OL,16,Fof hardware and infrastructure into
OL,17,Fplace that will move tonnes and tonnes
OL,18,Fof water every second away from
OL,19,Fcommunities which are threatened.
