OL,6,FThe Cornwall FA has expressed its
OL,7,Fconcern for the welfare of football
OL,8,Fplayers after teams across the
OL,9,Ffootball pyramid were left facing a
OL,10,Fhuge fixture pile-up as a result of
OL,11,Fpostponements.
OL,13,FClubs were severely impacted by poor
OL,14,Fweather throughout the winter and
OL,15,Fspring months, meaning a number of
OL,16,Ffixtures were called off.
OL,18,FIt has meant an incredibly congested
OL,19,Fend to the season for many, with teams
OL,20,Fhaving to play matches multiple times
OL,21,Fa week.
