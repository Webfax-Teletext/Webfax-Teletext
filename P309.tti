OL,6,FBritish astronaut Tim Peake told ITV
OL,7,FNews that in the first week back from
OL,8,Fspace the body goes through a lot of
OL,9,Fchanges as "it has to cope with
OL,10,Fgravity again" with more load on the
OL,11,Fmuscles and bones.
OL,13,FHe said it can take up to two months
OL,14,Ffor astronauts to get back to pre-
OL,15,Fflight fitness.
OL,17,FBritish reserve astronaut, Meganne
OL,18,FChristian described the sensation of
OL,19,Freturning to gravity as feeling like
OL,20,F"when a car turns a corner and you

OL,9,Fis why astronauts have to exercise up

OL,12,FShe said: "Your legs especially but
