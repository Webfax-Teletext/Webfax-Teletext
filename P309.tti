OL,4,CTories' 'un-British' Rwanda policy
OL,6,FSir John Major has criticised the
OL,7,Fprevious government's Rwanda scheme,
OL,8,Fstating it is an unsuitable policy for
OL,9,Fthe 21st century and branding it "un-
OL,10,FConservative and un-British".
OL,12,FThe former prime minister said he
OL,13,Fdislikes "intensely the way society
OL,14,Fhas come to regard immigration as an
OL,15,Fill" and warned that a Tory merger
OL,16,Fwith Reform UK would be "fatal".
