OL,12,F"Get out, now" is the message from the

OL,14,Fnationals believed to be in Lebanon.
OL,16,FThe clear preference in Whitehall is
OL,17,Fthat people get out under their own
OL,18,Fsteam while commercial flights are
OL,19,Fstill an option.

OL,6,FShould the situation deteriorate, I'm
OL,7,Ftold there are two main plans to get
OL,8,Fthe remaining Brits out.
OL,10,FThe first and best option is to use
OL,11,FBeirut airport. In that case, the
OL,12,Fgovernment would likely use charter
OL,13,Fplanes and possibly some RAF transport
OL,14,Faircraft.
OL,16,FBut if the airport, or the area around
OL,17,Fit, is unsafe the second option is to
OL,18,Fget people out by sea (there is no
OL,19,Fviable overland route).

OL,3,CHow would the UK evacuate British

OL,6,FThat is likely to involve a port
OL,7,Ffurther north, Tripoli is the most
OL,8,Fobvious possibility.
OL,10,FIn that case, Cyprus is only half a
OL,11,Fday's sailing away and 700 military
OL,12,Fpersonnel have already been dispatched
OL,13,Fthere to start preparing to receive
OL,14,Fevacuees at the UK sovereign bases.
OL,16,FThe Royal Navy already has two vessels
OL,17,Fin the region. One is RFA Mounts Bay,
OL,18,Fa large logistics vessel that is said
OL,19,Fto be able to transport up to 700
OL,20,Fmilitary personnel.

OL,7,Fwhich could take many more people on

OL,10,FThe second is HMS Duncan, a state-of-

OL,6,FOf course, if the UK is trying to

OL,8,Fthe US, France, Germany and others
OL,9,Fwill all be trying to do the same,
