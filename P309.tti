OL,6,FFor more than two years, the Gaza
OL,7,Fcoast was the one corner of the
OL,8,FMediterranean that no one was able to
OL,9,Fenjoy. But now, at long last, people
OL,10,Fare getting back into the sea.
OL,12,FIt's a risky business because the
OL,13,FIsraelis have previously issued
OL,14,Fwarnings against entering the water
OL,15,Fdue to security restrictions.
OL,17,FHowever, swimmers are taking their
OL,18,Fchances in search of solace and a
OL,19,Ftemporary escape from the trauma of
OL,20,Fwar.

OL,10,F"It turns negative energy into
