OL,6,FThe main reason this summer is on
OL,7,Fcourse to outrank 1976 and all others
OL,8,Fin terms of overall average
OL,9,Ftemperature is the "consistency of the
OL,10,Fwarmth", the Met Office added.
OL,12,FThis has been caused by a combination
OL,13,Fof factors: dry ground, thanks to
OL,14,Fextremely low rainfall in the spring;
OL,15,Fpersistent high-pressure weather
OL,16,Fsystems; and unusually warm seas
OL,17,Faround the UK.
OL,19,FThese conditions have created an
