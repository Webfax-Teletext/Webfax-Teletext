OL,7,FThe head of the Secret Service has
OL,8,Fcalled the assassination attempt on
OL,9,FDonald Trump the "most significant
OL,10,Foperational failure" for the agency in
OL,11,Fdecades.
OL,13,FKimberly Cheatle said she took "full
OL,14,Fresponsibility" for the lapses in
OL,15,FTrump's security, and vowed to "move
OL,16,Fheaven and earth" to ensure a repeat
OL,17,Fincident does not occur in the future.
OL,19,FMs Cheatle made the comments as she
OL,20,Fwas questioned by lawmakers before a
OL,21,Fcongressional hearing on Monday.
