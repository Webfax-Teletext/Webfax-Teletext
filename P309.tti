OL,8,FStrike is being remembered with the
OL,9,F"heartbreaking" testimonies of both
OL,10,Fthe strikers and those branded scabs
OL,11,Fafter they decided to return to work.
OL,13,FNext week marks 40 years since tens of
OL,14,Fthousands of mineworkers walked out in
OL,15,Fwhat became one of the defining events
OL,16,Fof late 20th century British history
OL,17,Fbut has left families and communities
