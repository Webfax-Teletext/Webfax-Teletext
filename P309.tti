OL,6,FHere's how it works: after grazing,
OL,7,Fsheep are placed in individual metal
OL,8,Fchambers for about 50 minutes. As they
OL,9,Fchew the cud, the methane they emit
OL,10,Fcan be precisely measured.
OL,12,F"I think of it as a fart chamber, but
OL,13,Fit's mostly burps, isn't it?" I asked
OL,14,FJohn Gordon, a technician from
OL,15,FScotland's Rural College.
OL,17,F"It's more burps," he confirmed.
OL,19,F"The methane we're measuring comes
OL,20,Ffrom the sheep's stomach, released
OL,21,Fthrough their mouth and nose."
