OL,7,FBy James Gray, ITV News Producer
OL,9,FA series of deadly wildfires are
OL,10,Fcontinuing to ravage communities
OL,11,Facross Los Angeles, leaving fire
OL,12,Fauthorities with the mammoth task of
OL,13,Fcontaining the blazes as soon as
OL,14,Fpossible.
OL,16,FThe fires have forced thousands from
OL,17,Ftheir homes, destroyed significant
OL,18,Fnumbers of structures and,
OL,19,Fconsequently, prompted much debate
OL,20,Fabout the preparedness of emergency

OL,7,FA definitive cause of the fires is
OL,8,Fstill being investigated, according to
OL,9,Fthe US Forest Service, but a leading
OL,10,Ftheory is a type of weather phenomenon
OL,11,Fknown as the Santa Ana winds.
OL,13,FThe Santa Anas are characterised by
OL,14,Fextreme, dry winds, typically blowing
OL,15,Ffrom the interior of Southern
OL,16,FCalifornia toward the coast and
OL,17,Foffshore.
