OL,6,FIn his column for The Daily Mail, Mr
OL,7,FJohnson said those supporting the end
OL,8,Fof arms sales were "clamouring for us
OL,9,Fto turn our backs on the only

OL,12,FHe stated that if the UK stopped arms

OL,14,Falso end their military support of
OL,15,FIsrael, therefore "willing the
OL,16,Fmilitary defeat of Israel and the
