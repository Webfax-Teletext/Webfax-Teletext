OL,8,Fof the new pope has been a particular
OL,9,Fcause of celebration, as ITV News
OL,10,FCorrespondent Robert Moore reports
OL,12,FRobert Prevost - who will be known as
OL,13,FPope Leo XIV - has been named by the

OL,17,FThe 69-year-old, from Chicago, spent

OL,8,Fof the office that vets bishop
OL,9,Fnominations, one of the most important
OL,10,Fjobs in the Catholic Church, giving
OL,11,FPrevost a prominence going into the
OL,12,Fconclave that few other cardinals had.
OL,14,FSignificantly, he presided over one of
OL,15,Fthe most revolutionary reforms Francis
OL,16,Fmade, when he added three women to the
OL,17,Fvoting bloc that decides which bishop
OL,18,Fnominations to forward to the pope.

OL,6,FIn early 2025, Francis again showed

OL,8,Fthe most senior rank of cardinals,
OL,9,Fsuggesting he would at least be
OL,10,FFrancis' choice in any future conclave.
OL,12,FOne strike against him, however, is
OL,13,Fthat he's American, and there has long
