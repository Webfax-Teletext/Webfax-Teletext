OL,13,FThe faulty Horizon system has been the

OL,7,FOn Tuesday, Mr Jenkins began giving

OL,12,FMr Jenkins was an employee of Fujitsu

OL,15,Fentirety of his career, until he

OL,7,FHe was part of the team that designed

OL,13,FOne witness who gave evidence at the

OL,17,FOn Tuesday, he was asked: "Were you

OL,10,F"Most of the time," Mr Jenkins
