OL,3,CWhy Mark Carney's victory matters to us
OL,5,FOne of Donald Trump's most significant
OL,6,Fachievements in his first 100 days is
OL,7,Fsecuring the election of arguably his
OL,8,Fmost trenchant critic, Mark Carney, as
OL,9,Fthe Prime Minister of Canada.
OL,11,FIndeed, it might just turn out to be
OL,12,Fthe most significant consequence of
OL,13,Fhis tenure, as I will explain.
OL,15,FBefore his inauguration, there was
OL,16,Fzero prospect of Carney's Liberal
OL,17,FParty escaping electoral humiliation
OL,18,For of the former Bank of England
OL,19,Fgovernor being picked to lead the
OL,20,Fparty.

OL,5,FThe Conservatives, led by someone who

OL,7,Fplaybook and rhetoric, Pierre
OL,8,FPolievre, were a shoo-in.
