OL,6,FThe founder of Dignitas, Switzerland's
OL,7,Fassisted-suicide clinic, has died aged
OL,8,F92 through assisted dying, the
OL,9,Forganisation said.
OL,11,FLudwig Minelli, a former lawyer and
OL,12,Fjournalist, died on November 29
OL,13,Fshortly before his 93rd birthday.
OL,15,F"Mr Minelli lived a life for freedom
OL,16,Fof choice, self-determination, and
OL,17,Fhuman rights," Dignitas said in a
OL,18,Fstatement.
OL,20,FHe founded the organisation in 1998
OL,21,Fwith "a group of like-minded people".

OL,6,F"At that time, he and his fellow
OL,7,Fcompatriots would never have thought
OL,8,Fthat this association was about to
OL,9,Fbecome an internationally active
OL,10,Forganisation," the statement continued.
OL,12,FThe group said Mr Minelli's core
OL,13,Fphilosophy still shapes its
OL,14,Forganisation today.
OL,16,F"Minelli recognised early on that as a
OL,17,Fmatter of principle, people with a
OL,18,Fhistory of suffering also want to
OL,19,Fcontinue living if they can find a
OL,20,Fquality of life acceptable to them
OL,21,Fpersonally," Dignitas said.

OL,6,F"Trying to talk someone out of suicide
OL,7,Fis not a suitable prevention method.
OL,9,F"Rather, the approach should be taking
OL,10,Fa person in a seemingly hopeless
OL,11,Fsituation seriously, meeting them at
OL,12,Feye level, and showing them all
OL,13,Fpossible options to alleviate their

OL,15,Fof ending their own life with
OL,16,Fprofessional support, safely and in a
OL,17,Fself-determined way in a setting that
OL,18,Fhe or she personally deems dignified.
