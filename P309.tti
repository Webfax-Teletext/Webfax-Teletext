OL,6,FResponding to the news, Ms McVey, a
OL,7,Fformer Cabinet minister, shared a post
OL,8,Fon X of Martin Niemoller's poem, which
OL,9,Fdiscusses the failure to prevent the
OL,10,FHolocaust during World War Two.
OL,12,FThe Holocaust was the systematic
OL,13,Fmurder of European Jews by the Nazis
OL,14,Fand their collaborators during the
OL,15,Fglobal conflict.
OL,17,FMs McVey's post read: "First they came
OL,18,Ffor the Communists. And I did not
OL,19,Fspeak out. Because I was not a
OL,20,Fcommunist.
