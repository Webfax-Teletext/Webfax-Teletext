OL,6,FIn 2006, the government established
OL,7,Fthe facilitated return scheme, so that
OL,8,Fit is possible to return people to
OL,9,Ftheir country of origin if they commit
OL,10,Fa crime in the UK.
OL,12,FThe main aim of the scheme was to
OL,13,Fencourage foreign national offenders
OL,14,Fto leave the UK voluntarily "at the
OL,15,Fearliest possible opportunity" to
OL,16,Freduce the costs and resources
