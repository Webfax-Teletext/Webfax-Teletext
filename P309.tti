OL,6,FSir Keir Starmer and Liz Truss may
OL,7,Fseem political and personality
OL,8,Fopposites, but the current prime
OL,9,Fminister's decision to sack the most
OL,10,Fpowerful civil servant in Britain, the
OL,11,Fcabinet secretary Chris Wormald, is
OL,12,Fredolent of her dismissal of the
OL,13,FTreasury permanent Tom Scholar.
OL,15,FBecause in both cases, Starmer and
OL,16,FTruss saw these public servants as
OL,17,Fobstacles to all the great things they
OL,18,Fwant to do as prime ministers.

OL,3,CWhat Sir Keir Starmer and Liz Truss
OL,4,Chave in common
OL,6,FThere is one important difference.
OL,7,FTruss never appointed Scholar. By
OL,8,Fcontrast, Wormald was chosen by
OL,9,FStarmer himself only just over a year
OL,10,Fago.
OL,12,FHis ousting comes against a backdrop
OL,13,Fwhere ministers routinely moan to me
OL,14,Fthat civil servants frustrate all the
OL,15,Fgreat things they want to do (they
OL,16,Falways preface their whinging with
OL,17,F"don't get me wrong, we've got some
OL,18,Fbrilliant officials").

OL,6,FColleagues of Wormald tell me that if
OL,7,Fhe had a very clear view of Starmer's
OL,8,Fpriorities, they would happen.
OL,10,FBut his chief difficulty may be
OL,11,Fprecisely those articulated by the
OL,12,Fhealth secretary Wes Streeting in his
OL,13,Fconversation with Mandelson last year
OL,14,F(which Streeting leaked) namely "there
OL,15,Fisn't a clear answer to the question:
OL,16,Fwhy Labour?".
OL,18,FThis is the question Starmer now needs
OL,19,Fto articulate succinctly and
OL,20,Fcoherently if his stay of execution is
OL,21,Fto be a permanent reprieve.
