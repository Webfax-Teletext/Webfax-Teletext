OL,13,FBut just as quickly as he had raised
OL,14,Fthe prospect, Donald Trump said he was

OL,16,FXi.
OL,18,FWhat we can read into China's response
OL,19,Fto Donald Trump's ''opening salvo'' is
OL,20,Fthat there is a desire to leave the

OL,6,FThere are two reasons behind the less-
OL,7,Fthan-proportionate response from
OL,8,FChina. The first is that due to the
OL,9,Ftrade surplus, it is running with the

OL,6,FThe fact that the tariffs imposed by
OL,7,Fthe Trump administration were 10% and
OL,8,Fnot any higher has led to the belief
OL,9,Fthat the US President might be open to
OL,10,Fa negotiation. He's currently got his
OL,11,Fteam assessing a trade deal the two
OL,12,Fcountries had agreed on, but failed to
OL,13,Fimplement, during his first term. He
OL,14,Falso still has TikTok on the chopping
OL,15,Fblock.
OL,17,FAlthough the tariffs imposed by China
OL,18,Fwere somewhat measured, Donald Trump
OL,19,Fhas been given some food for thought
OL,20,Fwith the raft of export controls China
OL,21,Fhas placed on critical minerals.
