OL,6,FStamp duty is a terrible tax. It is
OL,7,Fnot a tax on bad actions and
OL,8,Fbehaviour, the kind of tax that may
OL,9,Fhave a legitimate social purpose, like
OL,10,Fthe duty on cigarettes. It actually
OL,11,Fdiscourages activity that would be
OL,12,Fgood for the economy and good for
OL,13,Fsociety.
OL,15,FThe duty dampens the market for
OL,16,Fhouses. It discourages people from
OL,17,Fselling and buying homes.

OL,6,FAs such, it means older people stay in

OL,6,FAs it happens, the Chancellor Rachel

OL,6,FThe reform package would be revenue-
OL,7,Fneutral in the longer term, but very
OL,8,Fexpensive in the first few years
OL,9,F(because the new property wealth tax
OL,10,Fcould only be phased in). So the
OL,11,Freform is probably not affordable for
OL,12,FReeves in her forthcoming November
OL,13,Fbudget, given she has to fill a #30bn
OL,14,Fblack hole.
OL,16,FBy definition, the abolition would be
OL,17,Feven less affordable for a Tory
OL,18,Fgovernment that isn't proposing to
OL,19,Fraise an equivalent sum from an annual
OL,20,Fcharge on housing.

OL,6,FBut Badenoch is postulating #47bn of

OL,9,Fperhaps some of these cuts would be

OL,12,FAlso, she has at least four years, and

OL,16,FBadenoch has, however, done a public
