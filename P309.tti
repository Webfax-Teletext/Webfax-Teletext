OL,12,Fto address the parody sketch of the TV
OL,13,Fshow in which SNL cast member Sarah
OL,14,FSherman impersonated her using a fake
OL,15,FBritish accent and exaggerated
OL,16,Fprosthetic teeth.
OL,18,F"But whilst in honest mode ` I did
OL,19,Ffind the SNL thing mean and unfunny,"
OL,20,Fthe 31-year-old wrote, but said she
OL,21,Fmight delete the post later.

OL,6,FOne read: "Don't delete it. It was

OL,6,FIn the interview, Ms Wood explained
