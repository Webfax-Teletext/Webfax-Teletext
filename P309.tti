OL,6,FWhen Hamas terrorists launched their
OL,7,Fmonstrous assault on southern Israel
OL,8,Fin October last year, they hoped it
OL,9,Fwould be a rallying cry that would
OL,10,Fsummon other Tehran proxies to join in
OL,11,Fand batter Israel on several fronts.
OL,13,FWell, it's Israel who ended up doing
OL,14,Fthe battering and to such an extent
OL,15,Fthat Syria's Assad regime - one of the
OL,16,Fcorner stones of Iran's sphere of
OL,17,Finfluence - is now under threat.

OL,7,Fafter the Arab Spring uprising, when
OL,8,Fmore than 10 million citizens, mainly
OL,9,FSunnis, were displaced.
OL,11,FThis time, Assad's supporters who are
