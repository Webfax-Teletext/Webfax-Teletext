OL,6,FProsecutors revealed last week that
OL,7,FWeinstein had been indicted on
OL,8,Fadditional sex crime charges that
OL,9,Fweren't part of the case that led to
OL,10,Fhis now-overturned 2020 conviction.
OL,11,FBut the new indictment was sealed
OL,12,Funtil his arraignment.
OL,14,FProsecutors have said that the grand
OL,15,Fjury heard evidence of up to three
OL,16,Falleged assaults - two in hotels in
OL,17,Fthe Tribeca neighbourhood and one at a
OL,18,Flower Manhattan residential building.
OL,19,FThe purported incidents took place
OL,20,Ffrom the mid-2000s to 2016,
OL,21,Fprosecutors said.
