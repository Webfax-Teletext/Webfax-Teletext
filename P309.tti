OL,6,FDarren Jones, chief secretary to the
OL,7,FTreasury, is a fastidious minister who
OL,8,Fchooses his words carefully. So I was
OL,9,Fstruck by what he said Monday morning
OL,10,Fabout the pledges on tax his party
OL,11,Fmade in its 2024 election manifesto.
OL,13,FHe said the promise meant: "Not
OL,14,Fincreasing the headline rate of income
OL,15,Ftax or employee national insurance and
OL,16,Fnot to increase the headline rate of
OL,17,FVAT. That was a very clear promise
OL,18,Fcoming into the election."
OL,20,FThe thing is that's not what the
OL,21,Fmanifesto says. These are its words:

OL,6,FThe question is what Jones means by
OL,7,Fthe "headline rate". Does he just mean
OL,8,Fthe 20% most of us are conscious of
OL,9,Fbecause it applies to so many items,
OL,10,For is he also referring to the 0% on
OL,11,Ffood and the 5% on energy (there are
OL,12,Falso other lesser categories where the
OL,13,Frates are 5% or nil)?
OL,15,FThe point is that the chancellor could
OL,16,Fcut the main rate of VAT to, say 18%,
OL,17,Fand raise that kind of money by
OL,18,Feliminating the vast categories of our
