OL,6,FAt 10pm last night, Tory sources told

OL,8,Fbut were relieved that it looked like
OL,9,Fthey would come second, and Reform UK
OL,10,Fthird. That did happen. But the
OL,11,FConservatives only beat Richard Tice's

OL,14,FEven combined those votes would not
OL,15,Fbeat Labour's 58.9%.
OL,17,FMoreover, Labour already can point to
OL,18,Fcouncil wins in the exact places that
OL,19,Fthey will have to win in the general
