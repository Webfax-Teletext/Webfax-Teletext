OL,6,FThe first day of voting in the

OL,8,Felect a new pope as black smoke was
OL,9,Fseen rising from the Vatican chimney.
OL,11,FAs no candidate secured the necessary
OL,12,Ftwo-thirds majority, or 89 votes, the
OL,13,Fcardinals will now retire for the day
OL,14,Fbefore returning on Thursday.
OL,16,FThey will have two ballots in the
OL,17,Fmorning and then two in the afternoon,
OL,18,Feach successive day, until a winner is
OL,19,Ffound.

OL,12,FCardinals said this week they expected

OL,16,FThe first sign a new pope has been
