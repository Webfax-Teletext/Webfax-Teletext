OL,7,FThe White House defended Trump's
OL,8,Flanguage, with his press secretary,
OL,9,FKaroline Leavitt, acknowledging the
OL,10,Fpresident "gets frustrated with
OL,11,Freporters."
OL,13,FBut she insisted, "He also is the most

OL,16,FLeavitt said that his speaking to
OL,17,Freporters nearly every day - as Trump
OL,18,Fhas since taking office in January -
OL,19,Fis "a lot more respectful" than
OL,20,FDemocratic President Joe Biden, who
OL,21,Ftook questions more infrequently.
