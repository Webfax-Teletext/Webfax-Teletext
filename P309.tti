OL,7,FJames Bore is the managing director of
OL,8,FBores Group, a chartered technology
OL,9,Fand security company.
OL,11,FHe told ITV News that the "most
OL,12,Flikely" explanation for the IT outages
OL,13,Fwas an issue occurring during a live
OL,14,Fsystem update.
OL,16,F"This is the consequence of companies
OL,17,Fdeveloping massive, monolithic,
OL,18,Fincredibly complex systems, not
OL,19,Fmanaging their dependencies and not
OL,20,Fhaving proper quality testing before
OL,21,Fdeploying live," Mr Bore said.

OL,7,FAsked how often technology updates are
OL,8,Fissued, Mr Bore explained it varies,
OL,9,Fwith most companies using a software
OL,10,Fdevelopment method called Agile, which
OL,11,Fuses 'Sprints' - a time-boxed period
OL,12,Fduring which work is carried out to

OL,15,FMr Bore said: "There's always faults

OL,17,Fmore complex it is, the more updates
OL,18,Fyou're going to get because they'll be
