OL,7,F"The great majority of people with
OL,8,FADHD were never identified at school
OL,9,Fbecause they didn't fit the stereotype
OL,10,Fof a fidgety, naughty boy," he said.
OL,12,F"And we only ever diagnosed one girl
OL,13,Fto every four boys," he added.
OL,15,FDiagnostic stigma is still an issue,
OL,16,FProfessor Dommett said, while many
OL,17,Fworkplaces have "surprisingly little
OL,18,Fsupport" in place for adults with ADHD.

OL,3,C'I immediately knew': Parents

OL,7,F"So I think that's the downside -
OL,8,Funless you happen to have a very
OL,9,Fsupportive employer who's willing to
OL,10,Finvest time and probably money in
OL,11,Funderstanding what will help and what
OL,12,Fwill support you and give you
OL,13,Fflexibility. It can be quite tricky to
OL,14,Fmanage in the workplace."
OL,16,FBut that can be overcome with better
OL,17,Funderstanding, Dr Tony said.
