OL,8,Fof the war in Gaza on Tuesday,
OL,9,Fdescribing Israeli Prime Minister
OL,10,FBenjamin Netanyahu's approach to the
OL,11,Fconflict as a "mistake" and calling
OL,12,Ffor a halt to the fighting.
OL,14,F"Well, I will tell you, I think what
OL,15,Fhe's doing is a mistake. I don't agree
OL,16,Fwith his approach," Biden told
OL,17,FUnivision, in an interview taped just
