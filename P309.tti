OL,3,CStudy reveals link between menopause
OL,4,Cand women's dementia risk
OL,6,FThe menopause is linked to a loss of
OL,7,Fgrey matter in the brain, which could
OL,8,Fexplain why women are more likely to
OL,9,Fdevelop dementia than men, new
OL,10,Fresearch has revealed.
OL,12,FExperts from the University of
OL,13,FCambridge conducted a study on almost
OL,14,F125,000 women to investigate the
OL,15,Feffects of menopause on the brain.
OL,16,FThey also examined whether hormone
OL,17,Freplacement therapy (HRT) can help in
OL,18,Fpreventing cognitive decline.

OL,10,FResearchers found a significant loss
