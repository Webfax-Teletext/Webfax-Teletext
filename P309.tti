OL,7,Fflagship workers' rights legislation,
OL,8,Fto be unveiled on Thursday, would
OL,9,Finclude a probation period for new
OL,10,Femployees, but made clear it would be
OL,11,Fless than two years in length,
OL,12,Faccording to sources.
OL,14,FThey say that a sometimes testy
OL,15,Fmeeting of ministers, trade unions and
OL,16,Femployers saw bosses raise several
OL,17,Fconcerns about the inclusion of a
OL,18,Fprobation period - asking the deputy
OL,19,Fprime minister to confirm it would be
OL,20,Fincluded in the legislation.
