OL,6,FNigel Farage has faced criticism for
OL,7,Fnot offering concrete proposals on how
OL,8,Fhe would deal with the small boat and
OL,9,Fasylum seeker issue that is currently
OL,10,Fgripping our politics.
OL,12,FThat changed on Tuesday, as Farage
OL,13,Flaid out what he called a
OL,14,Fcomprehensive plan to tackle illegal
OL,15,Fmigration. Yet while the announcement
OL,16,Fgives Reform more substance, it has
OL,17,Falso raised practical and legal
OL,18,Fquestions.
