OL,9,FIt was a day that would forever change
OL,10,Fthe way party conferences are held and
OL,11,Fthe security around them.
OL,13,FWe didn't know that however, as we

OL,16,Fhighlights of the political calendar.

OL,6,FThe Thursday night of a Tory party
OL,7,Fconference, with all the business done
OL,8,Fand just the leader's speech to come
OL,9,Fin the morning, was traditionally a
OL,10,Ftime to let your hair down.
OL,12,FThere were several receptions with
OL,13,Flots of free booze and an opportunity
OL,14,Ffor journalists like me to mingle and
OL,15,Fnetwork with senior members of the
OL,16,Fgovernment and officials who could be
OL,17,Fuseful to know.

OL,6,FSo that is how I came to still be up
OL,7,Fand in a bar a few doors from the
OL,8,FGrand Hotel when an IRA bomb, planted
OL,9,Fa few weeks earlier, was detonated at
OL,10,F2.54am.
OL,12,FIt was the hotel where then Prime
OL,13,FMinister Margaret Thatcher and her
OL,14,Fgovernment colleagues were staying.
OL,16,FI actually heard the blast and walked
OL,17,Fout onto the seafront to see their
OL,18,Fhotel under a cloud of dust and
OL,19,Ffalling masonry.

OL,13,FThe tools of their trade were locked
