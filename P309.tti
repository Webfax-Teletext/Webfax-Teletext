OL,6,FThe coalition government launched two

OL,8,FDavid Cameron had one in 2016, which
OL,9,FTheresa May refreshed in 2019, and
OL,10,Fmost recently, Boris Johnson's
OL,11,Fgovernment had a Vawg strategy in 2021.
OL,13,FBut a report this year by government
OL,14,Fwatchdog the National Audit Office
OL,15,F(NAO) said efforts by previous
OL,16,Fgovernments to address the issue "have
OL,17,Fnot led to improved outcomes for the
OL,18,Fvictims of these crimes or the safety
OL,19,Fof women and girls more widely."
