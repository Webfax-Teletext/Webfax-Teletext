OL,7,FMurphy explains how Israel and the
OL,8,FLebanese militant group Hezbollah have
OL,9,Fbecome locked in a "war in all but
OL,10,Fname"
OL,12,FThe Lebanese have got used to
OL,13,Fcontinual turmoil.
OL,15,FWith a fighting force the scale of
OL,16,FHezbollah massed in its Southern
OL,17,Fterritory and Israel just over the
OL,18,Fborder, this is a region that knows
OL,19,Fwar and its cost.

OL,6,FSince October 7 the sense of
OL,7,Fvolatility has got much worse.
OL,9,FHezbollah has waged its own battles
OL,10,Fagainst Israel in support of Hamas and
OL,11,Fthe people of Gaza.
OL,13,FThe near daily backwards and forwards

OL,6,FThe reality of this situation is it is

OL,9,Fhave dwarfed its scale.
OL,11,FAway from the south of Lebanon the
