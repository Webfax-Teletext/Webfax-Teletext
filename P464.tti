OL,4,Ccriticised by Archbishop of Wales
OL,6,FThe state of Welsh rivers is a topic
OL,7,Fwhich has been dominating the
OL,8,Fheadlines in recent years with
OL,9,Fwarnings that pollution from
OL,10,Fagriculture is "killing" some
OL,11,Fwaterways.
OL,13,FNow, the Archbishop of Wales, Revd
OL,14,FAndrew John, has added his voice,
OL,15,Fcalling the abuse of rivers
OL,16,F"indefensible".
