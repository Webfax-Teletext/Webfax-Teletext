OL,7,FColombia, Ollie was mugged by a
OL,8,Fmachete-wielding gang, who took his
OL,9,Fmoney, clothes and supplies. It was
OL,10,Fonly the kindness of locals, who
OL,11,Fsupplied him with a new phone, which
OL,12,Fmeant he was able to complete his trek.
OL,14,FOllie said: "I've walked through
OL,15,Fdeserts, jungles, rainforests, and
OL,16,Fclimbed mountains with 6 thousand feet
OL,17,Fof elevation. That is what drew me to
OL,18,Fthe Andes, just how diverse it was.
OL,19,FIt's been brutal at times, altitude
OL,20,Fsickness, minus 20 degrees at night."
