OL,12,Fweighs on him every day.
OL,14,FDementia has haunted his family for

OL,16,Fdiagnosed with the condition in her
OL,17,Fearly fifties and died last year aged
OL,18,Fjust 58. Jill's mother also died of
OL,19,Fdementia and there's a strong history
OL,20,Fof the illness in the family.
