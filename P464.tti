OL,5,FNatural Resources Wales responded to
OL,6,Fthe incident and found signs of
OL,7,Fpollution but could not identify the
OL,8,Fsource.
OL,10,FThey concluded the cause of the
OL,11,Fpollution was likely paint entering
OL,12,Fthe stream from a nearby surface or a
OL,13,Fmisconnected drainpipe.
OL,15,FIn a statement, they urged people to
OL,16,Fdispose of paint properly: "If you're
OL,17,Fdoing any DIY jobs, please remember to
OL,18,Fdispose of paint correctly. Do not
OL,19,Fpour paint down the drain, as surface
OL,20,Fwater drains often run straight into
OL,21,Fnearby watercourses without treatment."
