OL,6,FThe Welsh Government has announced a
OL,7,Fbig change to the way it responds to
OL,8,Fthe most serious 999 calls saying more
OL,9,Flives will be saved.
OL,11,FIt's in response to the Senedd's
OL,12,FHealth and Social Care Committee,
OL,13,Fwhich found existing targets are no
OL,14,Flonger appropriate or fit for purpose.
OL,16,FThe changes apply to people who are in
OL,17,Fimmediately life-threatening
OL,18,Fsituations and has had success in
OL,19,FIreland, Scotland and Australia where
OL,20,Fsurvival rates and outcomes have
OL,21,Fimproved as a result.

OL,13,FThe current target for the priority

OL,15,Frespiratory arrest is 8 minutes.
OL,17,FIt means if an ambulance arrived later

OL,19,Fsurvived, it is considered a fail.
