OL,6,FHe said, "Believe me, Saturday
OL,7,Fdetention is a huge hassle for me and
OL,8,FI don't want to be here on a Saturday
OL,9,Feither, but there needs to be
OL,10,Fconsequences for poor behaviour."
OL,12,FAt the start of his time in post, some
OL,13,Fparents complained about him sending
OL,14,Fgirls home for the length of their
OL,15,Fskirts. Mr Ebenezer denies claims that
OL,16,Fhe had been measuring skirts with a
OL,17,Ftape measure.

OL,8,Fhairstyles, all sorts. And some of
OL,9,Fthat coverage has polarised opinion.
OL,11,F"I've been in the press a lot over the
