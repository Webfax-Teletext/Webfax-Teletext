OL,10,Fhave absolute empathy with those whose
OL,11,Fenjoyment is affected as a result.
OL,13,F"Our current alternate kit is black,
OL,14,Fand we have used green in the recent
OL,15,Fpast. Neither of these examples
OL,16,Fparticularly help with this issue, and
OL,17,Fadditionally, the colour red in Wales
OL,18,Fis not just traditional, but a part of
