OL,6,FThe WRU says it "does not see the
OL,7,Fsystem continuing with the current
OL,8,Fmodel of four equally funded regional
OL,9,Fclubs in the senior men's game,"
OL,10,Fadding the current setup "isn't

OL,13,Fsustainable given the likely
OL,14,Finvestment required".
OL,16,FThey went on to say they are
OL,17,F"considering a more radical strategy
OL,18,Ffocused on maximising investment and
OL,19,Freforming the whole structure of
OL,20,Fprofessional rugby in Wales."
