OL,3,CWelsh Highland Railway hit by landslide
OL,5,FThe damage was discovered on Friday
OL,6,F(19th December) during a routine
OL,7,Finspection of the line, conducted
OL,8,Fbefore scheduled trains were due to
OL,9,Frun.
OL,11,FPaul Lewin, Director and General
OL,12,FManager, said the area had a history
OL,13,Fof land movement due to its proximity
OL,14,Fto a river, but noted that previous
OL,15,Freinforcement work had helped mitigate
OL,16,Fthe damage.
OL,18,F"But that has not prevented a torrent
OL,19,Fof slurry-like mud from being
OL,20,Fdeposited on the line during the
OL,21,Fintense rainstorm," Mr Lewin said.
