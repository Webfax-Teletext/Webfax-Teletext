OL,7,FMy dad liked a bet, but in those days
OL,8,Fhe'd have a football or a horse bet,
OL,9,Fand that would be it. The betting shop
OL,10,Fshut at five, after the last race had
OL,11,Ffinished. It's not like now, when it's
OL,12,F24/7.
OL,14,FMy first bet was my first wages when I
OL,15,Fwas 16 as an apprentice at Arsenal. I
OL,16,Fwent into the betting shop with my
OL,17,Ffirst wage packet, #100. It was like
OL,18,Fbeing in a spaceship. I gambled the lot
OL,19,Fon the horses ` this was a Friday
OL,20,Fafternoon so there was no football, not
OL,21,Flike now.
