OL,6,FAs a small boy, I had no idea how my
OL,7,Flife was going to change, from being
OL,8,Fcarefree to becoming reliant on
OL,9,Fhospitals. I was born with a condition,
OL,10,Fwhich wasn't really diagnosed until I
OL,11,Fwas 7. Within those the first seven
OL,12,Fyears, the damage to my kidneys had
OL,13,Fbeen done.
OL,15,FThese days it's known as renal reflux:
OL,16,Fthe abnormal flow of urine from your
OL,17,Fbladder back up the tubes (ureters)
OL,18,Fthat connect your kidneys to your
OL,19,Fbladder, which means there's a
OL,20,Frestriction somewhere causing the
OL,21,Fdamage.
