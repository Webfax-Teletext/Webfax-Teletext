OL,7,FResidents in an old mining village in
OL,8,FCounty Durham have told ITV News Tyne
OL,9,FTees they are "not very confident" a
OL,10,Fregeneration masterplan in the area
OL,11,Fwill succeed.
OL,13,FHorden had been put forward by Durham
OL,14,FCounty Council as part of a bid for
OL,15,FLevelling Up funding in 2023. The bid
OL,16,Fwould have brought #20m into the
OL,17,Fvillage for regeneration, but it was
OL,18,Frejected.
