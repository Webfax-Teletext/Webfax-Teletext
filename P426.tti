OL,7,FHIV after receiving contaminated blood
OL,8,Fproducts says she has still not been
OL,9,Fable to grieve for him, more than 30
OL,10,Fyears after his death.
OL,12,FEmma Frame's childhood was completely
OL,13,Fovershadowed after learning her father
OL,14,FJeffrey had been infected, and knowing
OL,15,Fthat he would die.
OL,17,FMs Frame, who lives on South Tyneside,
OL,18,Fwas 11 when she discovered the HIV
OL,19,Fvirus had been passed to her father,
OL,20,Fwhen he was given contaminated blood
OL,21,Fproducts to treat severe haemophilia.

OL,8,Fhepatitis C viruses between 1970 and

OL,13,FNow, a long-awaited
OL,15,FMs Frame became aware of her father's

OL,18,FShe had been watching a children's TV

OL,13,FIn the 1980s, social attitudes around
