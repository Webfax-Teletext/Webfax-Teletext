OL,6,FA man from County Durham says being
OL,7,Finfected with contaminated blood as a
OL,8,Fchild "changed the life that I could
OL,9,Fhave had".
OL,11,FNow Mark Fox is calling for those
OL,12,Fresponsible for key decisions to be
OL,13,Fmade personally accountable.
OL,15,FMr Fox understands he was infected
OL,16,Fwith hepatitis C around the age of
OL,17,Ffour though he was in his late teens
OL,18,Fbefore he received the diagnosis,
OL,19,Fwhich came as a huge shock.

OL,8,Fand its repercussions, have affected

OL,10,FMr Fox was born with the bleeding
