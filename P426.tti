OL,6,FThe collection, which serves as a
OL,7,Frecord of Britain's role in global
OL,8,Ftrade and its colonial reach in the
OL,9,Flate 18th century, was the passion of
OL,10,FBridget Atkinson (1732-1814).
OL,12,FShe never left Britain, and rarely
OL,13,Fleft Cumbria, but amassed more than
OL,14,F1,200 shells from across the globe.
OL,16,FThe collection was inherited by her
OL,17,Fgrandson, John Clayton (1792-1890),
OL,18,Fbefore being sold along with the
OL,19,FClayton estate in 1930.
