OL,14,Fartificial nesting bank at the site

OL,6,FReserve manager John Gowland said:
OL,7,F"There were lots of positive signs
OL,8,Fearly on, with nesting material such

OL,10,Finto the nesting chambers of the
OL,11,Fartificial bank` all good signs of the
OL,12,Fbirds beginning to settle and breed.
OL,14,F"Since the first chick was spotted,
OL,15,Fwe've spent some time observing the
OL,16,Fbank to look for more and are thrilled
OL,17,Fto have seen at least eight chicks at
OL,18,Fdifferent openings, which is great to
OL,19,Fsee!"

OL,6,FSand martins will typically lay four
OL,7,Fto five eggs between late May and
OL,8,Fearly June, taking around two weeks to
OL,9,Fincubate and hatch.
OL,11,FIf conditions are right, the birds
OL,12,Fwill have two broods each year,
OL,13,Fmeaning staff at the centre could see
OL,14,F60-70 fledglings from only eight
OL,15,Fbreeding pairs.
OL,17,FIn the weeks to follow, the chicks
OL,18,Fwill receive regular feeding from both
OL,19,Fparents, dining on a diet of tiny
OL,20,Finsects before getting ready to take
OL,21,Ftheir first flight.

OL,6,FJohn added: "If they manage to
