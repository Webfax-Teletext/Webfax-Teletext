OL,8,Falmost one week - with no confirmation
OL,9,Fon when, or if, it will reopen.
OL,11,FThe Gateshead flyover was shut on
OL,12,FFriday 13 December after serious
OL,13,Fconcerns about its safety were raised
OL,14,Fduring an inspection by engineers.
OL,16,FSince then, Gateshead Council has said
OL,17,Fit wants to demolish the structure,
OL,18,Fused by around 40,000 vehicles a day,
OL,19,Fand completely "reconfigure" the area.

OL,15,FThere is no definite answer at the
