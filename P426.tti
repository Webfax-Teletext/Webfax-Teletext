OL,10,Fincredible things. To leave their
OL,11,Ffamilies, sometimes in the dead of

OL,13,Fand the do it like it's nothing.
OL,15,F"I wanted to find out just who these
OL,16,Fpeople were and what drives them.
OL,18,F"As the project went on, it changed a

OL,11,For someone told me how their family
