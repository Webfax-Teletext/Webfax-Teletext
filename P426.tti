OL,6,FThe effects of the company's collapse
OL,7,Fwere felt across the North East,
OL,8,Fparticularly by construction firm
OL,9,FPremier Plant and Civil Engineering.
OL,10,FThey lost months of work practically
OL,11,Fovernight while still being owed over
OL,12,F#900,000 by Tolent.
OL,14,F"It was quite surreal at the time
