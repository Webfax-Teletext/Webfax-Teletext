OL,6,FDr West said: "Taylor's accent changes
OL,7,Fbetween her country and pop music
OL,8,Fstyles has generated quite a lot of
OL,9,Fpublic attention, but until our
OL,10,Fresearch, had not been analysed in any

OL,12,Fstylisation dependent on the musical
OL,13,Fgenre Swift performs, with southern
OL,14,FAmerican English accent forms more
OL,15,Fprevalent in her earlier country-style
OL,16,Fmusic.
OL,18,F"Her popular-style performances

OL,6,FTheir original assumption was that
OL,7,FTaylor Swift was "performing" when she
OL,8,Fsung in a southern accent, but their
OL,9,Fanalysis found the changes are very

OL,13,FEsther Humphries said: "The changes
OL,14,Fcould be attributed to a range of
OL,15,Ffactors including her emersion into
OL,16,Fthe Nashville/South American English
