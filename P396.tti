OL,6,FA police boss is facing calls to

OL,8,Fschoolgirls wearing "very short

OL,11,FJohn Dwyer, Cheshire's Police and
OL,12,FCrime Commissioner, made the comments
OL,13,Fduring a discussion about violence and
OL,14,Fabuse of women and girls.
OL,16,FHe was reported to have told Culcheth
OL,17,Fand Glazebury parish council: "I
OL,18,Fnotice schoolgirls in my area are all
OL,19,Fwearing very short skirts and this did
OL,20,Fnot happen in the 1960s."
