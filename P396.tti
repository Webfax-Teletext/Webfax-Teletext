OL,6,FA survivor of the Summerland fire has
OL,7,Fdescribed the moment he escaped from
OL,8,Fthe blaze as "terrifying", saying he
OL,9,Fcould "feel the heat" as he carried a
OL,10,Fchild over a wall to safety.
OL,12,FBob White from Prescot, in Knowsley on
OL,13,FMerseyside, was 20 years old when he
OL,14,Fescaped the burning leisure complex in
OL,15,Fthe Isle of Man.
OL,17,FHe was on holiday in Douglas with his
OL,18,Fthen fiance, Ann, when the pair

OL,7,FBob said: "We'd heard a lot about it,
OL,8,Fbut we'd never actually been there, so
OL,9,Fit gave us an opportunity to kill a

OL,12,F"There was an organist playing, there
