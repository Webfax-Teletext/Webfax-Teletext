OL,8,Fattic of his old school, despite

OL,11,Fa "terror."
OL,13,FThe Beatles singer spent five years at
OL,14,Fwhat was then called Quarry Bank High
OL,15,FSchool in Liverpool between 1952 and
OL,16,F1957.
OL,18,FIt was where he formed The Quarrymen,

OL,6,FTom Barry, who works at what is now

OL,8,Fthere had long been rumours that
OL,9,FLennon's desk was still in the

OL,12,FHe said: "When I started here I said I
OL,13,Freally need to see this, and it was
OL,14,Fwritten on in Sharpie, so it wasn't
OL,15,Fhis."
OL,17,FTom and a colleague then gained access
OL,18,Fto the loft of the school, which had
OL,19,Fbeen used primarily as a dumping
