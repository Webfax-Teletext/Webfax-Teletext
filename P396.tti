OL,6,FAnimal Rescue Officer David Cottingham
OL,7,Fsaid: "This was a very upsetting
OL,8,Fsituation. These exotic animals had
OL,9,Fclearly been left behind without
OL,10,Fproper care or concern.
OL,12,F"Tarantulas require specific housing,
OL,13,Ftemperature, and humidity levels to
OL,14,Fsurvive - conditions that had clearly
OL,15,Fnot been met. It's lucky we were able
OL,16,Fto save the four that we did."
OL,18,FCottingham found plastic tubs without
OL,19,Fsecure lids scattered across the floor
OL,20,Fof the residence.
