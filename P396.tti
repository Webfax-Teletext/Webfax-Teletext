OL,7,FA Debenhams Group spokesperson said:
OL,8,F"Following a strategic review, we are
OL,9,Fproposing the potential closure of our
OL,10,FBurnley distribution centre in early
OL,11,F2026, with operations gradually
OL,12,Ftransferring to Sheffield, which could
OL,13,Foffer greater capacity and

OL,16,F"This is not a proposal we put forward
OL,17,Flightly, but we believe it may be
OL,18,Fimportant for the long-term health of
OL,19,Fthe business and for delivering our
OL,20,Fnew strategy.
