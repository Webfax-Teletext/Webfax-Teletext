OL,13,FAfter her death, Cathy's family
OL,14,Fadopted a tree on the 12 acres of

OL,12,FChief Executive Mike Parr said:

OL,14,Fwe are a charity, we get around a
OL,15,Fthird of our funding from the NHS but
OL,16,Fthe bulk comes from the community,
OL,17,Ffrom fundraising and donations.

OL,6,F"If you look at the mathematics, we

OL,8,FI would never want to be 100% funded

OL,12,FDespite the tough conditions, Mike
OL,13,Fremains confident the hospice will

OL,17,FHe said: "Right now, arguably it's
OL,18,Fharder than ever... but if we look at
OL,19,Fwhere we started in 1974, (our
OL,20,Ffounder) faced a huge challenge
