OL,7,FA senior coroner concluded on Friday
OL,8,F21 March that Ida died from a lack of

OL,13,FHM Senior Coroner for Lancashire Dr
OL,14,FJames Adeley said Ida's death was
OL,15,Fcontributed to by the lead midwife's
OL,16,F"wholly incompetent failure" to give
OL,17,Fbasic neonatal resuscitation.
OL,19,FHe also also identified eight missed
