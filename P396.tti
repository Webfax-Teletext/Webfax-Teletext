OL,8,Ftime I had both my legs.
OL,10,F"A couple of years after that, I lost
OL,11,Fmy leg...I had my leg amputated.
OL,13,F"Two years after that, Ninja Warrior
OL,14,FRace for Glory was casting."
OL,16,FMat could have made the choice to keep
OL,17,Fhis leg, but the majority of those who

OL,19,Fthem amputated at one point or another.

OL,5,F"For me it was very, very black and

OL,7,Fsaw if I kept it was gonna hold me
OL,8,Fback for the rest of my life," he said.
OL,10,FMat became the first ever amputee to
OL,11,Fget up the 14 foot wall - it took him
OL,12,Ftwo attempts before his amputation,
OL,13,Fbut just one afterwards.
OL,15,F"Previously a lot of amputees going on
OL,16,Fthe show and doing the course - a lot
OL,17,Fof them never wore a prosthetic," he
