OL,5,FThat is why learning how to talk about
OL,6,Fsuicide has the power to save lives,
OL,7,Faccording to the Greater Manchester
OL,8,Fcharity Shining A Light on Suicide.
OL,10,FSuicidal thoughts may come and then
OL,11,Fdisappear for some people, others
OL,12,Fmight experience them for years or
OL,13,Fhave feelings bubble up in response to
OL,14,Fchanging moods or life events.
OL,16,FShould suicide prevention be taught in
OL,17,Fschools? We ask the question in our
OL,18,Fpodcast, From the North

OL,3,CWords matter: How to talk about suicide
OL,5,FOne of the main issues with talking
OL,6,Fabout suicide is the words people use
OL,7,Fcommonly to describe a person taking
OL,8,Ftheir own life.
OL,10,FJudd explains: "People are still
OL,11,Ftalking about 'committing suicide'.
OL,12,FIt's not been a crime since 1961 but
OL,13,Fit gives people a sense of judgement.
OL,15,F"Terms like 'you're not going to do
OL,16,Fsomething silly, are you?' These are
OL,17,Fterms that people use without bad
OL,18,Fintent but make others feel like they
OL,19,Fcan't open up to that person.
