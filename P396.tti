OL,8,Ftrauma and loss is a 'taboo' topic
OL,9,Fthat many feel too uncomfortable to
OL,10,Fdiscuss.
OL,12,F"I almost tailor my language to fit my
OL,13,Faudience so it's not so abrupt,
OL,14,Fbecause it can be difficult for some
OL,15,Fpeople," Louise said.
OL,17,F"But when I'm sat here with you guys I
OL,18,Fcan say 'Isla died'. I feel a sense of

OL,20,Fbunch of ladies who have come out to
OL,21,Ftell their stories with strength."
