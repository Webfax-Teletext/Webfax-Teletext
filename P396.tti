OL,7,Fnotched up his first ranking title in
OL,8,Fthe Players Championship event in .
OL,10,FBut the tournament has proved a little
OL,11,Fcontroversial, with a former World

OL,6,FIt has left people wondering whether
OL,7,FPrice ` who is known as the 'Ice Man'
OL,8,F` was beginning to freeze.
OL,10,FAt the time he pulled out, Price was
OL,11,Ftrailing 4-2 against Brendan Dolan in
OL,12,Fa best-of-11 encounter. His exit let
OL,13,FDolan through to the next round.
OL,15,FJoe Williams, a reporter for Darts

OL,18,FHe said: "He wasn't the only one to
