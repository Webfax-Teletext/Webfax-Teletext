OL,6,FThe Summerland disaster is the Isle of
OL,7,FMan's greatest tragedy.
OL,9,FA total of 50 people died, and 80 more
OL,10,Fwere seriously injured, after a fire
OL,11,Fspread through the island's leisure
OL,12,Fcomplex on 2 August 1973.
OL,14,FIt was, at the time, the worst

OL,16,Fdisaster since the blitz, and many who
OL,17,Fsuffered feel the catastrophe has
OL,18,Fnever been truly recognised.

OL,6,FThe blaze has been widely recognised

OL,11,FOf the 50 who tragically died, 11 of
OL,12,Fthem were under the age of twenty.
OL,14,FHow did the fire start?
OL,16,FThe fire was sparked by three young
OL,17,Fboys from Liverpool who were smoking
OL,18,Fin a small disused kiosk at around
OL,19,F7.30pm on 2 August 1973.

OL,6,FA discarded cigarette caused the kiosk
OL,7,Fto catch fire, which then collapsed

OL,11,FFlames then spread undetected up the
OL,12,Finside of flammable cladding called

OL,15,FRemarkably, during this time there was
OL,16,Fno attempt to evacuate the 3,000
OL,17,Fpeople inside.
OL,19,FThis was until visible flames appeared

OL,11,FThe fire then caught on a material

OL,6,FIt found the primary cause of the
OL,7,Fdisaster was due to the use of non
OL,8,Ffire-resistant materials, including
OL,9,FGalbestos, being used on the external
OL,10,Fwall.
OL,12,FFlames spread up a 12-inch gap between
OL,13,Fthe external wall and the internal
OL,14,Fcombustible fibreboard wall which
OL,15,Fcaused the flames to build in
OL,16,Fintensity.
OL,18,FThe fire then continued up to the roof
OL,19,Fcausing the Oroglas panels to fall out
OL,20,Fof their frames.

OL,11,FThe report highlighted how quick

OL,13,Fonce it had been heated by other

OL,16,FIt also concluded that the high number
