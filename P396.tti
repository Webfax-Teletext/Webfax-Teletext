OL,6,FThe inquest heard that Mr Gibson
OL,7,Fworked in a timber yard and was
OL,8,Fphysically fit but had been suffering
OL,9,Ffrom a stomach bug, including cramps
OL,10,Fand diarrhoea, for around three weeks
OL,11,Fbefore his death.
OL,13,FIt culminated in him attending the A&E
OL,14,Fat Wythenshawe Hospital on 27 May 2023.
OL,16,FHe was seen by Dr Oliver Handley, who
OL,17,Frecognised his ECG trace showed signs
OL,18,Fof an abnormality and referred it to a
OL,19,Fmore senior medic, Dr Thomas Bull, the
OL,20,Fmedical registrar, for a second
