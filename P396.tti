OL,7,F"It is very, very hard to come to
OL,8,Fterms with. To constantly see self-
OL,9,Fpreservation, denial, othering of the
OL,10,Fvictim, and just a massive effort -
OL,11,Feffort that could have been put in to
OL,12,Fpreventing an incident - put into

OL,15,FProf Easthope spoke to Granada as

OL,9,FThey often know exactly what

OL,14,F"They understand these events are
