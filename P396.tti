OL,6,FJoey Barton "needs to find himself a
OL,7,Fdifferent hobby", Jeremy Vine has said
OL,8,Fafter the former football manager was
OL,9,Faccused of "undermining" a libel
OL,10,Fsettlement with the broadcaster.
OL,12,FVine had sued the former footballer
OL,13,Ffrom Liverpool for libel and
OL,14,Fharassment over nine online posts,
OL,15,Fincluding where he falsely called the
OL,16,FBBC Radio 2 presenter a "big bike
OL,17,Fnonce" on X, formerly Twitter.
