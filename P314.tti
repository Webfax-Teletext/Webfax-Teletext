OL,6,FWhat this MP and several others have
OL,7,Ftold me is that whips, led by Sir Alan
OL,8,FCampbell, have been warning 10 Downing
OL,9,FStreet officials for weeks that the
OL,10,FUniversal Credit and Personal
OL,11,FIndependence Payments Bill is hated by
OL,12,Flarge numbers of their own side, and
OL,13,Fthey have been ignored.
OL,15,FKeir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan
OL,16,FMcSweeney, told them that the data
OL,17,Fshowed the reforms were popular with
OL,18,Fvoters, that Labour MPs should toughen
OL,19,Fup, and the government was pressing
OL,20,Fahead regardless - according to

OL,10,Fto make the welfare state more

OL,13,FOne part of the crisis is - according
OL,14,Fto several MPs - that the whips are
OL,15,Fsaying that their jobs have become
OL,16,Fimpossible. There is talk of the prime
