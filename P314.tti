OL,6,FThe Nobel Prize in physics has been
OL,7,Fawarded to Geoffrey Hinton and John
OL,8,FHopfield, who are considered to be
OL,9,Fpioneers of artificial intelligence.
OL,11,FThe men were given the award for
OL,12,Fhelping to create the building blocks
OL,13,Fof machine learning, which they said
OL,14,Fare revolutionising the way we work
OL,15,Fand live, but also creating new
OL,16,Fthreats to humanity.
OL,18,FMr Hinton's work has earned him the
OL,19,Fmoniker "the Godfather of AI".
