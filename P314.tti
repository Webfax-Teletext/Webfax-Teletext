OL,7,FIn an interview with ITV News in 2014,
OL,8,FMaharaj said: "I am ashamed to say
OL,9,Fthat I used not to spare a thought for
OL,10,Fthose in prison. I was rich. I had
OL,11,Feverything life could offer. I did not
OL,12,Fappreciate just how fortunate I was."
OL,14,FReflecting on his conviction, he said
OL,15,Fhe was so shocked he actually fainted
OL,16,Fas he "could not comprehend what had
OL,17,Fhappened". Despite decades without his
OL,18,Fliberty, he said he did not blame the
OL,19,Fjurors, as they were "duped" by the
OL,20,Ftrial.
