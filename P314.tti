OL,8,Fto immediately carry out "powerful

OL,11,FNetanyahu made the announcement
OL,12,Fshortly after Israel said that Hamas
OL,13,Fhad opened fire at Israeli forces in
OL,14,Fsouthern Gaza.
OL,16,FTensions were already high after Hamas
OL,17,Freturned a set of remains that Israel
OL,18,Fsaid belonged to the body of an
OL,19,FIsraeli hostage recovered earlier in
OL,20,Fthe war.

OL,12,FThe IDF released a statement saying:
