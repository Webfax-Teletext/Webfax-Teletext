OL,6,FBetween 1970 and 1991 it's thought up
OL,7,Fto 30,000 people were infected with
OL,8,FHIV and Hepatitis C after they were
OL,9,Ftreated with contaminated blood.
OL,11,FThe UK started making breakthrough
OL,12,Ftreatments for conditions like
OL,13,Fhaemophilia, which was made from
OL,14,Fdonated blood.
OL,16,FBut there wasn't enough capacity to
OL,17,Fmeet demand for the new drugs, which
OL,18,Fmeant lots of blood needed to be
OL,19,Fdonated from the US.

OL,12,FThe blood donated was then pooled
OL,13,Ftogether to make the drugs, which

OL,17,FThere were numerous warnings about the
