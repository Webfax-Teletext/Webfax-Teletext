OL,6,FI felt sorry for him, actually,
OL,7,Fdelivering a really important speech
OL,8,Fwhile getting literally soaked.
OL,10,FMeanwhile, blaring in the background
OL,11,Fyou could hear the New Labour anthem -
OL,12,FThings Can Only Get Better by D:Ream,
OL,13,Fa song loved by Tony Blair in the run-

OL,6,FWhat I could pick up, was that he is

OL,8,Fthat the country faces - security,
OL,9,Findustrial and economic challenges;
OL,10,Fartificial intelligence; and global
OL,11,Fissues from Russia and China, to the

OL,14,FSunak wants to persuade the British

OL,17,Funveil any exciting new policies or

OL,6,FHe said, and it's pretty reasonable to
OL,7,Fsay this, that he inherited an
OL,8,Fincredible crisis in the economy - and
OL,9,Fthat is true - but it is a crisis that
OL,10,Fwas created by his immediate
