OL,6,FRobert F Kennedy Jr has claimed he

OL,11,FWhen city authorities first found the

OL,6,FSpeaking in a video posted on social
OL,7,Fmedia on Sunday, Kennedy, the son of
OL,8,FRobert F Kennedy and nephew of
OL,9,Fpresident John F Kennedy, said he was
OL,10,Frecounting the story to get ahead of a
OL,11,FNew Yorker article - which he expects
OL,12,Fto be damaging - on the topic.
OL,14,FThe independent US presidential
OL,15,Fcandidate said he was heading to a
OL,16,Ffalconry excursion with friends when a
OL,17,Fwoman driving ahead of him hit and
OL,18,Fkilled the young bear with her vehicle.
