OL,6,FITV News' Science Correspondent,
OL,7,FMartin Stew explains what is behind
OL,8,Fthe rise in tick numbers.
OL,10,FTicks are tiny eight-legged arachnids
OL,11,Fwhich live in grass, bracken and
OL,12,Fbrambles.
OL,14,FFor most of the year, they lie
OL,15,Fdormant, but for several weeks, they
OL,16,Fcome out to breed and feed on blood.
OL,17,FTheir bites can spread Lyme disease.

OL,11,FFor 15 years, researchers from the UK

OL,7,Fincrease in wild deer, which are at
OL,8,Ftheir highest number in 1,000 years,
OL,9,Fand our changing climate.
OL,11,FDeer act as hosts for the insects, and
OL,12,Fas the animals move into urban areas

OL,16,F"Climate change is changing the

OL,8,FLyme disease is a bacterial infection
OL,9,Fthat can be spread to humans by

OL,15,FA circular or oval shape rash around a
OL,16,Ftick bite can be an early symptom of
