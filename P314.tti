OL,8,FO'Donnell by saying he is considering

OL,11,FWriting on his Truth Social platform,
OL,12,FTrump said: "Because of the fact that
OL,13,FRosie O'Donnell is not in the best
OL,14,Finterests of our Great Country, I am
OL,15,Fgiving serious consideration to taking
OL,16,Faway her Citizenship.
