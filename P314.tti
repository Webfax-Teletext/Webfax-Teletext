OL,3,CWinter fuel payments cut could drive

OL,6,FThe Government's argument for means
OL,7,Ftesting Winter Fuel payments was that
OL,8,Fit could not justify paying the
OL,9,Fbenefits to rich pensioners in such
OL,10,Ftricky economic times.
OL,12,FSo they restricted pay outs to only
OL,13,Fthose who claim pension credit.
OL,14,FHowever, the shift has shone a light
OL,15,Fon the fact that only 63% of those who
OL,16,Fqualify for pension credit claim it,
OL,17,Fmeaning plenty of poorer pensioners
OL,18,Fare in line to miss out.

OL,3,CWinter fuel payments cut could drive

OL,6,FStarmer argued that the numbers also

OL,8,Fdrive to get more people to sign up
OL,9,Ffor pension credit, and in doing so
OL,10,Falso qualify for Winter Fuel Payments
OL,11,Fonce more.
OL,13,FThe actual figure for the number of

OL,15,Fbetween #50,000 and #100,000 for each
OL,16,Fyear up to 2029/30 - because the
OL,17,Fnumbers are rounded up to the closest
