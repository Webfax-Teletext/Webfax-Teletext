OL,11,FWhat is the Taurid meteor shower?
OL,13,FMost meteor showers are formed from
OL,14,Fthe debris of comets. The Taurids are
OL,15,Fmade up of rubble from a comet called
OL,16,FEncke.

OL,6,FWhen the rocks enter Earth's
OL,7,Fatmosphere, they become heated up by
OL,8,Fair resistance which makes them glow
OL,9,Fand gives them a fiery tail,
OL,10,Frecognisable as the end of a shooting
OL,11,Fstar.
OL,13,FThey vary in size from dust particle
OL,14,Fto that of a boulder, and are often
OL,15,Fvery bright fireballs.
OL,17,FThe space debris from Encke makes up
OL,18,Ftwo separate Taurid meteor showers -
OL,19,Fthe Southern Taurids, and the Northern
OL,20,FTaurids.

OL,6,FThe Southern Taurids reached their

OL,9,Fwill peak on November 12. Both showers
OL,10,Fwill go on to be visible until

OL,13,FHow can I see the meteors?
OL,15,FThe Taurids will be visible to the
OL,16,Fnaked eye, with no need for any

OL,18,FNASA, midnight is the best time to

OL,11,FMeteor showers are the most visible on

OL,10,Ffor the meteor shower.
