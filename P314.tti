OL,11,Fjoin the city's Pride event, despite

OL,15,FOrganisers say it is the largest

OL,17,Fwhich celebrates its 30th anniversary
OL,18,Fthis year, as people turned out in

OL,7,Fminister Viktor Orban's government
OL,8,Fpassed a new law which effectively

OL,12,FIt is the only country in the European

OL,15,FBut the move became a lightning rod
