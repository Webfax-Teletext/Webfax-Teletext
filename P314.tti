OL,6,FHezbollah is an Islamic militant and
OL,7,Fpolitical force based in Lebanon that
OL,8,Fhas been designated a terrorist group
OL,9,Fby many Western countries.
OL,11,FIt was founded in 1982 after the
OL,12,FLebanon War, which saw Israel occupy
OL,13,Fmuch of the south of Lebanon.
OL,15,FThe group specifically set out to copy
OL,16,Fthe model of Ayatollah Khomeini's
OL,17,FIranian Revolution in 1979 and has
OL,18,Fbeen an anti-Israel, anti-western
