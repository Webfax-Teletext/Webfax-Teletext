OL,7,Fgovernment's announcement of a ban on
OL,8,F"colourful lanyards" in the civil
OL,9,Fservice, accusing of acting like a

OL,12,FThe Labour leader said Mr Sunak had
OL,13,Fbeen focusing too much on "the war

OL,15,Fissues like the "prison system in

OL,9,Fannounced a ban on rainbow-coloured

OL,12,Fthey're an expression of "political

OL,15,FSome members of the civil service
