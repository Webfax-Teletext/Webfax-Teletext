OL,7,FScientists have discovered a new
OL,8,Fspecies of dinosaur on the Isle of
OL,9,FWight.
OL,11,FThe new iguanodontian dinosaur had an
OL,12,F"eye-catching sail" along its back and
OL,13,Ftail, which might have been used to
OL,14,Fattract mates.
OL,16,FIt was identified by Dr Jeremy
OL,17,FLockwood, a PhD student at the
OL,18,FUniversity of Portsmouth and the
OL,19,FNatural History Museum.
