OL,6,FITV News' Health Correspondent Rebecca
OL,7,FBarry breaks down the challenges our
OL,8,Fnext Prime Minister will come up
OL,9,Fagainst after the General Election -
OL,10,Fand what solutions political parties
OL,11,Fhave put forward.
OL,13,FPublic satisfaction with the NHS has
OL,14,Ffallen to the lowest level ever
OL,15,Frecorded, so whichever party wins this
OL,16,Felection faces some huge challenges.
OL,18,FHealth is a devolved issue in the four
OL,19,Fnations of the UK. We're focusing on
OL,20,FEngland because Westminster has
OL,21,Fresponsibility for the NHS there.
