OL,12,FIn the late 17th century the Commons
OL,13,Fdecided that when it came to financial
OL,14,Fdemands from the King, it would need
OL,15,Fto resolve them as a whole house.
OL,17,FSo, the position of Chairman of Ways
OL,18,Fand Means was created, keeping the
OL,19,FSpeaker from chairing the budget who
OL,20,Fwas seen by some as the King's spy.
