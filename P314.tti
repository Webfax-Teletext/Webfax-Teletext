OL,7,FIt is fairly extraordinary that the
OL,8,Ffuneral of a religious leader, even
OL,9,Fthe leader of a religion as big as
OL,10,FRoman Catholicism, should bring so
OL,11,Fmany crowned heads, heads of state and
OL,12,Fof government, to mourn and pay their
OL,13,Frespects.
OL,15,FBut they will be in Rome on Saturday:
OL,16,FPresident Trump and Melania, Macron,
OL,17,FStarmer and Prince William, the
OL,18,Fleaders of most of South America and
OL,19,Fmany more besides.

OL,7,FYes, the Pope is technically the head
OL,8,Fof state of the world's smallest
OL,9,Fcountry, and yes, his flock is 1.4
OL,10,Fbillion strong, but even so, that is
OL,11,Fquite the turnout.
OL,13,FIt is almost as if a Pope is much more
OL,14,Fthan a religious leader, but a man who
OL,15,Falso wields considerable political
OL,16,Fpower.
OL,18,F"How many divisions does the Pope
OL,19,Fhave?" Stalin famously once asked, but
OL,20,Fhe knew as well as anyone how much
OL,21,Fpolitics emanated from the Vatican.

OL,16,Ftransported right through the centre
