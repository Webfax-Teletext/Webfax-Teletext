OL,7,FTV presenter Gregg Wallace has said he
OL,8,Fwill now "take some time out" after
OL,9,Freceiving backlash for claiming
OL,10,Fcomplaints about his alleged behaviour
OL,11,Fcame from "a handful of middle-class
OL,12,Fwomen of a certain age".
OL,14,FHis comments not only upset
OL,15,Fcelebrities and the public, but also
OL,16,Fgarnered a response from Downing
OL,17,FStreet, calling them "inappropriate
OL,18,Fand misogynistic". Culture Secretary
