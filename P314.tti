OL,6,FThe US ambassador to Israel has been
OL,7,Fcondemned by Arab and Muslim nations
OL,8,Fafter he said Israel has a right to a
OL,9,Flarge portion of the Middle East.
OL,11,FMike Huckabee made the comments in an
OL,12,Finterview with conservative
OL,13,Fcommentator Tucker Carlson that aired
OL,14,FFriday.
OL,16,FCarlson said that according to the
OL,17,FBible, the descendants of Abraham
OL,18,Fwould receive land that today would
OL,19,Finclude vast swathes of the Middle
OL,20,FEast, and asked Huckabee if Israel had
