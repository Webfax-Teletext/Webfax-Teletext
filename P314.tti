OL,6,FTaylor Swift has said the alleged
OL,7,Fterror plot which led to the
OL,8,Fcancellation of three Eras Tour shows
OL,9,Fin Vienna in early August filled her
OL,10,Fwith a "new sense of fear".
OL,12,FThe US popstar was scheduled to play
OL,13,Fat the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel
OL,14,FStadium but the sold-out shows were
OL,15,Fcancelled after police arrested two
OL,16,Fmen over an alleged plot to launch an
OL,17,Fattack.
OL,19,F"Having our Vienna shows cancelled was
OL,20,Fdevastating," 34-year-old Swift said

OL,6,F"The reason for the cancellations
OL,7,Ffilled me with a new sense of fear,
OL,8,Fand a tremendous amount of guilt
OL,9,Fbecause so many people had planned on
OL,10,Fcoming to those shows.
OL,12,F"But I was also so grateful to the

OL,16,FSwift said she was "heartened by the

OL,18,F"banded together" after the news broke.
