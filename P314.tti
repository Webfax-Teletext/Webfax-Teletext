OL,6,FScientist James Watson, who shared a
OL,7,FNobel prize for helping discover the
OL,8,Fdouble-helix shape of the DNA
OL,9,Fmolecule, has died aged 97.
OL,11,FHis death was confirmed by a
OL,12,Fspokesperson with Cold Spring Harbor
OL,13,FLaboratory, where he spent the bulk of
OL,14,Fhis career, who said that he died
OL,15,Ffollowing a brief illness.
OL,17,FWatson, whose mission it was to figure

OL,19,Flike, won a Nobel Prize for it in 1962.
