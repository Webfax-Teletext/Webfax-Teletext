OL,6,FWhen I saw tonight's FT headline that
OL,7,Fthe chancellor is considering the
OL,8,Fabolition of thein next week's budget
OL,9,FI thought it must be an early April
OL,10,Ffool.
OL,12,FBut it is true.
OL,14,FSo concerned is Jeremy Hunt that he
OL,15,Fwon't have enough in the kitty for a
OL,16,Fsizeable cut in personal income taxes
OL,17,F- a giveaway more-or-less promised by
OL,18,Fthe PM - that he is considering even
OL,19,Fthat capitulation.

OL,7,Fmore than #3 billion for its
OL,8,Fpriorities, including reducing NHS
OL,9,Fwaiting lists, but has downgraded the
OL,10,Flikely tally to nearer #2 billion.
OL,12,FThat downgrade reflects the cost of

OL,14,Freduce the risk that .JTory

OL,6,FOne counter-intuitive problem for
OL,7,FJeremy Hunt is that inflation is lower
OL,8,Fthan the official forecaster the OBR
OL,9,Fthought it would be in the autumn,
OL,10,Fsuch that "fiscal drag" - the refusal
OL,11,Fto up-rate tax thresholds in line with
OL,12,Finflation - raises less money than
OL,13,Fexpected.
OL,15,FOn the contrary, the yield on 10-year
OL,16,Fgilts - another name for the interest
OL,17,Frate paid by the government when
OL,18,Fborrowing - has risen sharply in the
OL,19,Flast month.

OL,7,Fgovernment's interest payments will be
OL,8,Fhigher than it expected.JThe net
OL,9,Feffect is that there is less
