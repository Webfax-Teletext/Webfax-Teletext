OL,10,Fclimate crisis-linked landslide,
OL,11,Fscientists believe.
OL,13,FGiant waves caused by the landslide
OL,14,Fsloshed back and forth across a fjord,

OL,7,FThe initial event was found to be the
OL,8,Fcollapse of a 1.2km-high mountain peak
OL,9,Finto the remote Dickson Fjord beneath.
OL,11,FNot seen by the human eye, this
OL,12,Fcollapse caused a backsplash of water
OL,13,F200 metres in the air, with a wave up
OL,14,Fto 110 metres high.
OL,16,FThe researchers calculated that this
OL,17,Fwave, which extended across 10km of
OL,18,Ffjord, reduced to seven metres within
OL,19,Fa few minutes, and a few centimetres
OL,20,Fin the days after.
