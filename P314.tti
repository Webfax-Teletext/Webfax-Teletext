OL,15,FWhat is a Supermoon?
OL,17,FThe Moon's orbit around Earth isn't a
OL,18,Fperfect circle; at times, it's closer
OL,19,Fto Earth and appears slightly larger
OL,20,Fand brighter, while at other times, it
OL,21,Fis farther away and appears smaller.

OL,3,CWhat is the Wolf Supermoon and how can

OL,6,FA Supermoon occurs when a full moon
OL,7,Faligns with the Moon's closest point
OL,8,Fto Earth, known as perigee.
OL,10,FAt its farthest point, called apogee,
OL,11,Fthe Moon looks smaller and dimmer. The
OL,12,FMoon reaches both points during its 27-
OL,13,Fday orbit, but their exact distances
OL,14,Fchange slightly over time.
OL,16,F"Supermoon" isn't an official
OL,17,Fscientific term. But it usually means
OL,18,Fa full Moon that is very close to
OL,19,Fperigee. Supermoons happen about three
OL,20,Fto four times a year and often occur
OL,21,Fin a row.

OL,6,FAt its closest, a supermoon can look

OL,9,Fthough this difference can be hard to

OL,12,FSupermoons can also cause higher-than-
