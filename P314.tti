OL,7,Fquestion for the prime minister in the
OL,8,FMandelson affair.
OL,10,FWhy in December did he appoint Lord
OL,11,FMandelson to be US ambassador even
OL,12,Fthough Mandelson admitted during the
OL,13,Fvetting process that he continued to
OL,14,Fbe a friend and supporter "for some

OL,16,Fbillionaire was prosecuted and jailed

OL,6,FDowning Street has said that the
OL,7,Femails from Mandelson to Epstein -
OL,8,Fleaked to Bloomberg and that included
OL,9,FMandelson telling the late convicted
OL,10,Fpaedophile to "fight for early
OL,11,Frelease," adding, "I think the world
OL,12,Fof you" and "your friends stay with
OL,13,Fyou and love you" - represented
OL,14,Fmaterially new information.
OL,16,FIt was their publication on Wednesday
OL,17,Fevening that pushed the PM to sack
OL,18,FMandelson on Thursday morning.

OL,6,FOr at least Mandelson believed when

OL,8,FBloomberg's letter by Sir Oliver
OL,9,FRobbins, permanent under secretary at
OL,10,Fthe FCDO, that he was repeating
OL,11,Finformation already known to the

OL,14,FSo, in the simplest terms, why did
OL,15,FStarmer appoint Mandelson, given that
OL,16,FMandelson told government officials
OL,17,Fabout his continued friendship with
