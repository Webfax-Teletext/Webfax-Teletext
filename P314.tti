OL,10,Fmovement of the summer, the dictionary
OL,11,Fsaid.
OL,13,FThe movement became about embodying
OL,14,Fself-love, positive body image and
OL,15,Fsultry style choices, marking a sharp
OL,16,Fdeparture from the preceding "clean
OL,17,Fgirl" trend, which promoted things
OL,18,Fsuch as yoga, early nights and slicked
OL,19,Fback hair.
