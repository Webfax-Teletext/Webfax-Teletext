OL,9,FOn the first day of 2025, the
OL,10,Fsuspected terrorist attack in New
OL,11,FOrleans echoed some of the most
OL,12,Fharrowing attacks of the previous
OL,13,Fdecade.
OL,15,FA pickup truck was driven into crowds
OL,16,Fof New Year revelers, killing at least
OL,17,Ffifteen people, and injuring many
OL,18,Fmore. The city, alive with
OL,19,Ffestivities, was abruptly plunged into
OL,20,Fchaos.

OL,11,FVehicle-ramming attacks have become a

OL,14,Frefined by the so-called Islamic State
OL,15,F(ISIS) during the height of its self-

OL,17,Fproven brutally effective.

OL,6,FISIS propaganda frequently encouraged
OL,7,Ffollowers to use large vehicles to
OL,8,Ftarget crowds and then continue the
OL,9,Fassault with knives or firearms,
OL,10,Fmaximising casualties before being
OL,11,Fkilled and achieving so-called
OL,12,F"martyrdom". This was the pattern
OL,13,Ffollowed by the New Orleans attacker.
OL,14,FNo training or resources were required.
OL,16,FThis approach to terrorism has left an
OL,17,Findelible mark on recent history. In
OL,18,F2016, an ISIS-inspired lorry driver
OL,19,Fkilled 86 people in Nice, France,
OL,20,Fduring Bastille Day celebrations.

OL,6,FNearly six years after the territorial
OL,7,Fdefeat of ISIS, this atrocity raises
OL,8,Fpressing questions: has the threat
OL,9,Ffrom the group truly returned to the

OL,12,FThe truth is that it never truly

OL,15,Fcentral infrastructure to offer
OL,16,Fplanning support.
