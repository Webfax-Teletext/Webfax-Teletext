OL,7,FA power outage that plunged millions
OL,8,Fof people into darkness in Spain and
OL,9,FPortugal earlier this year was caused
OL,10,Fby technical and planning errors that
OL,11,Fleft the grid unable to handle a surge
OL,12,Fin voltage, the Spanish government has
OL,13,Fsaid.
OL,15,FEnvironment Minister Sara Aagesen, who
OL,16,Fmanages the nation's energy policy,
OL,17,Ftold reporters that a voltage surge
OL,18,Fled to small grid failures, mainly in
OL,19,Fthe south of Spain, which then
OL,20,Fcascaded to larger ones and brought
OL,21,Fthe system down in both countries.
