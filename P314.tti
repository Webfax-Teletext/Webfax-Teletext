OL,6,FIt's being described as "a watershed
OL,7,Fmoment" in the management of the
OL,8,Fhealth service in England, but what
OL,9,Fwill it mean for patients?
OL,11,FThe world's biggest quango, NHS
OL,12,FEngland, was set-up in 2012, under the
OL,13,Fcoalition government, to create an
OL,14,Farms-length body, operationally
OL,15,Findependent from politicians.
OL,17,FBut Lord Darzi's recent investigation
OL,18,Finto the NHS criticised that
OL,19,F"disastrous" top-down re-organisation.
OL,20,FHe said it was "a calamity without
OL,21,Finternational precedent".
