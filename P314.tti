OL,6,FWhile there's plenty of blame to go

OL,6,FIn June last year, the then chief IDF
OL,7,Fspokesman said Hamas could not be
OL,8,F'eliminated' militarily, but that is
OL,9,Fexactly what the IDF says it now

OL,12,FToday, the IDF has a new chief of
OL,13,Fstaff as well as a new chief spokesman.
OL,15,FAnd they believe they have as an ally
OL,16,Fa new US President, who will impose
OL,17,Ffewer restrictions on military
OL,18,Foperations than his predecessor did.

OL,6,FAt the end of its term, the Biden
OL,7,Fadministration revealed that Hamas was
OL,8,Frecruiting at almost as fast a rate as
OL,9,FIsrael was taking fighters off the
OL,10,Fbattlefield.
OL,12,FAnd while Hamas' infrastructure and
OL,13,Fsupply of weaponry have been badly
OL,14,Fhit, the terrorist group is said to be
OL,15,F25,000 strong, close to pre-war levels.
OL,17,FCritics accuse the Israeli Prime
OL,18,FMinister of resuming the war primarily
OL,19,Fto ensure the survival of his
OL,20,Fgovernment.

OL,6,FHardliners in Mr Netanyahu's cabinet
OL,7,Fwere threatening to walk away if there
OL,8,Fwas no return to hostilities.
OL,10,FThe most vocal Israelis to come out
OL,11,Fagainst what's happened are the
OL,12,Ffamilies of the remaining hostages in
OL,13,FGaza.
OL,15,FThere are thought to be 24 captives

OL,18,FTheir predicament looks worse than
OL,19,Fever. And to a great extent that
OL,20,Fpredicament is shared by ordinary
OL,21,FGazans.
