OL,6,FWe have seen many remarkable images of
OL,7,FDonald Trump over the years.
OL,9,FBut never one as bizarre and
OL,10,Fincongruent as this: the former
OL,11,FPresident on Fifth Avenue on Thursday
OL,12,Fnight pumping the air with his fists
OL,13,Fand waving to New Yorkers.
OL,15,FIt was as if he has secured a major

OL,6,FIn fact, by a jury of his peers. The
OL,7,Fbrutal fact for the history books is
OL,8,Finescapably damning: He has become the
OL,9,Ffirst ex-American president to be
OL,10,Fconvicted of a crime.
OL,12,FHe emerged from the courtroom

OL,6,FCertainly, millions of his core
OL,7,Fsupporters will buy this argument.
OL,8,FTrump is already fundraising using the

OL,10,Foutrage towards Democrats and dollars
OL,11,Ffor his campaign, proudly calling
