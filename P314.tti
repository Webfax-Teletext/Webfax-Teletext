OL,6,F"It certainly isn't my place to be

OL,8,Fpoint to any non-allied warship, as a
OL,9,Ffrigate captain in the Royal Navy, is
OL,10,Fthat if you're transiting through our
OL,11,Fwaters, and there was any possibility
OL,12,Fyou could pose a threat to us, you
OL,13,Fshould expect the Royal Navy to be
OL,14,Fvery close at hand," he said.
