OL,6,FChronic lung disease patients who live
OL,7,Fin deprived areas or further away from
OL,8,Fclinics are more likely to die
OL,9,Fcompared with wealthier people who
OL,10,Flive closer, a study has suggested.
OL,12,FExperts warned the findings highlight
OL,13,F"an alarming disparity" that "demands
OL,14,Furgent attention".
OL,16,FThe study, led by the University of
OL,17,FEast Anglia (UEA), analysed data from
OL,18,F2,359 patients with idiopathic
OL,19,Fpulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which causes
OL,20,Fthe lungs to become scarred and makes
OL,21,Fbreathing increasingly difficult.
