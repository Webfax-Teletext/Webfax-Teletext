OL,6,FTo note, not all ticks carry the
OL,7,Finfection, and even if you're bitten
OL,8,Fby one that does, it doesn't guarantee
OL,9,Fyou'll develop Lyme disease.
OL,11,FAlso, the tick usually needs to be
OL,12,Fattached for several hours to transmit
OL,13,Fthe bacteria.
OL,15,FTicks are small insects that can
OL,16,Fnormally be found in woodlands

OL,6,FSymptoms are normally mild but can be

OL,8,Fto treat if it is diagnosed early.
OL,10,FWhat are the symptoms?
OL,12,FMany who experience early symptoms of
OL,13,Fthe disease will develop a circular
OL,14,Fred skin rash around a tick bite.
OL,16,FThe rash can appear up to three months
OL,17,Fafter being bitten and can last for
OL,18,Fseveral months, according to the NHS
OL,20,FHowever, most rashes can emerge within
OL,21,Fthe first four weeks after a tick bite.
