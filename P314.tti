OL,17,FThe term 'thundery breakdown' is a

OL,20,Fthunderstorms following a spell of
OL,21,Fhot, dry, settled weather.

OL,6,FInstead, a 'shower' refers to a
OL,7,Fhaphazardly forming spell of rain - be
OL,8,Fit light or heavy, short or prolonged
OL,9,F- that forms away from an organised
OL,10,Fband of rain along a frontal system
OL,11,Feg. a cold, warm or occluded front
OL,12,F(blue, red or purple respectively on a
OL,13,Fweather map).
OL,15,FShowers, instead, are very localised
OL,16,Fand form randomly in unstable air,
OL,17,Fwhich is why it can be tipping it down
OL,18,Fwith rain in one area, and bone dry
OL,19,Fjust a mile away!

OL,6,FThey are generated by localised
OL,7,Fheating of the Earth's surface, which
OL,8,Fcauses warm air to rise, cool, and
OL,9,Fcondense into clouds. Unlike 'frontal
OL,10,Frain', showers often start and stop
OL,11,Fvery suddenly.
OL,13,FWhen we get intense heating of the
OL,14,FEarth, during a prolonged hot spell,
OL,15,Fthis warming air rises higher and
OL,16,Ffaster than normal and creates huge,
OL,17,Ftowering thunderclouds like giant
OL,18,Fskyscrapers in the air.

OL,6,FWe see this discharge as 'lightning'
OL,7,Fand the sound that it makes is
OL,8,Fthunder, which is caused by the
OL,9,Frapidly expanding air as the lightning
