OL,9,Fthe consequences, as Geraint Vincent
OL,10,Freports
OL,12,FPlastic surgery is a serious business.
OL,13,FIt invariably involves incisions. Very
OL,14,Foften the plastic surgeon is putting
OL,15,Fsomething in, or taking something out,
OL,16,Fof the patient's body.
OL,18,FThe risk of a wound not healing, and
OL,19,Fof subsequent infection, is very real.
OL,20,FSo aftercare is enormously important.

OL,6,FThe main attraction of travelling to

OL,8,Fprice. You can have your tummy tuck in

OL,13,FNot worrying too much about aftercare

OL,10,FChristian Richards travelled to Turkey
OL,11,Ffor a range of treatments -
OL,12,Fliposuction, tummy tuck and the
OL,13,Fremoval of fat from his chest.
OL,15,FHe felt something was wrong
OL,16,Fimmediately after the surgery, but
OL,17,Fwhen he got back to the UK he told ITV
OL,18,FNews that he developed a hard lump in

OL,20,Fshape of an American football.

OL,6,FChristian went back to the clinic
OL,7,Fwhere he'd had the work done. They
OL,8,Ftold him his symptoms were normal, and
OL,9,Fthen they ghosted him - even blocking
OL,10,Fhis attempts to communicate with them
OL,11,Fon social media.
OL,13,F"They sold me a dream," he said.
OL,15,F"But there was no support, it was

OL,18,FChristian ended up having corrective

OL,20,FTurkey. He reckons the whole process
OL,21,Fcost him somewhere around #20,000.

OL,6,FCourtney Rowley was advised to have
OL,7,Fgastric band surgery by doctors in the
OL,8,FUK because a hormone imbalance led to
OL,9,Fher putting on a lot of weight.
OL,11,FShe went to Turkey for the procedure
OL,12,Fbecause the waiting times were so long
OL,13,Fhere. When she came home she felt
OL,14,Fworse with every day that went by,
OL,15,Funtil eventually, she couldn't stand

OL,18,FA lack of nutrition meant that she'd
