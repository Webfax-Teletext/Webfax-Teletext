OL,7,FUkrainian President Volodymyr
OL,8,FZelenskyy has urged the West that a
OL,9,F"response is needed" to Russia's
OL,10,Fthreat to use a new unstoppable
OL,11,Fballistic missile against the UK and
OL,12,Fother nations.
OL,14,FZelenskyy said the use of a ballistic
OL,15,Fmissile to hit the eastern Ukrainian
OL,16,Fcity of Dnipro was a "clear and severe
OL,17,Fescalation in the scale and brutality
OL,18,Fof this war," adding that Russian
OL,19,FPresident Putin would attack or
OL,20,Fdestabilise other countries unless
OL,21,Fhe's stopped.
