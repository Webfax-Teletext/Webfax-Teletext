OL,6,F"It's a lot more fun to do the Titanic
OL,7,Fthan it is to sit at home and count my
OL,8,Fmoney," he said.
OL,10,FWhen he first floated his dream of
OL,11,Fbuilding the to-scale model of the
OL,12,FTitanic more than a decade ago, the
OL,13,Fpopular view was that he was rich and
OL,14,Feccentric enough to do it.
OL,16,FBut he was forced to put the
OL,17,Fmultimillion-dollar project on hold
OL,18,Fwhen the pandemic hit and ports closed.
