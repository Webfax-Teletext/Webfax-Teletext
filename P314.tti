OL,7,FA New York judge has said the
OL,8,Ftranscripts from the secret grand jury
OL,9,Ftestimony that led to the sex
OL,10,Ftrafficking indictment of Ghislaine
OL,11,FMaxwell won't be released.
OL,13,FLast month, federal prosecutors asked
OL,14,Fto unseal the documents as suspicion
OL,15,Fgrew over what the government knew
OL,16,Fabout Jeffrey Epstein.
OL,18,FEpstein died whilst awaiting trial for
OL,19,Fsex trafficking charges. Maxwell was
OL,20,Flater convicted of helping Epstein
OL,21,Fprey on underage girls.

OL,7,FIt is unclear what the documentation

OL,9,FDepartment acknowledged that the
OL,10,Ftranscripts contained no testimony
OL,11,Ffrom witnesses who weren't members of
OL,12,Flaw enforcement.
OL,14,FIn a written ruling made on Monday,
OL,15,FJudge Paul A. Engelmayer argued that
OL,16,Fthe government had suggested the
OL,17,Fmaterials could be released to the
OL,18,Fpublic "causally or promiscuously",
OL,19,Fwhich would risk "unraveling the

OL,21,Fgrand jury is premised."
