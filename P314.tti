OL,8,Fthere will not be any new

OL,11,FThe shadow Chancellor has had one
OL,12,Fcentral aim ever since she took the
OL,13,Fjob in May 2022 - building trust in
OL,14,Fthe Labour party, and in her.
OL,16,FThe first plank of Reeves' plan was to
OL,17,Fturn her into a credible candidate to
OL,18,Fbe chancellor and so she repeatedly
OL,19,Fstressed her credentials, including
OL,20,Fher time as a Bank of England
OL,21,Feconomist.
