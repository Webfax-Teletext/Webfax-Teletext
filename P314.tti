OL,6,FThe new Labour government is to make
OL,7,Fmembers of House of Lords retire at
OL,8,Fthe age of 80 in a bid to reduce the
OL,9,Fnumber of people in the unelected
OL,10,Fchamber.
OL,12,FPrime Minister Keir Starmer committed
OL,13,Fto the age cap in Labour's manifesto,
OL,14,Fto try and phase out people who have
OL,15,Finherited their positions.
OL,17,FThe Labour leader has previously
OL,18,Fpromised he would abolish the House of
OL,19,FLords entirely, replacing it with a
OL,20,Fchamber of elected members.

OL,6,FSpeaking in 2022, Starmer described
OL,7,Fthe House of Lords as '"indefensible",
OL,8,Fand promised "the biggest ever
OL,9,Ftransfer of power from Westminster to
OL,10,Fthe British people".
OL,12,FBut this pledge has been watered down
OL,13,Ffor now, with Labour promising to

OL,15,F"the right of hereditary peers to sit
OL,16,Fand vote in the House of Lords."
