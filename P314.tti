OL,8,FThe Single Justice Procedure (SJP) is
OL,9,Fa legal process used by magistrates'
OL,10,Fcourts to deal with low-level
OL,11,Foffences, for example driving a car
OL,12,Fwithout insurance or using a TV
OL,13,Fwithout a licence.
OL,15,FA key difference is that when a
OL,16,Fdefendant pleads guilty, they do not
OL,17,Fneed to attend court, and therefore
OL,18,Fmost cases are heard in private.
