OL,6,FThe ONS said an increase in household

OL,8,Fto the latest rise in inflation.
OL,10,FThe annual rate of inflation rose
OL,11,Fsharply to 2.3% last month. But what
OL,12,Fshould we make of that?
OL,14,FFirstly, it's not 11.1%.
OL,16,FTwo years ago, consumer price
OL,17,Finflation was running at double

OL,7,Fin October was always on the cards

OL,10,Fthe unit price of gas and electricity.
OL,11,FBut that was chunkier than forecast.
OL,13,FAirfares, the price of clothing and
OL,14,Fhotels all jumped last month.

OL,18,Fthe UK (which excludes volatile food

OL,9,FThirdly, the Budget means there's more

OL,12,FThe chancellor hiked the rate of
