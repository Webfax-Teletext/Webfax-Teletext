OL,11,FSomething rare and extraordinary

OL,15,FThe "surplus" in January of #16.7

OL,8,Fmoney as millions of people scramble
OL,9,Fto complete self-assessment tax

OL,12,FThe Big Picture is the government

OL,15,FThe latest figures from the Office for
OL,16,FNational Statistics (ONS), show the

OL,18,Fthe first ten months of this financial

OL,6,FJeremy Hunt has said many times that
OL,7,Fhe wants to cut taxes, which have
OL,8,Frisen at a record pace in the last
OL,9,Ffive years, on March 6.
OL,11,FHe has also expressed a desire to

OL,13,Frecruitment problems and the world
OL,14,Ffeels a more dangerous place) and on
OL,15,Fthe NHS (where key service targets are

OL,9,FNational Income in five years time -
OL,10,Fwhich, in theory, he needs to stick to.
OL,12,FJeremy Hunt's problem, according to
OL,13,FTreasury sources, is that on Tuesday
OL,14,Fevening the OBR handed him the latest
OL,15,Fiteration of its economic forecast for
OL,16,Fthe UK which made clear he cannot

OL,6,FThe OBR's assessment is that gilt
OL,7,Fyields have risen in the last six
OL,8,Fweeks and with them the cost of
OL,9,Fservicing the government's debt.
OL,11,FThe path of inflation in the next few

OL,14,Fthis is clearly good news in one sense

OL,16,Fgovernment's decision to freeze the

OL,18,FNational Insurance until 2027/28 will
OL,19,F(stealthily) raise less money.
