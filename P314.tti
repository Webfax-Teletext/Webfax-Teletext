OL,7,FBut what about "fried", "toastered",
OL,8,For "sozzled"? Well, they're valid too,
OL,9,Faccording to this study.
OL,11,FThe professors discovered that "drunk"
OL,12,Fmainly occurs in the combinations
OL,13,F"too", "so", or "very" drunk but
OL,14,Funexpectedly, not with the kinds of
OL,15,Fadverb used by McIntyre.
OL,17,FBy contrast, the drunkonyms ending in
OL,18,Fed (for example, "blasted" and
OL,19,F"loaded") most often occur with the
OL,20,Fexpected intensifiers "completely" or
OL,21,F"totally" (like, "completely loaded").

OL,9,FEnglish native speakers reach

OL,12,Fending in -ed meaning "drunk" that it

OL,8,F"gazeboed" or "carparked" funny is
OL,9,Fthat there is no obvious relation
OL,10,Fbetween the base (e.g. "gazebo") and

OL,13,FThe English language also expresses
