OL,9,FA school in southwest Wales went into
OL,10,Flockdown this week following a violent
OL,11,Fincident.
OL,13,FA "code red" alarm sounded through the
OL,14,Fschool's PA system, prompting students
OL,15,Fand staff to hide in classrooms, and
OL,16,Ffour hours later they were .
OL,18,FThe incident has raised the topic of
OL,19,Fhow in an emergency scenario, and
OL,20,Fwhether schools are adequately
OL,21,Fprepared for these events.

OL,9,FWhat is a "code red"?
OL,11,FThe phrase "code red" was used
OL,12,Frepeatedly in reference to the
OL,13,Fincident at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, also
OL,14,Fknown locally as Amman Valley School.
OL,16,FWhen staff decided that it was a "code

OL,18,Fover the PA system and most people
OL,19,Ftook cover in classrooms.
