OL,3,CChancellor to squeeze spending
OL,4,Cfollowing growth collapse
OL,6,FThe story of next week's spring
OL,7,Fstatement will be simple: there will
OL,8,Fbe lower economic growth in 2025, and
OL,9,Fprobably in 2026 too; and as a
OL,10,Fconsequence, there will be less money
OL,11,Favailable for public services for the
OL,12,Fspending review period 2026-2030.
OL,14,FHere are the bald numbers. The Office
OL,15,Ffor Budget Responsibility back in
OL,16,FOctober was forecasting growth this
OL,17,Fyear of 2%.

OL,6,FEven at the time this looked
OL,7,Foptimistic, or toppy, especially given
OL,8,Fthe shock to business's costs and
OL,9,Fconfidence caused by Rachel Reeves's
OL,10,Fbig rise in employers' national
OL,11,Finsurance.
OL,13,FSince then there has been a bigger
OL,14,Fglobal shock: Trump, and his tariffs.
OL,15,FThe consequence is that every

OL,17,Fto the US Federal Reserve, is
OL,18,Fdowngrading growth forecasts.

OL,6,FSo on Wednesday the OBR's 2% will
OL,7,Fbecome circa 1%. I assume the
OL,8,Ffollowing year's 1.8% will also be
OL,9,Frevised down.
OL,11,FAnd lower growth means lower tax
OL,12,Frevenues.
OL,14,FThere's a double whammy that the

OL,6,FSo everything else being equal, the
OL,7,Fchancellor is set to miss both of her
OL,8,Ffiscal targets, the primary one that
OL,9,Fsays there should be no borrowing to
OL,10,Ffinance day-to-day expenditure and the
OL,11,Fother one that says debt must be
OL,12,Ffalling as a share of GDP or national
OL,13,Fincome.
OL,15,FHer fiscal headroom has evaporated,
OL,16,Fwhich is not something she says she
OL,17,Fwill tolerate. For better or worse,
OL,18,Fher self-defining precept is that her
OL,19,Ffiscal rules must never be breached or
OL,20,Fsoftened.

OL,6,FSo what to do?
OL,8,FShe will not put up taxes. The widely

OL,10,Fthe freeze on income tax allowances
OL,11,Ftill 2030 as a stealth tax will not be
OL,12,Fdeployed.
OL,14,FHave you heard our podcast Talking

OL,16,Finto the biggest issues dominating the

OL,6,FWhat will give?
OL,8,FWe already know, as of yesterday, that
OL,9,Fspending on disability benefits will
OL,10,Fbe cut by #5 billion. But she needs
OL,11,Fmore than that to balance the books.
OL,13,FSo the forecast annual rise in public
OL,14,Fservice spending from 2026-2030 of
OL,15,F1.3% will be reduced to nearer 1%.
OL,17,FTo be clear, this is still not
OL,18,Fausterity. These are real rises.
OL,20,FBut for many government services it
OL,21,Fwill feel like austerity.
