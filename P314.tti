OL,7,FShe added that if Biden had stepped

OL,9,Fan open primary - which would have let
OL,10,Fmultiple Democrat candidates compete
OL,11,Ffor the chance to succeed Biden.
OL,13,F"The anticipation was that, if the
OL,14,Fpresident were to step aside, that
OL,15,Fthere would be an open primary," she
OL,16,Fsaid.
OL,18,FPelosi speculated that Kamala Harris
OL,19,Fmight have had a "stronger chance" of
OL,20,Fbeating Donald Trump if there had been
OL,21,Fsuch a selection process.
