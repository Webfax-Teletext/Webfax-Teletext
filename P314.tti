OL,6,FSenft says that laser directed-energy
OL,7,Fweapons are particularly effective
OL,8,Fagainst slow, low-flying drones. These
OL,9,Fare deployed by Russia and consist of

OL,13,FWhat are the weapon's limitations?
OL,15,FWeapons like Tryzub have two key
OL,16,Flimitations, according to Senft,
OL,17,Frelated to how fast their target is
