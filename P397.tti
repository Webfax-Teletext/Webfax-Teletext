OL,9,Fwith the outside world.
OL,11,FBut they are now hoping an operation,
OL,12,Fwhich they are trying to raise
OL,13,Fthousands for, will help change that.
OL,15,FShe said: "Jack's at an age where I
OL,16,Ffeel he wants to be a bit more
OL,17,Findependent and he needs that
OL,18,Findependence but he can't go into a
