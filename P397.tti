OL,6,FThe chief of the nursing watchdog has
OL,7,Fsaid "we should've acted faster" to
OL,8,Fsuspend child serial killer Lucy Letby.
OL,10,FPaul Rees, who was appointed head of
OL,11,Fthe Nursing and Midwifery Council
OL,12,F(NMC) in July, told The Independent
OL,13,Fthat the regulator should have
OL,14,Fsuspended the child killer when she
OL,15,Fwas first arrested.
OL,17,FInstead, Letby was free to work as a
OL,18,Fnurse with no restrictions from the
OL,19,Fwatchdog until she was charged more
OL,20,Fthan two years later.
