OL,8,Fwitness a riot in Southport just hours
OL,9,Fafter a peaceful vigil for three
OL,10,Fmurdered children.
OL,12,FThere were hints all day of the
OL,13,Ftrouble that was to come in Southport.
OL,15,FAmong families, crying quietly and
OL,16,Flaying flowers, there were young men
OL,17,Fwith go-proJcameras attached to their
OL,18,FT-shirts ordering me and my colleagues
OL,19,Fto 'tell the truth'.

OL,6,FSome heckled the Prime Minister as he
OL,7,Flaid his tribute to those killed and
OL,8,Finjured: "How many more children have

OL,11,FThen around 7:15pm fleets of vans

OL,13,Faround those flowersJstill being laid,
OL,14,Fsometimes by children the same age as

OL,11,FAs soon as that call ended, a police
