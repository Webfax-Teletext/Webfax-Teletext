OL,7,FThe ILM Group has submitted proposals
OL,8,Ffor 230 lodges to be built next to the
OL,9,Fbeach, which is estimated to increase
OL,10,Fthe amount of visitors to the area
OL,11,Ffrom 80,000 to 270,000 a year.
OL,13,FOne local, Kelly Holland, worries the

OL,15,Fdelicate habitat.
OL,17,FShe said: "Thousands of extra guests
OL,18,Fcoming down onto this beach would
OL,19,Ftrample the dunes and all the delicate
OL,20,Fhabitats for the toads, but also for
OL,21,Fother endangered species and plants."

OL,7,FLorraine Wall, from Friends of the

OL,9,Feveryone should be able to enjoy the
OL,10,Fbeach, such a sharp increase in

OL,12,Fdamage.
OL,14,FShe said: "Of course people want to
OL,15,Fenjoy this wonderful area, and we
OL,16,Fwouldn't want to stop that from
