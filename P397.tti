OL,6,FKaren said: "Over the past 3 weeks
OL,7,FI've been chasing the sightings, there
OL,8,Fwere definitely times when I thought
OL,9,Fit was going to be impossible to be in
OL,10,Fthe right place at the right time.
OL,11,FStill, we followed up every sighting
OL,12,Fand I think it helped our chances by
OL,13,Fnot giving up!"
OL,15,FAvril Muller, one of the page admins,
OL,16,Fsaid: "We never doubted that Eddie
OL,17,Fwould be found. The important
OL,18,Fbreakthrough was the photo which was
OL,19,Ftaken on the Mountain Road last week.
OL,20,FThat proved that Eddie was well and
OL,21,Falive."
