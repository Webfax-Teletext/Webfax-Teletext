OL,6,FA Salford roofer has been jailed after
OL,7,Fleaving an elderly widow with a badly
OL,8,Fdamaged roof almost #13,000 out of
OL,9,Fpocket.
OL,11,FPreston Crown Court heard that
OL,12,FChristopher Parr, 37, trading as Up
OL,13,Fand Over Roofing and Building, was
OL,14,Foriginally called out to look at a
OL,15,Fleaking skylight.
OL,17,FBut he quickly told his unsuspecting
OL,18,Fvictim that additional work was
OL,19,Fneeded, to which she agreed.

OL,12,FGiven that an area of tiles had

OL,16,FParr's bank account totalling #7,800.

OL,20,Fover three to four months as to why he
OL,21,Fcouldn't finish it off.
