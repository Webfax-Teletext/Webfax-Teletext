OL,3,CThe beloved animal reserve that could
OL,4,Cbe forced to close after 40 years
OL,6,FIt was founded by Ray Jackson - when
OL,7,Fhe began caring for two fox clubs way
OL,8,Fback in 1989.
OL,10,FRay said: "I came here on a community
OL,11,Fprogramme as I'd lost my job at Crewe
OL,12,FLocomotive Works. I took one walk
OL,13,Faround the nature reserve and I said
OL,14,FI'm not leaving here. That was right
OL,15,Fat the very beginning and I'm still
OL,16,Fhere now 38 years later."
OL,18,F"Over the years it's got busier and
OL,19,Fbusier and bigger and bigger. We now
OL,20,Ftake in two and a half to 3000 animals
OL,21,Fa year."

OL,6,FThe reserve also survives thanks to
OL,7,Fthe help of volunteers, like Ian
OL,8,FDaniels. He takes Chocolate the
OL,9,Fresident owl to schools and hospices
OL,10,Fas a therapy bird.
OL,12,F"All the kids from 18 down to 2 want
OL,13,Fto come an stroke her because she's so
OL,14,Fgentle. And secondly when you go into
OL,15,Fhospitals and hospices, it gives
OL,16,Fpeople that calming influence. She
OL,17,Flooks into your eyes, and she looks

OL,20,FBut now the sanctuary is in dire
OL,21,Ffinancial difficulty.
