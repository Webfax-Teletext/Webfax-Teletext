OL,8,Fof the group phoned 999.
OL,10,FGreg said: "You're looking at one of
OL,11,Fyour best mates and you're just hoping
OL,12,Fand praying that he'll get over it.
OL,14,F"But the longer that time goes on and

OL,9,Fthat goes by, your chances of recovery
OL,10,Fdrop by 10%."
OL,12,FRay said it felt like "someone turned
OL,13,Fa dimmer switch" and he did not
OL,14,Fremember much after.
OL,16,F"It was completely out of the blue. I
OL,17,Fjust started to feel fuzzy and my legs
OL,18,Ffelt heavy but there were not symptoms
OL,19,Fof a heart attack," he said.
