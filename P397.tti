OL,7,Fa new test to prevent critically ill
OL,8,Fnewborn babies going deaf.
OL,10,FThe genetic test can determine whether
OL,11,Fbabies are likely to go deaf, if
OL,12,Ftreated with a commonly used
OL,13,Fantibiotic called gentamicin.
OL,15,FResearchers from Saint Mary's Hospital
OL,16,Fand Manchester University have worked
OL,17,Falongside private firm Genedrive PLC
OL,18,Fto develop the test.
OL,20,FIt is going to be trialled in 14 NHS
OL,21,Fneonatal units across the country.
