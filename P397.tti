OL,6,FMr Norouznia says that they lose
OL,7,Fcustomers from "several tables" every
OL,8,Fday when they look at the menu and see
OL,9,Fno meat is listed.
OL,11,F"When someone who loves to eat meat
OL,12,Fcomes in and they find there is
OL,13,Fnothing for them to eat then they
OL,14,Fdon't want to eat anything, they do
OL,15,Fnot feel happy to sit, so they leave
OL,16,Fso we are losing customers a lot,
OL,17,Fevery day at least one to two tables a

OL,6,FHe admits though that it a difficult
OL,7,Fdecision to extend the menu to offer
OL,8,Fsome dairy products and meat options.
OL,10,F"Personally I am going to struggle the

OL,13,Fdifficult for me but I have to feed a

OL,6,F"I have to decide, either keep it like

OL,6,FMr Norouznia said they have already
OL,7,Fexpanded the menu to compete, adding
OL,8,Fpizzas and lunchtime deals but now
OL,9,Fthey have no choice but to offer a
OL,10,Fwider menu.
OL,12,FMost of the lunchtime customers
OL,13,Funderstood the move, one saying: "It
OL,14,Fmeans you can come in with a friend
OL,15,Fwho isn't vegan and there is more

OL,18,FWhile another said: "It seems a bit
