OL,6,FRobin Cropper, who farms 1,300 acres
OL,7,Fof land in Aughton, Ormskirk, says he
OL,8,Fwould ordinarily expect to produce
OL,9,Fbetween 4,000, and 5,000 tonnes of
OL,10,Fpotatoes a season.
OL,12,FBut this year, he says his yields will
OL,13,Fbe significantly reduced because of
OL,14,Flate planting and volatile weather.
OL,16,FHe said: "Once the crop is starting
OL,17,Fgrowing and ready to harvest, a lot of
OL,18,Fthem are a long way off and we have to
OL,19,Fuse crop protection products to stop
OL,20,Ffungi growing."
