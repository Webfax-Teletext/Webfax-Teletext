OL,7,Ffrom Merseyside Police said: "It's
OL,8,Ftruly shocking that a church, which is

OL,15,Fout repair work to the garages and
OL,16,Falso the smashed church window.
OL,18,F"To deliberately start a fire is
OL,19,Fincredibly dangerous and this incident
OL,20,Fcould have been a lot worse.
