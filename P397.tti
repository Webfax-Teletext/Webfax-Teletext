OL,6,FTrain operator Avanti West Coast has

OL,8,Fweekday London service for Blackpool
OL,9,Fafter controversial cuts to the
OL,10,Foperation.
OL,12,FIt brings some hope to commuters from
OL,13,Fthe town who rely on train services to
OL,14,Fthe capital, that the extra train
OL,15,Fservice could be added when the next
OL,16,Ftimetables changes are implemented in
OL,17,FMay although the bid has not yet been
OL,18,Fapproved.

OL,9,Fbeing cut to just two a day, starting

OL,12,FThe reductions, part of new timetable

OL,15,FThe department said it took the action
