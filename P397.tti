OL,10,FJames Loveridge, 28, rammed into other
OL,11,Fcars and drove the wrong way down the
OL,12,FM56 before eventually crashing into a
OL,13,Ffence in Wythenshawe, Manchester.
OL,15,FHis shocking driving terrorised other
OL,16,Fmotorists, with one, a veteran who had
OL,17,Fserved in Afghanistan, describing it

OL,11,FProsecutors told how Loveridge was

OL,13,Fwhen traffic was "heavy".
OL,15,FThe driver of an AA recovery truck
OL,16,Fbecame aware of Loveridge near
OL,17,Fjunction 12. Loveridge overtook the
OL,18,Ftruck and moved in front of it. He
OL,19,Fthen suddenly began to slam his

OL,21,Fdriver to collide with it.
