OL,6,FStephen said: "Honestly, I dug the
OL,7,Fhole and what came out was what I
OL,8,Fthought it was a silver coin.
OL,10,F"It was only when I got home, that I
OL,11,Fcleaned it up and realised it was a
OL,12,Fmedal. It was unbelievable really, to
OL,13,Factually find a medal on Armistice
OL,14,Fday."
OL,16,FAfter some research, Stephen and an
OL,17,Farchaeologist discovered the medal
OL,18,Fbelonged to Private Nicholas
OL,19,FFarnworth, a soldier who served with
OL,20,Fthe East Lancashire Regiment during
OL,21,Fthe First World War.

OL,6,FStephen continued: "I suspect what
OL,7,Fhappened is that he was attending a
OL,8,FRemembrance Sunday service.
OL,10,F"I think he was walking through the
OL,11,Ffield with his medal on and he's
OL,12,Feither tripped or fell because the
OL,13,Fmedal itself is not complete. It's
OL,14,Fonly the circular part of the medal
OL,15,Fand not the holder."
OL,17,FThere is still no picture of Nicholas,
OL,18,Fbut after weeks of searching, Stephen
OL,19,Fmanaged to track down his great niece
OL,20,FLisa and return the medal to her.

OL,6,FLisa Walmsley said: "It's an honour to
OL,7,Fbe contacted. People like Stephen are
OL,8,Fgiving us a lot back in terms of
OL,9,Fhistory and particularly when it's
OL,10,Fpeople that have fought for us in war,
OL,11,Fso I am thankful.
OL,13,F"Hopefully there maybe other family
OL,14,Fthat are more direct (to Nicholas)
OL,15,Fthat may come forward."
OL,17,FAlthough what Private Nicholas looks
OL,18,Flike remains a mystery, Stephen's
OL,19,Funcovered a piece of history, that has
OL,20,Fhelped bridge generations.
