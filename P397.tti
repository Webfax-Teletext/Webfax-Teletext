OL,6,FOne man who knows the iconic landmark
OL,7,Flike the back of his hand is Dave Hume
OL,8,Fwho worked there for three decades and
OL,9,Fhas done everything from changing
OL,10,Flightbulbs to painting the tower.
OL,12,FDave said: "I was chipping the
OL,13,Fpainting, knocking the loose paint
OL,14,Foff, knocking the rust off, and then
OL,15,Fpainting it to make sure that it was
OL,16,Fall good to go again."

OL,6,FDave said the colour of the paint used
OL,7,Ffor the tower was called "tower red"
OL,8,Fwhich he said is "not the best colour
OL,9,Fto light up unfortunately as it just
OL,10,Fabsorbs all the light".
OL,12,FHe added: "There are better colours,
OL,13,Fbut you can't change the colour
OL,14,Fwithout Government permission."
OL,16,FDave worked as a rigger for the tower
OL,17,Fwhich involves maintaining the
OL,18,Fattraction's structure, a job that
OL,19,Fneeded a head for heights and a strong
OL,20,Fstomach.

OL,6,F"We had nothing to hold onto, you just
OL,7,Fwalked across the steel-work to get to

OL,10,FThe tower includes other attractions
OL,11,Fsuch as the famous Tower Ballroom and
OL,12,Fthe ever popular Tower Circus which is
OL,13,Fthe oldest of its type in the world.
OL,15,FAs well as being responsible for the
