OL,6,FAn investigation by the Health and

OL,8,Fhad been hand picking waste after the
OL,9,Fconveyor belt they used had been
OL,10,Fremoved from use after it was
OL,11,Fsignificantly damaged in a fire a few
OL,12,Fmonths earlier.
OL,14,FEmployees were therefore required to
OL,15,Fwork directly on the ground, near
OL,16,Fmoving vehicles with no separation
OL,17,Fbetween them, putting the workers in
OL,18,Fconsiderable danger. There was no risk

OL,20,Ffor picking and sorting waste on the
OL,21,Fground.
