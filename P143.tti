OL,6,FSome thoughts from a member of The TV
OL,7,FRoom team on David's final evening on
OL,8,Fair:
OL,10,F"Throughout his time in continuity,
OL,11,FDavid has set the standard.
OL,13,F"When David first started, technical
OL,14,Ffacilities in continuity were
OL,15,Fprimitive and somewhat lacking
OL,16,Frelative to the other nations and
OL,17,FNetwork. The technical quality of
OL,18,Fjunctions left a lot to be desired,
OL,19,Fwith picture rolls when switching
OL,20,Fbetween Belfast and London.
