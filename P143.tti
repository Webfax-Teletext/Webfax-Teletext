OL,5,
OL,6,FIt was interesting to read a claim on a
OL,7,Fforum that it was a surprise that
OL,8,FBritish TV still had announcers.
OL,10,FIt is never a bad thing to question
OL,11,Fconventions. Sometimes things are
OL,12,Fsimply done through habit or tradition.
OL,14,FThis week ITV 1 reintroduced idents
OL,15,Fbefore their key morning programmes.
OL,16,FHowever the idents are voiced by
OL,17,Fprogramme presenters ` not announcers.

OL,5,
OL,6,FMost TV channels in the UK and Ireland
OL,7,Ffollow the same convention ` an ident
OL,8,Fwith a voiceover (either live or
OL,9,Frecorded) precedes virtually all
OL,10,Fprogrammes.
OL,12,FOf course, this is a relatively new
OL,13,Fconvention which was an evolution of
OL,14,Fthe standard BBC practice in the 60s
OL,15,Fand 70s.
OL,17,FIt was not unusual on ITV back then to
OL,18,Fgo straight from a trail or advert into
OL,19,Fthe pre-programme ident ` or frontcap `
OL,20,Fof the production company.

OL,5,
OL,6,FOccasionally there was no form of

OL,10,Fif this practice wasn't specifically
OL,11,Fprohibited.
OL,13,FFor the same reason, some ITV regions
OL,14,Flooked a little messy initially after
OL,15,Fproduction company idents were
OL,16,Fwithdrawn in 1988.
OL,18,FSoon most regions realised how this
OL,19,Flooked and a local ident or in-vision

OL,5,
OL,6,FIn the case of a channel like BBC One,
OL,7,Fthe feeling that a live announcer is
OL,8,Fwatching live with the audience helps
OL,9,Fto lift the channel above the others.
OL,10,FThe channel is a living, breathing,
OL,11,Freactive thing ` not a streamed video.
OL,13,FI also think that spoken announcements
OL,14,Fare the best way of ensuring Ofcom

OL,17,FYes, you can argue for captions or
