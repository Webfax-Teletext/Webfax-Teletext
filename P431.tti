OL,8,Ffrom April, as the government has
OL,9,Fapproved plans to allow the unusually

OL,12,FLocal authorities such as Somerset
OL,13,FCouncil are usually only allowed to
OL,14,Fraise council tax by a maximum of
OL,15,Faround 5%.
OL,17,FBut many councils are facing
OL,18,Fthemselves in dire financial positions
OL,19,Fand all must legally balance their
OL,20,Fbudgets before the beginning of the
OL,21,Fnew financial year in the spring.

OL,9,Fwhich it says is being caused in a

OL,13,FIt's led to the council asking for

OL,16,Ffive others around the UK, it has now
OL,17,Fbeen given permission to do so.
