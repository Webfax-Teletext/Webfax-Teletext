OL,7,Ftoday for a visit highlighting the
OL,8,Fcity's position at the forefront of
OL,9,Fsustainable technology and scientific
OL,10,Finnovation.
OL,12,FPrince William's first stop was at
OL,13,F'Matter', a Bristol-based company and
OL,14,F2025 Earthshot Prize finalist, where
OL,15,Fhe witnessed their groundbreaking
OL,16,Ffiltration technology designed to
OL,17,Fprevent microplastics from entering

OL,6,FThe company demonstrated how their
OL,7,Fsystem captures harmful microfibres
OL,8,Fbefore they reach the water supply.
OL,10,FThe visit held particular
OL,11,Fsignificance, as founder Adam's
OL,12,Fentrepreneurial journey began with a
OL,13,F#250 grant from the Prince's Trust
OL,14,Fmore than eight years ago.
OL,16,FPrince William has already installed
OL,17,Fthe filtration system in his own
OL,18,Fhousehold, purchasing it at full
OL,19,Fprice, and the systems are now being
OL,20,Frolled out across all royal palaces.

OL,6,FDuring a demonstration of machinery
OL,7,Fthat removes microfibres during
OL,8,Ftextile manufacturing, the Prince
OL,9,Fexpressed his dismay at the volume of
OL,10,Fwaste produced.
OL,12,F"I'm genuinely horrified," he said,
OL,13,Fwatching the waste accumulate. "It's
OL,14,Fabsolutely atrocious that we allow
OL,15,Fthat. Companies must have known how
OL,16,Fmuch stuff they are washing away."
OL,18,FThe Prince then travelled to the
OL,19,FUniversity of Bristol to visit
OL,20,FIsambard-AI, the UK's most powerful
OL,21,Fsupercomputer.
