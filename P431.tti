OL,7,FBristol Crown Court heard Bowen, who
OL,8,Fhas since been diagnosed with paranoid

OL,10,Facute episode of psychosis at the time.
OL,12,FSentencing him at Bristol Crown Court,
OL,13,FJudge Julian Lambert said Bowen was
OL,14,Fsuffering from religious delusions
OL,15,Fwhen he attacked his wife and was
OL,16,F"labouring under the false belief that
OL,17,Fthe world was coming to an end".
OL,19,FBowen's defence counsel said he
OL,20,Fexperienced "bewilderment" at his

OL,10,F"loving and nurturing".
OL,12,F"She had friends across the world and
OL,13,Fwas a beacon of hope and probity to

OL,17,FThe judge said: "I find it difficult

OL,19,Ftragedy in this case. This was the
OL,20,Fultimate betrayal of your wife.
