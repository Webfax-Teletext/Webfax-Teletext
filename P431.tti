OL,8,FIt's 8am on a Friday morning and I've
OL,9,Fjust arrived at the Yeovil Ambulance
OL,10,FStation. The building is quite
OL,11,Funglamorous, a late 1960s or 1970s
OL,12,Fconstruction that you could quite
OL,13,Feasily drive past and not give a
OL,14,Fsecond glance.
OL,16,FIt's actually rather ironic that very
OL,17,Frecently I was the one needing the
OL,18,Fassistance of the paramedics when my
OL,19,Ffather had a suspected heart attack.

OL,13,Ffather just a couple of weeks before,
OL,14,Fonly this time I'm seeing it from the

OL,17,FWhen we arrive at the rural location,
OL,18,Fwe're greeted by Jane, who directs us
OL,19,Fto Reg, who says he was having chest
OL,20,Fpains after dinner but feels a bit
OL,21,Fbetter than he did.

OL,10,FWith the tests done, Liz and Lyndsey
OL,11,Fcan't be sure if the pains are due to

OL,13,Fand the trip to the hospital was the
OL,14,Fonly way to be sure.
OL,16,FSomething Reg was visibly unsure about
OL,17,Fdoing, due to the stories of excessive
OL,18,Fwaiting times in A&E. This seemed to
OL,19,Fbe a common concern amongst many of
OL,20,Fthe patients I had met today.
