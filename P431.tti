OL,6,FThe chair of the festival, Julie
OL,7,FGraham, said the event started small,
OL,8,Fso to get to 20 years "is such an
OL,9,Fachievement."
OL,11,FShe said "We are completely volunteer
OL,12,Frun and we are a not-for-profit
OL,13,Ffestival so there is no
OL,14,Fcommercialisation at all with us.
OL,16,F"What you see is what you get really.
OL,17,FWe are supported heavily by local
OL,18,Fchefs and chefs from far away. Many
OL,19,Ffriends of the festival come every
OL,20,Fyear and enjoy it and we wouldn't be
OL,21,Fable to do it without their support."
