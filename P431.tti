OL,7,Fmost fantastic organisation. Although
OL,8,Fthey are a hospice, they also care for
OL,9,Fchildren with life-limiting conditions.
OL,11,F"Something which is really very
OL,12,Fspecial about Julia's House is they
OL,13,Fdon't just care for the poorly child,
OL,14,Fthey care for the entire family.
OL,16,F"Often when you have a sick child, a
OL,17,Flot of attention gets drawn onto that
OL,18,Fchild and the siblings can feel
OL,19,Fslightly pushed out so what Julia's
OL,20,FHouse does is they include the entire
OL,21,Ffamily in what they do.
