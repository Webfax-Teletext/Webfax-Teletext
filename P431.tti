OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV News West Country,
OL,7,FJosh explained what goes into taking
OL,8,Fsuch a spectacular photo: "I usually
OL,9,Fdo a recce of the site first. I wanted
OL,10,Fto check if I could access the land
OL,11,Fand luckily there were foot paths.
OL,13,F"There was mostly terrible weather in
OL,14,FJanuary but one day at the end of the
OL,15,Fmonth, the night sky was a lot clearer.
OL,17,F"At about 1am, I set up in front of
OL,18,Fthe skeleton of the Pyramid stage and
OL,19,Ftook multiple photos over 45 minutes."

OL,6,FWhen asked what he hopes people will

OL,8,Freally want people to look at this as

OL,10,Fconnection between astronomy, music
OL,11,Fand art.
OL,13,F"Art conjures up different ideas and
