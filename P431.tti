OL,7,FSpeaking to ITV News West Country, Mr
OL,8,FMalone explained: "We desperately need
OL,9,Fto relieve the suffering of those who,
OL,10,Fright now, are lying in hospitals, who
OL,11,Fknow that there is no way out.
OL,13,F"They only face death, and would like
OL,14,Fto cut short their own suffering."
OL,16,FMr Malone was already campaigning on
OL,17,Fthe issue back in 2024, when he
OL,18,Fdescribed the final four weeks of his
OL,19,Ffather's life like "something out of a
OL,20,Fhorror film".

OL,9,Fwas left "a beaten husk of a man,
