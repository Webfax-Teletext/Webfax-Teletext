OL,10,FThere are many unusual traditions that
OL,11,Fhave lived on for centuries in
OL,12,FCornwall and perhaps the game of
OL,13,F"Hurling the Silverball" is one of the
OL,14,Fstrangest.
OL,16,FThe ancient sport used to be played in
OL,17,Ftowns and villages across the
OL,18,Fpeninsular but just two towns are
OL,19,Fknown to continue to play the game.

OL,8,Fgame in mid Cornwall two teams, town
OL,9,Fversus country, compete to carry the
OL,10,Fball over the parish boundary a mile
OL,11,Faway from the start.
OL,13,FColin Rescorla is the third generation
OL,14,Fto make the silver ball needed for the
OL,15,Fgame. He says there is "considerable
OL,16,Fglory" in winning the ball and
OL,17,Foutsiders are in "total disbelief" at
OL,18,Fthe chaos of the rough game.

OL,10,FThe ball is made from a core of
OL,11,Fapplewood and covered by two sides of
OL,12,Fsilver with the words "TOWN AND
