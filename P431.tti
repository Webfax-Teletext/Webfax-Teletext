OL,6,FIn February everything changed when

OL,8,Fwere being removed from the car park
OL,9,Fbecause an agent was taking control of
OL,10,Fit.
OL,12,FMargaret and Peter say they were given
OL,13,Fless than two months to find

OL,16,FMargaret said: "All the other options
OL,17,Fwe were given wouldn't work though. On-
OL,18,Fstreet parking isn't an option because
OL,19,Fthere's no space.
