OL,7,FA coroner has highlighted a series of
OL,8,F"missed opportunities" which could
OL,9,Fhave contributed to the death of a
OL,10,Fbaby at Derriford hospital.
OL,12,FGiles Cooper-Hall was just 16 hours
OL,13,Fold when he died.
OL,15,FThe coroner today (Friday 2 February)
OL,16,Fsummed up how his mother's care plan
OL,17,Fwas not followed, and while it may not
OL,18,Fhave made a difference in saving
OL,19,FGiles' life, she said: "we do not know
OL,20,Fwhat could have been".

OL,13,FRuth Cooper-Hall was 41 weeks into her
