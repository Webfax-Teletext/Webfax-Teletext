OL,6,FSpeaking about launching the tours,
OL,7,FSean said: "Ever since coming to work
OL,8,Fat the cathedral, I've always wanted
OL,9,Fto go up into the roof. And it took me
OL,10,Fabout a year to convince anyone to
OL,11,Factually take me up into the roof
OL,12,Fspaces. And from there, I was kind of
OL,13,Fhooked on it.
OL,15,F"But why should I be the only person
OL,16,Fwho has the privilege of seeing all
OL,17,Fthe things that happen up there that
OL,18,Fmost people don't get to see? So a big
OL,19,Fpart of it was wanting to open up the
OL,20,Fcathedral to everybody else."
