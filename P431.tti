OL,6,FA community in Devon has been left
OL,7,F'heartbroken' after a 700-year-old oak
OL,8,Ftree fell down.
OL,10,FThe Silverton Oak has stood in the
OL,11,Fplaying fields of The Rec for
OL,12,Fcenturies and has come to be known as
OL,13,Fa symbol of the village.
OL,15,F"It's heartbreaking. That afternoon I
OL,16,Fwas drawn to the tree and I couldn't
OL,17,Fstop myself," Miles Snowden, a local
OL,18,Fresident said.

OL,6,F"There were tears and I'm welling up a

OL,8,Fsignificant part of Silverton's life
OL,9,Ffor hundreds of years. It was like a
OL,10,Fguardian."
OL,12,FThe oak tree stood as a historic
OL,13,Fmonument for the mid-Devonshire town
OL,14,Fwhich has significance for local
OL,15,Fresidents like David Wright.
OL,17,FHe said: "I was just looking up and I
OL,18,Fsaw the tree suddenly just start to
OL,19,Fslowly tip over.

OL,6,F"I couldn't believe it because this
OL,7,Ftree has been part of the village for
OL,8,Flonger than I've been here so it's
OL,9,Fbeen an old friend for a long time.
OL,11,F"I've always known that I guess that

OL,13,Fthrough the end of its life but never

OL,19,FParish Council on Monday 29 January to
OL,20,Fhelp decide how the tree's legacy can
