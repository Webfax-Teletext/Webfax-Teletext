OL,10,FIsabelle O'Shea, known as on social

OL,12,Fthe Berry Head area.
OL,14,FAfter some waiting around, she spotted
OL,15,Fthe pod and they decided to race her
OL,16,Fback to the shore.
OL,18,FShe said on Facebook: "After what felt
OL,19,Flike a very long winter, I went out
OL,20,Ffor my first paddle of the year last

OL,6,F"I decided to head out to Berry Head
OL,7,Fafter carefully checking out the tides

OL,10,F15 minutes.
OL,12,F"It was such a beautiful evening I
OL,13,Fdecided to wait for a while whilst
OL,14,Fwatching guillemots fly over my head

OL,6,F"Common dolphins are generally quite
