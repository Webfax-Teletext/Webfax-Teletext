OL,7,Fmarked the start of construction of a
OL,8,Fnew outpatients department at West

OL,11,FThe new #9m unit is expected to
OL,12,Fprovide more modern, accessible and
OL,13,Fspacious facilities for patients.
OL,15,FIt could also prevent patients in the
OL,16,Fwest of Cornwall from having to travel
OL,17,Fto Truro or Plymouth for treatment.

OL,7,FHospitals Trust Steve Williamson told
OL,8,FITV News: "The current facility is
OL,9,Freally old, very dated and is really
OL,10,Fcramped as well. What we'll get is a
OL,11,Ffantastic state of the art facility, a
OL,12,Fmuch better environment for our
OL,13,Fpatients, and much better environment
OL,14,Ffor our staff. It will be digitally
OL,15,Fenabled as well, so in addition to the
OL,16,Fin-person outpatient appointments,
OL,17,Fwe'll be able to do virtual outpatient
OL,18,Fappointments so in some instances
OL,19,Fthey'll be able to receive that care
OL,20,Fhere using virtual technology."
