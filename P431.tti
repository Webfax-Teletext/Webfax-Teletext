OL,11,FAnne Jappie, from Cheltenham, wants to

OL,13,Fneurodegenerative conditions mean that

OL,7,Fpoint where I think I can't do this

OL,9,Fwith dignity and tranquility and calm
OL,10,F- maybe with a final blast - here at

OL,13,FAssisted dying is illegal in the UK.
OL,14,FBut a bill introduced to Parliament on
OL,15,FWednesday 16 October could give
OL,16,Fterminally ill people the right to end

OL,10,F"It would be so reassuring," she told
