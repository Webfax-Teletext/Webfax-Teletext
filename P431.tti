OL,12,FShe said: "These new dates are really
OL,13,Fexciting for a number of reasons.
OL,14,FFirstly, it means the monument is now
OL,15,Fwell-dated using modern, reliable
OL,16,Ftechniques so we can trust them.
OL,18,F"Secondly, they show that Woodhenge
OL,19,Fwas built in at least two phases, with
OL,20,Fthe henge being built around 150-200
OL,21,Fyears later than the timber rings.
