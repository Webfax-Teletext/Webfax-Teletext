OL,6,FThe Lizard's lifeboat station decided
OL,7,Fto send the Tamar all-weather
OL,8,Flifeboat, Rose, to meet the yacht as
OL,9,FCoxswain Andrew Putt decided there was
OL,10,Fa "risk to life and danger to

OL,13,FHe decided the safest option was to
OL,14,Ftow the yacht to the nearest harbour
OL,15,Fin Newlyn - but this proved difficult
OL,16,Fas the yacht began to sway left and
OL,17,Fright meaning both boats could only
OL,18,Ftravel at two knots at times.
