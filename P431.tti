OL,6,FDI Nadine Partridge said: "This case

OL,9,Fmental ill health and has been unable
OL,10,Fto instruct defence lawyers in line
OL,11,Fwith their right to a fair trial.
OL,13,F"The delay has understandably taken a
OL,14,Ftoll on Isaac's family. They have had
OL,15,Fto mark the anniversary of his death
OL,16,Fand what would have been his 62nd
OL,17,Fbirthday and their wait continues.
