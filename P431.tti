OL,6,FIn terms of what fishing provides for
OL,7,Fthe UK economy, it's relatively small,
OL,8,Fbut it's also not to be sniffed at,
OL,9,Fand it's important. According to the
OL,10,FOffice for National Statistics (ONS),
OL,11,Fthe sector contributes around 0.03% of
OL,12,FGDP.
OL,14,FSo for every #1,000 of total economic
OL,15,Foutput, around 30p.
OL,17,FBut it provides a critical source of
