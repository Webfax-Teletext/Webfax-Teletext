OL,17,Fwhat is often described as a "false

OL,7,FCharlie Powell, ITV West Country
OL,8,Fweather presenter, said: "While not
OL,9,Factually marking the early onset of
OL,10,Four next season, the trees and plants
OL,11,Fare, in fact, responding to weather
OL,12,Fextremes."
OL,14,FHe explained that the heatwave,
OL,15,Fcombined with reduced rainfall, has
OL,16,Fpushed trees into "survival mode,"
OL,17,Fwith leaves changing colour and
OL,18,Ffalling off due to stress.

OL,10,F"Although not dying, they're not

OL,14,FHe added that the ongoing impacts of
