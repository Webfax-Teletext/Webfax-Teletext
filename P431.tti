OL,6,FCasting his mind back to 2016, Mr
OL,7,FPerrins explained: "I had got to a
OL,8,Fpoint in time where my older family
OL,9,Fhad all left the planet.
OL,11,F"I realised I'd nothing to do and I
OL,12,Fhad a bit of spare money. I thought I
OL,13,Fcould go out and buy a nice car - or I
OL,14,Fcould buy a boat. So that's what I did.
OL,16,F"I just thought, 'I'll go off and sail
OL,17,Fas far as I can and then I got a
OL,18,FYouTube channel going and that helped
OL,19,Fit continue. I just kept going and now
OL,20,FI'm back to close the loop."
