OL,6,FHead gardener Nick Haworth says the
OL,7,F'snowdrop surprise' is not uncommon in
OL,8,Fhot countries in southern Europe.
OL,10,FHe said: "We've got around 400
OL,11,Fvarieties of snowdrops at The Garden
OL,12,FHouse, and while it's not unusual to
OL,13,Fsee the odd Mediterranean snowdrop
OL,14,Fpopping its head up in autumn, we've
OL,15,Fnever seen so many in October.
OL,17,F"It's pretty clear that the reason is
OL,18,Fthe long dry summer followed by autumn
OL,19,Frainfall. This is close to the
OL,20,Fconditions these snowdrop varieties
OL,21,Fexperience in their natural habitats."
