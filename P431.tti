OL,6,FNathan is calling on the Government to
OL,7,Flower VAT rates, and address what he
OL,8,Fsees as an unfair system which
OL,9,Fpenalises successful salons.J"Most

OL,11,Femployed don't pay VAT," he said.
OL,12,F"They keep themselves under that
OL,13,Fthreshold. I cannot do that. So that
OL,14,Fmodel needs to change because there's
OL,15,F27 per cent of us that are left in the
OL,16,FUK who employ our staff and pay more
OL,17,Ftax than the 73 per cent that are left
OL,18,Fover. That's not fair."JA spokesman
OL,19,Ffor HM Treasury said: "Our decisive
OL,20,Faction helped to more than halve
