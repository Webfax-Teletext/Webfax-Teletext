OL,6,FThe rescuers say the calf is the

OL,9,FA spokesperson from the BDMLR said:
OL,10,F"The calf is in poor nutritional
OL,11,Fcondition, displaying an elevated
OL,12,Frespiratory rate, with no sign of any
OL,13,Faccompanying adult whales.
OL,15,F"This strongly indicates maternal
OL,16,Fseparation, a situation in which
OL,17,Fsurvival is not possible for such a
OL,18,Fyoung animal. A calf of this age is
OL,19,Fcompletely dependent on the mother for
OL,20,Ffrequent feeding and cannot survive
OL,21,Findependently at sea.
