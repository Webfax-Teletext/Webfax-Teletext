OL,7,FAn expert at Plymouth University is
OL,8,Fwarning over the increasing risk of
OL,9,Fcliff collapses along the Devon and
OL,10,FDorset coastline, following a recent
OL,11,Fseries of rockfalls that have pushed
OL,12,Fhomes dangerously close to the edge.
OL,14,FAn historic thatched cottage has been
OL,15,Fleft teetering just 40 feet from a
OL,16,Fcliff edge near Sidmouth, following a
OL,17,Frockfall over the weekend of October

OL,7,FAccording to Dr. Poate, the threat
OL,8,Fcomes not only from increased wave
OL,9,Faction but also from varying weather
OL,10,Fconditions, as cliffs can weaken and
OL,11,Fcollapse due to heavy rain or
