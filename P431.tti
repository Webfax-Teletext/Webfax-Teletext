OL,7,FThere are no plans to reverse the

OL,10,Fadmitting that the government impact

OL,13,FIn an interview with ITV West Country,
OL,14,FSir Keir Starmer ruled out any
OL,15,Fpossible tweaks to the policy, which
OL,16,Fwill see agricultural assets worth

OL,18,Fhalf the usual rate - from April 2026.
