OL,12,FHedgehog Rescue explained: "We had a
OL,13,Fcall on Monday to say that a man on a
OL,14,Fbus had seen a hedgehog, which was a
OL,15,Flittle odd seeing as the hedgehog was
OL,16,Fin the field and they're usually quite

OL,8,Fspotted her and brought her in on
OL,9,FTuesday (16th April).
OL,11,F"We immediately deflated her because
OL,12,Fshe was so big, her skin was so tight.
OL,13,FShe couldn't curl up, she couldn't
OL,14,Fwalk because her legs were trapped.
OL,16,F"We took her to the vets. We could see
OL,17,Fsome blood on her head. There are lots
OL,18,Fof things that can cause balloon
OL,19,Fsyndrome, so we wanted to make sure

OL,6,F"We think she had a wound that became

OL,8,Fbut hedgehogs have a unique structure
OL,9,Fwhere they have skin, a gap, and then
OL,10,Ftheir muscular skeletal structure

OL,13,F"When that becomes infected, the wound
OL,14,Freleases gas, and if its trapped, the
OL,15,Fhedgehog expands.
OL,17,F"It can also be caused by respiratory
OL,18,Fissues, but in this case her X-rays
OL,19,Fwere clear."

OL,6,FEmily said that Bounce's size was
OL,7,Fshocking and the centre only sees a
OL,8,Fcase like this around once a year.
OL,10,FShe added: "We take in around five

OL,12,Fonly see around one like this.
OL,14,F"What we do see this time of year is
OL,15,Feveryone going out and cutting their
OL,16,Fgrass and lots of hedgehogs being
OL,17,Finjured by strimmers.
OL,19,F"We've had three hedgehogs in over the
