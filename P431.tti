OL,6,FNoting the book's connection to the
OL,7,FRoyal Navy, Mr Berry passed the book
OL,8,Fonto volunteers, Richard Danns, who is
OL,9,Fa retired marine engineer, and Stuart
OL,10,FMurray, who thoroughly researched the
OL,11,Fbook, before placing it on Oxfam's
OL,12,Fonline shop.
OL,14,FThey quickly realised just how special
OL,15,Fthe book was when several historians
OL,16,Fstarted to ring the store.
OL,18,FThe National Museum for the Royal Navy
OL,19,Fin Portsmouth bought the book for an
OL,20,Fundisclosed four figure sum and has
OL,21,Fnow placed it in its collection.

OL,6,FMr Berry, 62, said: "I found the book
OL,7,Fat the end of the year among other
OL,8,Fdonations in the back room. I knew the
OL,9,Fbook was something to take note of
OL,10,Fbecause it had the lead-lined cover,
OL,11,Fso it looked quite obscure.
OL,13,F"But I don't think we realised quite
OL,14,Fhow special it was until we started
OL,15,Fgetting calls from historians telling
OL,16,Fus how important it was.
OL,18,F"It felt like you were holding a piece
OL,19,Fof history in your hands.
