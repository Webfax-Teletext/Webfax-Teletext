OL,6,FDan Jarvis, from BDMLR, said: "We're
OL,7,Fseeing a gradual increase of (striped

OL,9,Fof climate change and sea temperatures
OL,10,Frising.
OL,12,F"In the last 20 years, there's been an
OL,13,Fincrease, we see one or two (striped
OL,14,Fdolphin) strandings a year, and
OL,15,Fthere's a slight increase in other

OL,6,FMany stranded striped dolphins in the

OL,13,Fwas assessed to be in moderate
