OL,6,FA Plymouth family has launched a

OL,8,Fcell donor.
OL,10,FPhilip Charlesworth is living with
OL,11,Fstage 4 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, an
OL,12,Fextremely rare form of cancer. In the
OL,13,Flast year or so it has spread to his
OL,14,Fbloodstream and he needs three weekly
OL,15,Fchemotherapy treatments to keep it in
OL,16,Fcheck.
OL,18,FA stem cell transplant could be the
OL,19,Fanswer, but despite searching for 12
OL,20,Fmonths for a suitable donor, so far
OL,21,Fthey have drawn a blank.
