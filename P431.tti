OL,15,Fwhen he came into the West Hatch

OL,17,Fwho were struggling with the number of

OL,7,FOnce in the animal rescue centre's
OL,8,Fcare, "it became clear he had severe
OL,9,Fcat flu which had damaged his right

OL,11,Fcharity said.
OL,13,FAfter recovering from surgery
OL,14,F"extremely well", Bertie was adopted
OL,15,Fby Hannah Lawson, from Taunton, who
OL,16,Fsaid he quickly became "part of the

OL,11,Floving, and will jump up almost

OL,14,F"Being a one-eyed cat doesn't affect
OL,15,Fhim too much," Mrs Lawson added.
