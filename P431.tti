OL,7,FDr Laura Palmer, who manages the brain

OL,9,Fshrinks the human brain.
OL,11,FShe said: "It's really important for

OL,13,Freason why people with dementia behave
OL,14,Fthe way they do is because of a loss
OL,15,Fof brain tissue. It's a physical
OL,16,Fdisease.
OL,18,F"But because we can't see it while
OL,19,Fpeople are living, it's quite easy to
OL,20,Fthink about it as a mental condition
OL,21,Fwhich you can control - but you can't."
