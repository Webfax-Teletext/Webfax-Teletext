OL,6,FThe ASA said it was not clear to
OL,7,Fcustomers that the pop-ups were coming
OL,8,Ffrom a third party, and that by
OL,9,Fclicking "continue" some people would
OL,10,Fhave thought they were finalising
OL,11,Ftheir transaction with the retailer.
OL,13,FConsumers may also have been led to
OL,14,Fbelieve that they had earned a free
OL,15,Fcashback reward based on the order
OL,16,Fthey had just placed.
OL,18,FThe ASA said this was not the case,
OL,19,Fand therefore found that the adverts
OL,20,Fwere likely to mislead people.
