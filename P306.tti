OL,7,Fvaping? ITV News explains.
OL,9,FCan the vapour from e-cigarettes harm

OL,12,FThe NHS website says there is "no

OL,16,FThat's different from secondhand smoke

OL,15,F"Because vaping does not involve
OL,16,Fcombustion, bystanders are not exposed

OL,6,FWhat is the difference between

OL,10,FThe key difference is combustion, Dr

OL,13,F"Cigarettes burn tobacco, producing
OL,14,Fsmoke that contains thousands of

OL,6,FDr Tattan-Birch said the government's

OL,15,Fis likely to be very low because it
OL,16,Fdisperses quickly, so the direct
