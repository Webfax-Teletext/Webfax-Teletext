OL,11,FThe shower happens annually and this

OL,6,FThe meteor shower is unique in that
OL,7,Fvisibility is best in the evening,
OL,8,Frather than in the early hours of the
OL,9,Fmorning, and the bright lights can be
OL,10,Fseen with the naked eye.
OL,12,FIt tends to be less active than other
OL,13,Fshowers, with around ten meteors
OL,14,Fexpected to be seen per hour. They are
OL,15,Falso slower than others - so they will

OL,3,CDraconid meteor shower: What is it and

OL,6,FMeteor showers occur as our planet
OL,7,Fpasses through debris trails left
OL,8,Fbehind by comets and asteroids, which
OL,9,Feject bits of rock and ice as they
OL,10,Forbit the sun.
OL,12,FThe Draconids are the result of Earth
OL,13,Fintersecting with such a trail from
OL,14,Fthe comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner when it
OL,15,Fnears the comet's orbit in October
OL,16,Feach year.
OL,18,FThe shower gets its name because the
OL,19,Fmeteors appear to be coming from the
OL,20,Fdirection of the constellation Draco
OL,21,Fthe Dragon.

OL,6,FHow can I see it?
OL,8,FDraconids are best seen in the evening
OL,9,Fafter nightfall, rather than in the
OL,10,Fearly hours of the morning.
OL,12,FObserving conditions are predicted to
OL,13,Fbe good on Tuesday as the shower
OL,14,Foccurs just before the moon's first
OL,15,Fquarter phase, so even faint meteors
OL,16,Fwill be easier to see.
OL,18,FFor the best view of the shower, try
OL,19,Fto find somewhere with little light
OL,20,Fpollution and an unobstructed horizon,
OL,21,Fthe Royal Museums Greenwich recommends.
