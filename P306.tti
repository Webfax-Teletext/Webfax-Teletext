OL,6,FThe announcement is expected to be in
OL,7,Fline with the calls made by Sarah
OL,8,FChampion last week. Champion wrote a

OL,11,Faround the country to hold authorities
OL,12,Fto account - which then report back to

OL,15,FPart of her reasoning for demanding
OL,16,Fsuch inquiries was so they could
OL,17,Fsummon witnesses to give evidence, in
OL,18,Forder to "satisfy the public concern
OL,19,Fof cover-ups". It's unclear whether
OL,20,Fthe government announcement will
OL,21,Finclude such powers.
