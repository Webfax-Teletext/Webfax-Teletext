OL,8,Ffirst time, a part of the planet where
OL,9,Fit was thought impossible for water

OL,12,FThe "astonishing" discovery confirms

OL,6,FValantinas said: "We thought it was
OL,7,Fimpossible for frost to form around
OL,8,FMars's equator, as the mix of sunshine
OL,9,Fand thin atmosphere keeps temperatures
OL,10,Frelatively high at both surface and
OL,11,Fmountaintop ` unlike what we see on
OL,12,FEarth, where you might expect to see
OL,13,Ffrosty peaks."
OL,15,FThe newly discovered patches of frost
OL,16,Fare present for a few hours around
OL,17,Fsunrise before they evaporate in
OL,18,Fsunlight.
OL,20,FDespite being as thin as a human hair,
OL,21,Fthey cover a vast area.
