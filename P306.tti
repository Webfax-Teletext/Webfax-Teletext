OL,7,FDonald Trump had billed the
OL,8,Fconversation with Elon Musk as the
OL,9,F"interview of the century."
OL,11,FIt was hosted on Musk's X platform,
OL,12,Fformerly known as Twitter, bringing
OL,13,Ftogether two of the world's most
OL,14,Fpolarising and controversial men in
OL,15,Fone of the most divisive social media
OL,16,Fspaces.
OL,18,FBut instead of being a riveting
OL,19,Fexchange, it began with a technical
OL,20,Ffiasco. For over 30 minutes X users
OL,21,Fcouldn't even access the conversation.
