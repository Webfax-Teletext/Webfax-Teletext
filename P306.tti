OL,8,FThis morning, the Chancellor confirmed
OL,9,Fshe will deliver the Budget, her
OL,10,Fsecond, on Wednesday, November 26.
OL,12,FHer first Budget last October was
OL,13,Fsupposed to be a "let's-get-it-done-
OL,14,Fand-dusted" moment: an event where she
OL,15,Fset out all of the tax and spending

OL,18,Fpublic services for the duration of
