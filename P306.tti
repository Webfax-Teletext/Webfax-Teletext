OL,7,Fpaused to remember the 15 people who
OL,8,Fdied in the antisemitic Bondi terror
OL,9,Fattack.
OL,11,FPeople were asked to observe a
OL,12,Fminute's silence and light a candle in
OL,13,Ftheir windows, with the theme of the
OL,14,Fremembrance event being "Light Will
OL,15,FWin."
OL,17,FOn December 14 last year, two
OL,18,Fterrorists shattered the joy at a
OL,19,FHanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach,
OL,20,Fopening fire on a large gathering of
OL,21,FJewish families.
