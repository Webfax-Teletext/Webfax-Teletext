OL,9,FA rare and bright comet last seen from
OL,10,FEarth about 80,000 years ago will be
OL,11,Fvisible from the UK this weekend.
OL,13,FThe Comet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) will
OL,14,Fmake its closest approach to the
OL,15,FNorthern Hemisphere on Saturday, when
OL,16,Fit offers stargazers the best chance
OL,17,Fto see it with the naked eye.

OL,6,FAlthough it will be visible for about
OL,7,Ftwo weeks from Friday night when it
OL,8,Fzooms within 44 million miles (71

OL,10,Fbest view is likely to be on October
OL,11,F12.
OL,13,FWith a 80,000-year orbit, the comet
OL,14,Fwould have last been seen when our

OL,6,FDr Robert Massey, deputy executive
OL,7,Fdirector at the Royal Astronomical
OL,8,FSociety, said the comet was
OL,9,Fphotographed in British skies in
OL,10,FSeptember "but was too low to see with
OL,11,Fthe eye".
OL,13,FThis latest flyby came at "quite a
OL,14,Ftime, given the aurora last night and
OL,15,Fthe prospect of a bright comet", he
OL,16,Fsaid.
OL,18,FThe comet will be visible in the west
OL,19,Fafter sunset, Dr Massey said. It will
OL,20,Fappear higher each night over the next
OL,21,Ffew weeks before fading.

OL,10,FApps like Stellarium can help you

OL,6,FCan I see it with the naked eye?JThere
OL,7,Fis a chance the comet may be visible
OL,8,Fto the naked eye, although you stand a

OL,13,FSeveral comets are discovered every

OL,15,Flinger too far away to be visible
OL,16,Fwithout special equipment. After its

OL,9,F"You need a clear sky, fairly

OL,6,FComets are frozen debris from the

OL,8,Fyears ago. They heat up as they head
