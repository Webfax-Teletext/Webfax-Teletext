OL,6,FMs Daniels, whose real name is

OL,8,Fone-night stand with Trump in 2006.
OL,9,FThe controversy surfaced in January
OL,10,F2018, when the Wall Street Journal
OL,11,Freported on the $130,000 (#104,000)
OL,12,Fpayment.
OL,14,FProsecutors in New York have alleged
OL,15,Fthat Trump sought to undermine the
OL,16,Fintegrity of the 2016 election by
OL,17,Fsuppressing negative information that
OL,18,Fwould hurt his campaign.

OL,6,FSpeaking from the stand, Daniels said
OL,7,Fshe met Trump at a golf tournament in

OL,9,Fencounter".
OL,11,FShe alleges Trump's bodyguard gave

OL,16,FOn the advice of her publicist,

OL,18,FTrump. She says she arrived at a hotel
OL,19,Froom, where his bodyguard had said
OL,20,Fthey would meet before going to dinner.
