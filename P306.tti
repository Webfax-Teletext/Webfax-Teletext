OL,3,CWhy recession is now 'the base case'
OL,5,FAs the febrile financial markets
OL,6,Fawaken again in Tokyo, it's clear that
OL,7,Fthe next 48 hours will be critical in
OL,8,Fdeciding whether the US can avoid a
OL,9,Frecession and the world a painful
OL,10,Fgrowth deceleration.
OL,12,FBecause Trump and his record-breaking
OL,13,Ftariffs - and China's tit-for-tat
OL,14,Fretaliation - have forced a triple
OL,15,Fwhammy on the US.
OL,17,FHit number one is the tariffs
OL,18,Fthemselves, which put up the costs of
OL,19,Fgoods and foods, and crush the income
OL,20,Fof consumers and businesses.

OL,5,FHit number two is the uncertainty
OL,6,Faround which tariffs are negotiable
OL,7,Fand which are set in stone.
OL,9,FThe uncertainty makes it very
OL,10,Fdifficult for consumers and businesses
OL,11,Fto make big purchases and big
OL,12,Finvestment - because they can't know
OL,13,Fif the items will be a fifth cheaper
OL,14,Fagain in just a few weeks, or where in
OL,15,Fthe world demand will turn out to be
OL,16,Fmore resilient or less resilient.
