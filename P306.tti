OL,9,Ftax 'given tax burdens have been
OL,10,Fpushed up since 2010'
OL,12,FSunak's election strategy is old-
OL,13,Ffashioned.
OL,15,FIt's a promise (bribe) of employees,

OL,6,FHis hope is that significant numbers
OL,7,Fof them, who may be thinking of voting
OL,8,FLabour or Reform, will instead put an
OL,9,FX next to the Tory candidate's name,
OL,10,Fonce they are in the privacy of the

OL,14,F"It's a slightly cynical bet on human

OL,18,FHe's right.

OL,6,FBut as I put to the PM in my question,
OL,7,Fthe strategy only works if voters
OL,8,Fbelieve the actions of the Tories in
OL,9,Fgovernment for 14 years, where they've
OL,10,Fbeen raising the burden of taxes to
OL,11,Flevels we've not experienced since the
OL,12,Flate 1940s, are an anomaly, and should
OL,13,Fnot be seen as a signifier of things
OL,14,Fto come.
OL,16,FIt is all about the credibility of jam
OL,17,Ftomorrow, and the credibility of Sunak
OL,18,Fas the jam maker.
