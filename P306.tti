OL,7,F"He said, 'Whoa! There's a dog down

OL,9,Fasked if it was alive, and he said
OL,10,F'Yes!'"
OL,12,FMr Rochette then climbed down into the
OL,13,Fcave with a piece of salami, and gave
OL,14,Fit to the dog.
OL,16,F"She instantly came over and sucked up
OL,17,Fthe salami and she loved that," he
OL,18,Fsaid.

OL,16,FShe was then taken to a vet, and is
