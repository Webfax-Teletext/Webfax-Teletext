OL,6,FKemi Badenoch has called for more
OL,7,FConservative councils to launch legal
OL,8,Fchallenges over asylum hotels as the
OL,9,Fgovernment faces a potential revolt
OL,10,Ffrom its own local authorities, as
OL,11,Fwell as opposition-led councils.
OL,13,FIt comes after the High Court ruled on
OL,14,FTuesday that asylum seekers should be
OL,15,Fremoved from the Bell Hotel, in
OL,16,FEpping, Essex, after a challenge from
OL,17,Fthe local Conservative council,
OL,18,Ffollowing a wave of anti-migrant
OL,19,Fprotests.
