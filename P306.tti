OL,9,FThousands of flights around the world
OL,10,Fhave been disrupted after a fire at an
OL,11,Felectrical substation forced Heathrow

OL,14,FThe fire has affected more than 1,300
OL,15,Fflights, a complete shutdown of the
OL,16,FUK's busiest airport and left
OL,17,Fthousands of homes without electricity.

OL,5,FThere are several big questions to
OL,6,Fanswer. How did the fire start, why
OL,7,Fwasn't there better power back up and
OL,8,Fhow long will it take to recover?
OL,10,FIt appears that it is one of three
OL,11,Fgiant transformers which caught fire.
OL,13,FThey 'step' power down from 275,000
OL,14,Fvolts to lower levels which can be
OL,15,Fused in homes.
OL,17,FDealing with such power creates heat
OL,18,Fso the transformer in question holds
OL,19,F25,000 litres of cooling oil. It's
OL,20,Fthis which is likely to have caught
OL,21,Ffire.

OL,7,FEngineering at University College
OL,8,FDublin: "I would anticipate that a

OL,12,Fwould hope that the traffic control

OL,18,Ftotality to consume a town's worth of
