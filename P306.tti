OL,7,FIn the coastal town of Black River,
OL,8,Fground zero in the aftermath of
OL,9,FHurricane Melissa, almost everyone we
OL,10,Fcame across was in need of food and
OL,11,Fsupplies.
OL,13,FThey had no choice but to search for
OL,14,Fit in the wreckage of local shops. The
OL,15,Flocal Jamaicans themselves called it
OL,16,Flooting. But they had no choice. It
OL,17,Fwas about survival.

OL,7,FWho would not take provisions from
OL,8,Funder the rubble when your children
OL,9,Fare hungry and thirsty, and the
OL,10,Fgovernment is failing?
OL,12,FJamaicans had been promised a speedy
OL,13,Fand globally-backed recovery effort.
OL,14,FBut so far we have seen no aid being
OL,15,Fdistributed.
OL,17,FA few helicopters fly overhead. Some
OL,18,Fwater trucks are navigating flooded
OL,19,Fand pot-holed roads. A handful of
OL,20,Ftroops and police are visible.

OL,10,FIt is exasperating to witness how the
