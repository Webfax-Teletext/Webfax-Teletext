OL,6,FIt is entirely possible his cancer has
OL,7,Fbeen caught early but we may also be
OL,8,Flooking at a scenario where this is
OL,9,Fnot an early identification but
OL,10,Fsomething more developed - and
OL,11,Ftherefore, more serious.
OL,13,FWe should also consider why , after

OL,16,Fin his book and his Netflix series, is
