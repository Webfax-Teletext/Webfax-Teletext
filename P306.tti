OL,8,Fwith 12 year-old Abdallah Kehil whose
OL,9,Fleg was saved from amputation after a
OL,10,Frocket landed in front of his school.
OL,11,FHe continues with bravery and
OL,12,Fundiminished dreams to become a model.
OL,14,FThe war in Gaza has continued for
OL,15,Fnearly 11 months, and throughout that
OL,16,Ftime we have heard often about how it
OL,17,Fhas affected its children - who make
OL,18,Fup half of the territory's population.

OL,7,FThey are experiencing death and
OL,8,Fdestruction daily, and quite often,
OL,9,Fwitnessing the unimaginable.
OL,11,FRecently, I went to Egypt to report on
OL,12,Fdesperately ill Palestinians who,
OL,13,Funtil May, were allowed to leave Gaza
OL,14,Fto go to Egypt, and elsewhere, for
OL,15,Fmedical treatment.

OL,19,FHospital talking to cancer patients
OL,20,Fand their doctors.

OL,7,FThroughout the day, unbeknownst to us,
OL,8,Fwe were being watched. It was only
OL,9,Fwhen we started to pack up did the
OL,10,Fcurious 12 year old observer make
OL,11,Fhimself known.
OL,13,FHis name was Abdallah Kehil, and his
OL,14,Fresilience and bravery astounded us,
OL,15,Fbut not only us, the Egyptian
OL,16,Fpresident too.
OL,18,FAs he moved along the corridors of the

OL,20,FAbdallah had an undeniable popularity
OL,21,Fand presence.

OL,7,FThe other children adored him. He
OL,8,Fsmiled often and they followed him
OL,9,Flike the Pied Piper. But, Abdallah's
OL,10,Fsmile hid horrors no 12 year old
OL,11,Fshould ever see. He wanted to share
OL,12,Fhis own story, about a school day in
OL,13,FNovember.
OL,15,F"We were bombed, a rocket hit us in
OL,16,Ffront of our school," he said.
OL,18,F"We were sitting down and suddenly the
OL,19,Fmissile struck us. My leg was blown
OL,20,Foff. My friends' bodies were
OL,21,Fscattered."

OL,7,FAbdallah crawled along the ground away
OL,8,Ffrom the devastation. Medics found him
OL,9,Fand carried him to hospital where he
OL,10,Fhad to fight for his own life. He'd

OL,13,FOnce his condition stabilised, he made

OL,9,Fshown on Egyptian state television, as
OL,10,Fhe was moved from ambulance to

OL,12,Fhe reached Cairo, and the Nasser

OL,15,FHe explained to me what they did to

OL,18,F"They took a muscle from my back and
