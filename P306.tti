OL,13,FWhy do people commemorate Arbaeen?
OL,15,FLiterally meaning '40' in Arabic, the
OL,16,FDay of Arbaeen marks 40 days after the
OL,17,FDay of Ashura, the day Imam Hussain,
OL,18,Fthe grandson of the Prophet Muhammed,
OL,19,Fand his family were martyred in what
OL,20,Fis now the city of Karbala, Iraq.
