OL,6,FUS President Donald Trump says he will
OL,7,Fincrease tariffs on EU goods to 50%
OL,8,Ffrom next month and he has threatened
OL,9,FApple with 25% tariffs on iPhones made
OL,10,Foutside the United States.
OL,12,FIn a post on his Truth Social platform
OL,13,Fon Friday, Trump said the European
OL,14,FUnion had "very difficult to deal
OL,15,Fwith" and that discussions with the
OL,16,Fbloc were proving unproductive.
OL,18,F"Therefore, I am recommending a
OL,19,Fstraight 50% Tariff on the European
OL,20,FUnion, starting on June 1, 2025," he
OL,21,Fwrote.
