OL,4,Cengulfed in umpiring controversy
OL,6,FThe British number one and rising
OL,7,Ftennis star Jack Draper was involved
OL,8,Fin a wildly controversial conclusion
OL,9,Fto his match last night in Cincinnati.
OL,11,FThe incident took place in the final
OL,12,Fseconds of his match against the
OL,13,FCanadian player Felix Auger-Aliassime.
OL,15,FIt was match point for the Brit when
OL,16,Fhe played an awkward volley that
OL,17,Fsomehow ended up over the net. The
OL,18,Fumpire called the match for Draper.

OL,6,FBut to Auger-Aliassime - and to many
OL,7,Fin the crowd - it was clear it had
OL,8,Fcome off Draper's frame and bounced on
OL,9,Fhis side of the net.
OL,11,FReplays clearly showed it was a double
OL,12,Fbounce. Draper told the umpire he
OL,13,Fwasn't sure what had happened, but
OL,14,Fother tennis stars took to social
OL,15,Fmedia to ridicule the umpiring
OL,16,Fdecision.

OL,6,FDraper will face some criticism in the
