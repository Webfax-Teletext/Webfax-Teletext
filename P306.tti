OL,9,Faccording to a Supreme Court ruling.
OL,11,FThe Swedish company has been in a

OL,13,Fassocation for the UK dairy industry,
OL,14,FDairy UK, over the validity of its
OL,15,Ftrademark phrase "Post Milk
OL,16,FGeneration".
OL,18,FOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled
OL,19,Fthe plant-based drink maker can no
OL,20,Flonger use the saying, as "milk" does
OL,21,Fnot accurately describe its products.

OL,12,FDairy UK lawyers said the phrase
