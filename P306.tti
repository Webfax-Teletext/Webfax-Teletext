OL,6,FParent company of Facebook and

OL,8,Frestrict graphic and politically
OL,9,Fcharged posts and the type of image
OL,10,Fshared may have in fact boosted the

OL,6,FHowever the image has also faced
OL,7,Fcriticism from some who argue that it

OL,9,Fviolence occurring in Gaza, suggesting
OL,10,Fthat it is a 'sanitised' depiction,
OL,11,Fwhich makes it easier for people to

OL,14,FOthers argue the AI-generated nature
