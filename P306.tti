OL,9,FSickle cell is the name for a group of
OL,10,Finherited health conditions that
OL,11,Faffect the red blood cells.
OL,13,FRed blood cells are usually disc-
OL,14,Fshaped with a concave centre, allowing

OL,16,Fto be absorbed by the haemoglobin in

OL,7,FWith sickle cell disease, the red
OL,8,Fblood cells become misshapen, often in
OL,9,Fa sickle or crescent shape. This means
OL,10,Fthere's less surface area for oxygen
OL,11,Fto be absorbed.
OL,13,FThey also die much quicker and block
OL,14,Fblood vessels, leading to symptoms
OL,15,Fthat are often very painful.
OL,17,FThe most serious type is called sickle
OL,18,Fcell anaemia, where red blood cells
OL,19,Fcannot carry enough oxygen around the
OL,20,Fbody, which can cause tiredness and
OL,21,Fshortness of breath.
