OL,6,FSo how can you tell if a photograph
OL,7,Fhas been edited? ITV News explains.
OL,9,FScrutinise the picture
OL,11,FLorena Martinez, head of editorial
OL,12,Foperations in Europe from
OL,13,Fdisinformation tackling company
OL,14,FLogically Facts told ITV News how to
OL,15,Fspot an edited photo, from the basics
OL,16,Fto a full-on deep dive investigation.
OL,18,FThe first thing to do, according to Ms
OL,19,FMartinez, is to scrutinise the main
OL,20,Felements in the picture and look for
OL,21,Fanything that doesn't look quite right.

OL,6,F"Zoom in using the magnifying glass

OL,8,FMartinez said.
OL,10,FIf anything is pixelated or blurry,
OL,11,Fthat can be a sign of something being
OL,12,Fawry.
OL,14,FThe main part of the photo of the

OL,6,FSome social media users for example
OL,7,Fstarted to look at the tree in

OL,15,F"The background is something that
