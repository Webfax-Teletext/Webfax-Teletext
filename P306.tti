OL,11,FOne of his biggest tasks will be

OL,13,Ffund the new collider at CERN at a
OL,14,Fcost of #13 billion.
OL,16,F"This is spread over 15 years not a

OL,18,Fbetween 24 member states of CERN and
OL,19,Fother international partners,"

OL,6,F"To convince the government there are
OL,7,Fmany arguments. One is the science,
OL,8,Fand you have to base why you're doing
OL,9,Fit on the science. Then there is the
OL,10,Fwider economic impact of working right

OL,15,FThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is
OL,16,Fcurrently in shutdown for maintenance
OL,17,Fand the High Luminosity upgrade.
OL,19,FThis will increase the brightness of
