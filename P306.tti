OL,7,FThe Princess of Wales has called for
OL,8,Fthe "stigma" faced by those with
OL,9,Faddictions to end and society to show
OL,10,F"compassion and love" to those
OL,11,Fdependent on drugs, alcohol or
OL,12,Fgambling.
OL,14,FKate said society's experience of
OL,15,Faddiction was "shaped by fear, shame
OL,16,Fand judgement" and urged people to
OL,17,Fhave open conversations and bring the
OL,18,Fissue "out of the shadows," in a
OL,19,Fmessage to mark Addiction Awareness
OL,20,FWeek, which runs from November 23 to
