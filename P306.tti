OL,8,Fan attempted return to Westminster is
OL,9,Fworth the risk, the cost, and the

OL,12,FThe seat sits in Burnham's political

OL,13,FAlthough Burnham has not made his

OL,17,FLabour's all-powerful National

OL,10,FI've heard from multiple members of

OL,6,FIt would be a bold move from Sir Keir
OL,7,FStarmer and his leadership team, but
OL,8,Fas one Burnham-supporting MP told me:
OL,9,F"If they intentionally block such a

OL,11,Fwhen we are struggling in the polls

OL,17,Fresign as the mayor of Greater
