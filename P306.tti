OL,3,CRob Burrow: What is motor neurone

OL,6,FIt is a life-shortening neurological
OL,7,Fdisease which affects the nerves that
OL,8,Fcontrol movement, so muscles no longer
OL,9,Fwork, according to the MND Association.
OL,11,FThe charity says these nerves ` motor
OL,12,Fneurones ` control muscle activity
OL,13,Fsuch as walking, speaking and
OL,14,Fswallowing.
OL,16,FBut as they are attacked, the brain's
OL,17,Fmessages gradually stop reaching
OL,18,Fmuscles, leading to weakness and
OL,19,Fwasting, followed by breathing
OL,20,Fdifficulties.
