OL,4,C13-year-old with rare blood disorder
OL,6,FThe family of a teenage girl who was
OL,7,Fdiagnosed with an extremely rare blood
OL,8,Fdisorder just days after turning 13
OL,9,Fhave issued an urgent plea for a stem
OL,10,Fcell donor to save her life.
OL,12,FMillie Fairley, from Eastbourne, East
OL,13,FSussex, has aplastic anaemia, which
OL,14,Faffects around two people in every
OL,15,Fmillion in the UK.
OL,17,FThe condition means the bone marrow
OL,18,Fcannot make enough new blood cells for
OL,19,Fthe body to work normally, making it
OL,20,Fharder to fight infection, stop
OL,21,Fbleeding or carry oxygen.

OL,12,F"My little girl should be starting

OL,17,F"She can't see her friends, and it's
