OL,6,FThe equalities watchdog is looking to
OL,7,Fupdate its guidance for service
OL,8,Fproviders and public bodies by "this
OL,9,Fsummer" after the Supreme Court ruled
OL,10,Fthat a woman is defined in law by
OL,11,F"biological sex".
OL,13,FThe ruling on Wednesday said that the
OL,14,Fterms woman and sex in the 2010
OL,15,FEquality Act "refer to a biological
OL,16,Fwoman and biological sex", meaning
OL,17,Ftransgender women with a gender
OL,18,Frecognition certificate (GRC) can be
OL,19,Fexcluded from single-sex spaces if
OL,20,F"proportionate", the Supreme Court
