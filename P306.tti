OL,3,CWhat's behind the Budget tradition of

OL,6,FThe word Budget originates from the
OL,7,Fold French word for little bag,
OL,8,F"bougette". The Budget statement has
OL,9,Fhistorically been brought to the
OL,10,FCommons in a leather bag, which has
OL,11,Fsince been replaced by the red box.
OL,13,FThe same wooden box, covered with
OL,14,Fscarlet leather and lined with black
OL,15,Fsatin, was hand-crafted in the 1860s
OL,16,Fand used for about 100 consecutive
OL,17,Fyears.

OL,6,FLord Callaghan broke with tradition in
OL,7,F1965 when he used a new box. Gordon
OL,8,FBrown later became the second
OL,9,Fchancellor to use a new box for the
OL,10,FBudget in 1997. A new red box was then
OL,11,Fused again by George Osbourne in 2011.
OL,13,FIs the red box only used for the
OL,14,FBudget?
OL,16,FRed boxes, also known as despatch
OL,17,Fboxes, are used on a daily basis by
OL,18,Fministers to transport official
OL,19,Fgovernment papers.
