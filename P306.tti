OL,7,FZelenskyy said three relevant things:
OL,9,F1) Sorry, President Trump.
OL,11,F2) You are the boss, President Trump.
OL,13,F3) I'll sign the transfer of precious
OL,14,Fmineral rights to you, without a prior
OL,15,Fcommitment from you to guarantee our
OL,16,Fsecurity (though I'd still like to
OL,17,Fhave that guarantee, if peace is to be
