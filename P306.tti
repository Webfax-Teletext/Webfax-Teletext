OL,7,Fhe was part of a peace summit with his
OL,8,FPalestinian counterpart Yasser Arafat,
OL,9,Fheld by Bill Clinton in the summer of

OL,14,Fcurrent US president, Donald Trump,
OL,15,Fwho has made peace in the region a key
OL,16,Fpart of his foreign policy legacy.
OL,18,FMr Barak told ITV News: "Yesterday was

OL,20,Flast two years and probably of the
OL,21,FJewish people in the last two years.
