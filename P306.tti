OL,7,FHis comments came in a week that saw
OL,8,Fviolent clashes between rioters and
OL,9,Fgardai at the former Crown Paints
OL,10,Ffactory in Coolock in north Dublin ` a
OL,11,Fsite proposed to be converted into an
OL,12,Faccommodation facility.
OL,14,FMr Harris said the attacks on gardai
OL,15,Fwere not caused by concerns over a
OL,16,Flack of community engagement. He
OL,17,Finsisted it was instead "thuggery and
OL,18,Flawlessness" perpetrated by people who
OL,19,F"will exploit any divisive situation".

OL,11,FWhile the Taoiseach insisted the issue
