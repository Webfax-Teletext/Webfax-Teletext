OL,9,Fitems on Monday evening when his van
OL,10,Fgot caught in the deadly floods in

OL,12,Fmore than 200 lives.
OL,14,FMr Wass realised something was wrong
OL,15,Fwhen his phone's emergency alert went

OL,13,Fon roads, working or covered in water
OL,14,Fin low-lying areas or garages, which
OL,15,Fbecame death traps.
OL,17,FMr Wass said: "The problem was we

OL,19,Fferry and been warned this was coming,
OL,20,Fwe would've stayed where we were."
