OL,6,FDonald Trump has previously described
OL,7,Fclimate change as a hoax and judging
OL,8,Fby his initial actions, he's doubling
OL,9,Fdown on his beliefs.
OL,11,FOne of his first pledges after taking
OL,12,Foffice was to "drill baby drill" for
OL,13,Fmore oil and gas.
OL,15,FHe has already started the year-long
OL,16,Fprocess of withdrawing from the
OL,17,FInternational Paris Climate Agreement
OL,18,Fwhich aims to keep warming below 1.5
OL,19,Fdegrees.
