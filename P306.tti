OL,4,C'offensive racial stereotype'
OL,6,FA TV advert for Sanex shower gel has
OL,7,Fbeen banned over an "offensive racial
OL,8,Fstereotype", the advertising watchdog
OL,9,Fhas said.
OL,11,FThe advert, which aired in June,
OL,12,Fshowed a black woman with red scratch
OL,13,Fmarks and covered in clay-like
OL,14,Fmaterial before cutting to a scene of
OL,15,Fa white woman showering.
OL,17,FThe Advertising Standards Authority
OL,18,F(ASA) has ruled the advert must not
OL,19,Fappear again, finding viewers could
OL,20,Finterpret it as suggesting that "white
OL,21,Fskin was superior to black skin".

OL,6,FThe watchdog received two complaints
OL,7,Fabout the content.
OL,9,F"The ad was therefore structured in
OL,10,Fsuch a way that it was the black skin,
OL,11,Fdepicted in association with itchy and
OL,12,Fdry skin, which was shown to be
OL,13,Fproblematic and uncomfortable, whereas
OL,14,Fthe white skin, depicted as smoother
OL,15,Fand clean after using the product, was
OL,16,Fshown successfully changed and
OL,17,Fresolved," the watchdog said.

OL,17,FIt said the depiction of diverse
