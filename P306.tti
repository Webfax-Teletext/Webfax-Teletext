OL,6,FPresident Donald Trump has repeated
OL,7,Fcalls for Canada to become the 51st
OL,8,Fstate, stating that the country would
OL,9,Fbe "better off."
OL,11,FIn an interview with Fox News that
OL,12,Faired ahead of the Super Bowl on
OL,13,FSunday, Trump said: "I think Canada
OL,14,Fwould be much better off being the
OL,15,F51st state because we lose $200
OL,16,Fbillion a year with Canada. And I'm
OL,17,Fnot going to let that happen," he said.
OL,19,F"Why are we paying $200 billion a
OL,20,Fyear, essentially a subsidy to Canada?"

OL,6,FCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
OL,7,Fsaid on Friday that Trump's talk of
OL,8,Fmaking Canada the 51st US state is "a
OL,9,Freal thing" and is linked to his
OL,10,Fdesire for access to the country's
OL,11,Fnatural resources.
OL,13,F"Mr Trump has it in mind that the

OL,16,Fconversations with him on," Trudeau
OL,17,Fsaid, according to CBC, Canada's
