OL,6,FThe "chronic" under-performance of
OL,7,Fboys at GCSE should be treated as a
OL,8,F"major issue", it has been suggested.
OL,10,FProfessor Alan Smithers, director of
OL,11,Fthe Centre for Education and
OL,12,FEmployment Research at the University
OL,13,Fof Buckingham, said the talents of
OL,14,Fboys are not being developed as
OL,15,F"fully" as they could be, which could
OL,16,Flead to a "decline in the nation's
OL,17,Feconomic competitiveness".
OL,19,FThe education expert predicted "girls
OL,20,Fwill continue to be ahead" of boys at
OL,21,FGCSE level.
