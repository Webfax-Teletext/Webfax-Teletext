OL,6,FAt least our coasts will offer some
OL,7,Frespite from the heat.

OL,6,FWill this heat last?
OL,8,FThe current heatwave is likely to end

OL,11,FSunday will gradually start to turn a

OL,14,Fthe risk of some showers and
OL,15,Fthunderstorms in places.
OL,17,FThis breakdown continues into Tuesday.
OL,18,FSo as we head into next week we will
OL,19,Fsee a change. A signal for something
OL,20,Fless hot and turning unsettled from
OL,21,Fthe west.
