OL,6,FOur sunny March was very welcome after

OL,9,FBut the endless blue skies and
OL,10,Fsunshine of last month - paired with
OL,11,Fchilly nights - has reminded many of
OL,12,Fthe weather conditions we experienced
OL,13,Fin spring 2020 and 2021 - a poignant
OL,14,Ftime where the pandemic and lockdown
OL,15,Fcoincided with one of the sunniest
OL,16,Fsprings on record.
OL,18,FWe've seen well above average sunshine
OL,19,Fhours for the month - and for England
OL,20,Fit was the sunniest March on record.

OL,6,FIt's also been exceptionally dry, with

OL,11,FWhy is our current weather similar to

OL,14,FApril 2021 was the sunniest on record,

OL,3,CLockdown weather returns: Why this
OL,4,Cspring feels similar to March 2020
OL,6,FWhy? We've been dominated by high
OL,7,Fpressure through most of spring so far
OL,8,F- similar to 2020. It's known as a
OL,9,F'blocking pattern', when high pressure
OL,10,Fstays in control and low pressure or
OL,11,Ffrontal systems - associated with
OL,12,Fcloud and rain - are kept at bay.
OL,14,FAs the high pressure builds and
OL,15,Fstrengthens, it acts as a sort of a
OL,16,F'forcefield' - meaning it becomes
OL,17,Fharder to break-down by other less
OL,18,Ffavourable weather systems.

OL,6,FEssentially we have a very similar

OL,12,FA huge difference in temperatures by
