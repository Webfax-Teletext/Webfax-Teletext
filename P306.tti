OL,6,FThe 31-year-old DHL aircraft, operated
OL,7,Fby Swiftair, a Madrid-based
OL,8,Fcontractor, is considered by experts
OL,9,Fto be an older airframe, though that's
OL,10,Fnot unusual for cargo flights.
OL,12,FAccording to CNN, DHL Group said the
OL,13,Fplane "made a forced landing about one
OL,14,Fkilometer from VNO Airport." It
OL,15,Fconfirmed four people were onboard and
