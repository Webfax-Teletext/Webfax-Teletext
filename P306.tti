OL,6,FThe Met Office has said there is a
OL,7,Fchance of 'thundersnow' in the
OL,8,Fforecast as this week's deep freeze
OL,9,Fcontinues.
OL,11,FTonight we are likely to have our
OL,12,Fcoldest night of the season so far,
OL,13,Fwith minus double figures through
OL,14,Frural spots of Scotland where there's
OL,15,Flying snow.
OL,17,FThere's been notable snowfall across
OL,18,Fparts of Scotland and north-eastern
OL,19,FEngland this week.

OL,15,Fwhere the air is cold enough for snow

OL,6,FAlready, lightning has been reported
OL,7,Foff the coast of Scotland and north-
OL,8,Feastern England - and while the heavy
OL,9,Fsnow is falling, it'll seem unusual
OL,10,Fand dramatic.
OL,12,FThunder can sound different with snow
OL,13,F- the larger surface area of
OL,14,Fsnowflakes helps reverberate and
OL,15,Faffects the acoustics, making the
OL,16,Fthunder sound more muffled.
OL,18,FWith longer hours of dark sky and
OL,19,Fshort daylight this time of year, the
OL,20,Fchances of seeing lightning with
OL,21,Fsnowfall can be higher.

OL,6,FIs thundersnow unusual?
OL,8,FThundersnow, as well as sounding like
OL,9,Fa superhero, is rare in the UK, but
OL,10,FScotland is not a stranger to it.
OL,12,FThe chances are higher this week due
OL,13,Fto the stark contrasts of cold Arctic

OL,6,FThe brisk and biting north wind has
OL,7,Fnot only meant a wind chill but has
OL,8,Falso generated frequent showers of
OL,9,Fsleet and snow in these areas, all
OL,10,Ffeeding in from the moisture of the
OL,11,FNorth Sea.
OL,13,FThis process, along with bitter arctic
OL,14,Fair, has meant heavy snow and blowing
OL,15,Fsnow, more so over higher routes,
OL,16,Fgiving challenging conditions.
OL,18,FThe combination of this process - the
OL,19,Fatmospheric set-up, the wind direction
OL,20,Fand geography of these areas brings a
OL,21,Fhigh risk of snow.
