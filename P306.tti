OL,6,FThere are some staple moments of that
OL,7,Fsimply never change.
OL,9,FFrom the debate of when Ramadan
OL,10,Fstarts, to being asked a thousand
OL,11,Ftimes "not even water?" when telling
OL,12,Fnon-Muslims you are going without food
OL,13,Fand drink during sunlight hours for an
OL,14,Fentire month.
OL,16,FThe truth is, these instances are all
OL,17,Fpart of a shared experience in this
OL,18,Fvery special month, one that ties the
OL,19,Ffour million Muslims in the UK
OL,20,Ftogether.

OL,9,Fthrough this month, while in London's

OL,11,Fturned on, a moment which Aisha Desai,
OL,12,Fthe founder of the project, said gave

OL,15,FThat has been a recurring theme
