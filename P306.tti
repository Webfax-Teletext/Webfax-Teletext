OL,8,FUniversity College London's
OL,9,FBehavioural Science & Health, said:
OL,10,F"Food fussiness is common among
OL,11,Fchildren and can be a major source of
OL,12,Fanxiety for parents and caregivers,
OL,13,Fwho often blame themselves for this
OL,14,Fbehaviour or are blamed by others.
OL,16,F"We hope our finding that fussy eating
OL,17,Fis largely innate may help to
OL,18,Falleviate parental blame.
OL,20,F"This behaviour is not a result of
OL,21,Fparenting.

OL,7,FQuestionnaires were used to assess
OL,8,Ffood fussiness when the children were
OL,9,F16 months old, with follow-ups at ages
OL,10,Fthree, five, seven and 13 years old.
OL,12,FThe team found that picky eating
OL,13,Fpeaked around the age of seven and
OL,14,Fdeclined slightly after that.
OL,16,FThey said that genetic influence on

OL,18,Fafter toddlerhood, from 60% at 16
