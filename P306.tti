OL,7,FIn his new year message, Mr Bradshaw
OL,8,Fsaid Labour's first budget, which
OL,9,Fbrought in the proposed changes, had
OL,10,Fcapped a "wretched year" for farming,
OL,11,Fwhich had suffered volatile costs, one
OL,12,Fof the wettest periods in decades and
OL,13,Fa reduction in subsidies.
OL,15,FHe described the inheritance tax
OL,16,Fchanges as an "indefensible family
OL,17,Ffarm tax", although the Government has
OL,18,Frepeatedly defended the move, saying
OL,19,Fthe vast majority of farmers will not
OL,20,Fhave to pay it.
