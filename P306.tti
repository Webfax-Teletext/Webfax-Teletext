OL,6,FThe biscuits are not just a British
OL,7,Ffavourite as they are now enjoyed in
OL,8,Faround 50 countries. Nearly 10 million
OL,9,Fpackets are exported from the UK each
OL,10,Fyear, with Australia being the biggest
OL,11,Fmarket.
OL,13,FThe digestive name may not be the most

OL,16,Fproperties due to its use of baking
OL,17,Fsoda in its original recipe.
