OL,6,FThis clearly would mean keeping a

OL,10,FStudio presentation and production can

OL,14,FRealistically, if any dedicated output

OL,11,FAll the news programmes in the nations

OL,7,Fon a commercial broadcaster to do
OL,8,Fsomething which the BBC has never done?
OL,10,FThis is not 1961 or even 1993.
OL,12,FOr does the simple fact that ratings

OL,16,FThe actual boundary between STV's two
