OL,6,GThis week marks a very special
OL,7,Gbirthday for a very special magazine.
OL,8,GThe 100th birthday of Radio Times is
OL,9,Gan occasion to celebrate.
OL,11,FRT today is a premium product ` and
OL,12,Fpriced accordingly. It is the only TV
OL,13,Flistings magazine aimed at selective
OL,14,Fviewers and the only one which
OL,15,Fregularly covers serious programmes
OL,16,Fand issues about broadcasting itself.
OL,18,FBut during its years as the BBC's own
OL,19,Flistings magazine, it's character
OL,20,Fclosely reflected that of BBC TV and
OL,21,Fradio.

OL,12,FAs late as 1988, children's

OL,18,Fstood in stark contrast to that of TV
OL,19,FTimes ` always more of a woman's
OL,20,Fmagazine than a TV guide and, in the
OL,21,Flate-80s, notably vulgar and badly
OL,22,Fdesigned too.

OL,6,FBut of course RT in the old days had
OL,7,Flinks to Presentation and even
OL,8,Foccasionally covered Pres.
OL,10,FThe "adverts" for the magazine up
OL,11,Funtil around 1990 were made by the
OL,12,FBBC Promotions team within Pres and
OL,13,Fwere often more like trailers for the
OL,14,Fprogrammes themselves.
OL,16,FPres fans of a certain vintage
OL,17,Fremember the programme menu advising
OL,18,Fthere were "full details in Radio
OL,19,FTimes" and announcers describing late

OL,6,FProgramme slides sometimes featured

OL,11,FSometimes the pages of RT even tell

OL,15,Foverhauled, RT introduced the new
