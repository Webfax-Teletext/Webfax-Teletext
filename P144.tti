OL,6,FThe BBC says it will reinvest some
OL,7,Fmoney into online services, such as
OL,8,Flive blogs and streaming via the
OL,9,FiPlayer. In addition to helping the
OL,10,FBBC save #500 million, BBC News says
OL,11,Fit is responding to a fall in linear
OL,12,Faudiences, which it says has fallen
OL,13,F11% in the last five years.
OL,15,FHowever, it's known that news
OL,16,Faudiences actually rose in 2020 and
OL,17,F2021 due to the pandemic, so the drop
OL,18,Fquoted may be exaggerated by events

OL,15,FA fall in audiences can thus be used

OL,17,Fblogs are relatively cheap, compared

OL,6,FThat a shift online does not

OL,12,Fonline-only service, although in the
OL,13,FUK NBC News Now does also have
OL,14,Fconventional broadcast outlets.
OL,16,FThe live nature of the news means
OL,17,Fviewers do want to dip in and out of
