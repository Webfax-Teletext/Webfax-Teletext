OL,5,GIt was the TV event of the week. The
OL,6,GITV 1 drama Mr Bates vs The Post
OL,7,GOffice got some of the highest ratings
OL,8,Gof the week.
OL,10,FBut it also made a far deeper impact.
OL,12,FThe story of the Horizon scandal was
OL,13,Frevisited by many newspapers and
OL,14,Fbecame a national talking point.
OL,16,FMore than 700 sub-postmasters were

OL,18,Ftheft and fraud. It was actuality
OL,19,Fcaused by faulty software.

OL,10,FYet again, the power of mainstream

OL,14,FIt is hard to imagine a programme on
