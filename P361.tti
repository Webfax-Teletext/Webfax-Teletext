OL,6,FThe hosepipe ban across Yorkshire has
OL,7,Fbeen lifted after a rise in reservoir
OL,8,Flevels across the region.
OL,10,FYorkshire Water imposed restrictions
OL,11,Fin July after the driest spring in 132
OL,12,Fyears and a record-breaking warm
OL,13,Fsummer meant 22 reservoirs dropped
OL,14,Fbelow 20%.
OL,16,FBut the company said levels are now at
OL,17,F91.6% and Hull aquifer levels are at
OL,18,F77%, above the average for the time of
OL,19,Fyear, meaning they can safely lift the
OL,20,Frules.
