OL,12,F"an amazing project to be part of".
OL,14,FShe said: "I loved growing up with

OL,16,Factually, for one, be a rugby player
OL,17,Fand then a Gladiator, and now an

OL,11,FShe also reflected on the lack of deaf

OL,13,F"I have so many people who I looked up

OL,17,F"I really was inspired by them, but I
OL,18,Fdidn't really know anyone who was deaf

OL,20,Fbecause I competed in the Deaf
