OL,9,FA 37-year-old man was arrested on
OL,10,Fsuspicion of criminal damage after the

OL,12,Ffelled. He's been bailed pending
OL,13,Ffurther enquiries.
OL,15,FThe tree had stood outside for 30

OL,17,Fa symbol of the site's growth.
OL,19,FHowever, the hospice says ten more
OL,20,Ftrees on their grounds appear to have
OL,21,Fbeen poisoned in another attack.

OL,10,F"The felling of one of our beloved

OL,12,Fanger across our community, and this
