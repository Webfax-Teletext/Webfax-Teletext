OL,3,CWhy did rioting break out in Leeds?
OL,5,FAs the sun rose in Harehills on Friday
OL,6,Fmorning, it did so on scenes of
OL,7,Fdestruction which told the story of a
OL,8,Fnight of uncontrolled violence.
OL,10,FThe burnt-out shell of a double decker
OL,11,Fbus, scorch marks in the road, melted
OL,12,Ftraffic bollards.
OL,14,FHours earlier, social workers had been
OL,15,Fsent to a house in Luxor Street. There
OL,16,Fwas little indication at that stage of
OL,17,Fthe shocking outbreak of disorder
OL,18,Fwhich would follow.
