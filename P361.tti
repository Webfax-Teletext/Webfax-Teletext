OL,6,FWhen Harvey Willgoose's killer was
OL,7,Farrested on school premises in
OL,8,FFebruary it was far from the first
OL,9,Ftime he had come to the attention of
OL,10,Fpolice.
OL,12,FMohammed Umar Khan, who was 15 when he
OL,13,Fstabbed Harvey to death at All Saints
OL,14,FCatholic High School, had experienced
OL,15,Fa troubled upbringing.
OL,17,FA fascination with weapons emerged
OL,18,Fduring the murder trial.
OL,20,FBut he had been involved with police
OL,21,Fbefore.

OL,6,FIn December 2024 - a matter of weeks
OL,7,Fbefore the murder - Khan was spoken to
OL,8,Fby an officer after his own mother
OL,9,Freported him when she found an axe in
OL,10,Fhis school bag.
OL,12,FThe weapon was confiscated and Khan
OL,13,Fwas given what police call "safety

OL,15,Ftaken.
OL,17,FDet Ch Insp Andy Knowles, the chief
OL,18,Finvestigator for South Yorkshire
OL,19,FPolice, said the law meant he could
OL,20,Fnot be arrested.
