OL,6,FChemical producer Ineos is cutting a

OL,10,Fwould be cut at the Ineos Acetyls
OL,11,Fsite, which makes petrochemical
OL,12,Fproducts such as acetic acid. He said
OL,13,Fmore roles across the industry would

OL,17,FThe firm said "carbon-heavy" imports
OL,18,Ffrom China are "flooding the market"
OL,19,Fafter they were blocked from entering
OL,20,Fthe US due to recent tariffs.
