OL,8,Fanger among the community.
OL,10,FAn intruder broke into the grounds of
OL,11,FHospice earlier this month and felled
OL,12,Fthe tree. The hospice said the tree
OL,13,Fhad stood outside for 30 years and had
OL,14,Fbeen a symbol of the site's growth.
OL,16,FAn inspection found that around 50
OL,17,FEcoplug tree stump killers had been
OL,18,Finserted into ten trees - all of which
OL,19,Fwere up to 100 years old and located
OL,20,Fnear the felled tree.
