OL,8,Fcreates a mosaic of habitats and this
OL,9,Fallows more species to thrive.
OL,11,FWhen beavers fell trees to build dams,
OL,12,Fthey don't kill them, so the trees

OL,15,FCoun Elliot said: "Securing the

OL,17,Fin Sheffield is really exciting. I
OL,18,Fwent to visit a project in North
