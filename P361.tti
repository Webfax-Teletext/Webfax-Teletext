OL,7,Fwhich runs two refuges in says the
OL,8,Fgovernment must provide more long-term

OL,12,FThe warning comes amid fears some
OL,13,Fservices are at risk of closing
OL,14,Fbecause of a council funding crisis,
OL,15,Fafter the Domestic Abuse Commissioner
OL,16,Fsaid many were "hanging by a thread".

OL,13,FAlthough councils have a statutory
