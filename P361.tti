OL,6,FBut Uneekhomes appealed to the
OL,7,FPlanning Inspectorate, arguing that
OL,8,Fthe banners were necessary to protect
OL,9,Fthe building, which dates back to
OL,10,F1912, from vandals.
OL,12,FIn its appeal the company said: "These
OL,13,Fbanners serve as temporary protection
OL,14,Funtil we can locate an affordable
OL,15,Fsupplier to replace the current
OL,16,Fwindows with identical ones.
OL,18,F"However, finding a supplier offering
OL,19,Flead windows at a reasonable cost has
OL,20,Fproven challenging, as the price is
OL,21,Fcurrently prohibitively high."
