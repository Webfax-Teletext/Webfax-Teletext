OL,6,FThroughout this period, the UK will
OL,7,Fsee a battle between Atlantic weather
OL,8,Fsystems attempting to arrive from the
OL,9,Fwest while high pressure and colder
OL,10,Fconditions attempt to exert some
OL,11,Finfluence from the east. Initially,
OL,12,Fmilder Atlantic air is expected to
OL,13,Fdominate. This should maintain often
OL,14,Fcloudy, changeable conditions with
OL,15,Fshowers or longer spells of rain for
OL,16,Fmost. The wettest weather in western
OL,17,Fparts of the country, drier in the
OL,18,Feast. Temperatures overall likely to
OL,19,Fbe around average with some night
OL,20,Ffrosts in clearer areas. Later in the
OL,21,Fperiod, there is an increased chance
OL,22,Fthat conditions will turn colder. This

OL,5,CFriday 30 Jan - Friday 13 Feb
OL,6,FInitially, slowly evolving weather
OL,7,Fpatterns are most likely in the
OL,8,Fvicinity of the UK, with low pressure
OL,9,Ftypically to the west or southwest and
OL,10,Fhigh pressure to the northeast. This
