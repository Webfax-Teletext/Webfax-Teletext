OL,13,Fbut will continue to bring broadly
OL,14,Funsettled weather to many areas, with
OL,15,Ffurther spells of rain and perhaps

OL,5,COutlook for Tue 24 Feb to Tue 10 Mar
OL,6,FBroadly changeable conditions are
OL,7,Fexpected across the UK during this

OL,9,Fprobably dominate, meaning showers or
OL,10,Flonger spells of rain, heavy at times,
OL,11,Ffor much of the UK, and still the

OL,13,FSome drier interludes are likely,
OL,14,Fthough it must be said, flooding
OL,15,Fimpacts remain possible given recent
OL,16,Fvery wet weather. Windy conditions
OL,17,Flook probable from time to time.
OL,18,FTemperatures probably close to or a
