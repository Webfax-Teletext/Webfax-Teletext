OL,6,FShowers or longer spells of rain, as
OL,7,Fwell as occasional strong winds, are
OL,8,Fmost likely at first as Atlantic low
OL,9,Fpressure systems dominate in the

OL,14,Fvarying from around, or a little

OL,16,Fto cold at times, mainly in the north.
OL,17,FAlthough unsettled weather is likely

OL,19,Fsome drier interludes between weather
OL,20,Fsystems. These drier interludes will
OL,21,Fbecome increasingly likely and perhaps
