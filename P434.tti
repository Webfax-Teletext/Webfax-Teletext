OL,6,F"Car crash failures" led to the
OL,7,Ffelling of 40 palm trees at a historic
OL,8,Fseafront garden in Devon, a report has
OL,9,Ffound.
OL,11,FThe report concluded that issues with
OL,12,F"control and communication" led to a
OL,13,F"debacle" around the felling of the
OL,14,Ftrees on Torquay seafront.
OL,16,FThere was a national outcry in

OL,6,FThe palms stood in the Italian

OL,10,Fin 1924.

OL,15,FAt the time, Torbay Council said they
