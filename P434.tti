OL,6,F"I like making them happy and seeing
OL,7,Fthem smile. And at the end, when I do
OL,8,Fmy show, they come over to me and they
OL,9,Fsay 'you make my day'. And I really
OL,10,Flike that as well.
OL,12,F"Because normally children go out to
OL,13,Fthe park and play football, go to the
OL,14,Fzoo. But all I like to do is sing and
OL,15,Fmake people happy."
OL,17,FLucciano's performances have been
OL,18,Fappreciated by many of the residents.
