OL,6,FAllison Talling, a resident of

OL,8,Fthe defibrillator as "massive".
OL,10,FThe decision of the community to
OL,11,Fobtain a defibrillator was influenced
OL,12,Fby a stroke her father Tony had in
OL,13,F2016.
OL,15,FAlison said: "He had to wait 45

OL,17,Fhome that night and thought we need to
