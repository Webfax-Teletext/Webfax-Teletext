OL,6,FMs Phillips said staff are working
OL,7,Faround the clock to rear the fox cubs,
OL,8,Fso they can eventually be released
OL,9,Fback into the wild.
OL,11,FShe said rearing the cubs is a complex
OL,12,Fprocess, as too much exposure to
OL,13,Fhumans will mean they are tame when
OL,14,Fthey are released.
OL,16,F"We want to keep the association with
