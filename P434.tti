OL,16,FThe BDMLR team said the net was

OL,7,FA spokesperson for the team added:
OL,8,F"This made disentangling her far more
OL,9,Fdifficult as the knots of the net
OL,10,Fcould not be pulled through cleanly."
OL,12,FThe team in Cornwall and colleagues at
OL,13,Fthe Seal Research Trust have been
OL,14,Flooking out for Nanette to try to cut
OL,15,Fher free since she was sighted in
OL,16,FDecember 2024.
OL,18,FThey made two attempts to rescue the
OL,19,Fseal which failed due to "disturbance
OL,20,Ffrom people on the clifftop ignoring
OL,21,Fbarriers" which scared off the seals.

OL,7,FTheir third attempt, on 31 January,
OL,8,Ffinally proved successful. Five
OL,9,Frescuers and a vet used a cargo net
OL,10,Fand a specialist stretcher to catch
OL,11,FNanette and keep her still, allowing
OL,12,Fthem to cut the net out of her neck.
OL,14,FAs the cut was so complex, the team
OL,15,Fhad to figure out a system of cutting
OL,16,Fknots in a specific order to "release
OL,17,Fthe strands, which could then be

OL,19,Fso that she could be released again".
