OL,7,FA Somerset MP is accusing Labour of
OL,8,Fjust not understanding, as she warns
OL,9,Fthat upcoming changes to inheritance
OL,10,Ftax could "devastate" her family's
OL,11,Ffarm in Somerset - calling it "the
OL,12,Ffinal straw" for rural businesses.
OL,14,FSarah Dyke, a Liberal Democrat, has
OL,15,Ftold ITV West Country that "anxiety is
OL,16,Fthrough the roof" as farmers prepare
OL,17,Ffor next year when agricultural assets
OL,18,Fworth more than #1m will be subject to
OL,19,Fpay tax at 20%.
