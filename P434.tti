OL,6,FThe South West's youngest newly
OL,7,Felected MP spent eight years working
OL,8,Fpart-time in a Weymouth fish and chip
OL,9,Fshop, but from a young age his taste
OL,10,Fwas clearly for politics.
OL,12,FIn 2013, before he could even vote, a
OL,13,Fteenage Lloyd Hatton wrote to his
OL,14,Flocal MP, Conservative Richard Drax,
OL,15,Fin support of the legalisation of same
OL,16,Fsex marriage.
OL,18,FDrax, now Hatton's predecessor,
OL,19,Fconsistently voted against allowing

OL,12,FIt's a moment Hatton credits as one of
