OL,6,FIt is hoped the site will be a haven
OL,7,Ffor wildlife, a nature reserve for the
OL,8,Fcommunity and a hub for research
OL,9,Fstudying how saltmarshes store carbon,

OL,13,FThe trust's deputy chief executive
OL,14,FKevin Peberdy said the site would
OL,15,Fserve as a local nature reserve but
OL,16,Fthe charity wants to keep the area
OL,17,Fquiet.
OL,19,F"If inevitably people want to go and
OL,20,Fsee it, we'll make provision for that,
OL,21,Fmaybe a small car park," he said.
