OL,7,Fconfirmed it will formally review its

OL,10,FSomerset Council declared a major
OL,11,Fincident almost three weeks ago, after
OL,12,Fdozens of homes flooded and several
OL,13,Fkey routes became impassable following

OL,17,FWednesday, flooding minister Emma

OL,6,FHardy said: "The review will consider
OL,7,Fseveral important questions: when
OL,8,Fpumps should be activated, whether the
OL,9,Fcurrent trigger points are right, and
OL,10,Fwhether installing permanent pumps in
OL,11,Fcertain locations could offer better

OL,14,FSpeaking at the debate, Liberal
OL,15,FDemocrat MP for Glastonbury and
OL,16,FSomerton, Sarah Dyke, praised how
OL,17,Flocal agencies and volunteers have
OL,18,Fresponded to the crisis, but urged the
