OL,6,FChair of The Island Haven, Tim
OL,7,FGuthrie, said: "We are delighted to
OL,8,Fhave achieved this major milestone in
OL,9,Fthe charity's history, a goal only
OL,10,Fachieved because of the tireless
OL,11,Fefforts of Scilly's small albeit
OL,12,Fpassionate community of islanders,
OL,13,Flocal businesses and visitors.
OL,15,F"A combination of the COVID-19
OL,16,Fpandemic, the cost-of-living crisis
OL,17,Fand Scilly's small community of just
OL,18,F2,500 residents and around 100,000
OL,19,Fannual visitors has meant we have had
OL,20,Fto adapt our original plans of a
OL,21,Fpurpose-built facility.
