OL,6,FPC Jonathan Parker, a rural, wildlife
OL,7,Fand heritage crime officer at the
OL,8,Fforce, said: "Following an initial
OL,9,Fexamination of the swan, we now think
OL,10,Fthat it has been strangled, which is
OL,11,Futterly appalling.
OL,13,F"All wild birds are protected by law,
OL,14,Fand we are also looking into whether
OL,15,Fthe swan has been killed with
OL,16,Funnecessary cruelty, which would also
OL,17,Fbe an offence.
OL,19,F"I would urge anyone with any
OL,20,Finformation about the death of this
OL,21,Fmagnificent bird to come forward."
