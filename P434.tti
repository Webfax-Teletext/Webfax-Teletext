OL,6,FWhen my alarm went off this morning
OL,7,F(Thursday 27 June), I thought twice
OL,8,Fabout starting my day at Glastonbury
OL,9,FFestival with a five kilometre run.
OL,11,FThe unpredicted drizzle was enough to

OL,6,FWhen I arrived, I was overwhelmed by
OL,7,Fthe number of people who also thought
OL,8,Fit was a good idea to go for a run
OL,9,Faround Glastonbury, I imagine lots of
OL,10,Frevellers here couldn't imagine
OL,11,Fanything worse.
OL,13,FSpeaking with some of those attending,
OL,14,Fthere were a whole array of reasons
OL,15,Fwhy they'd turned out (some more
OL,16,Fbegrudgingly than others).
OL,18,F"It's something different at
OL,19,FGlastonbury, and supporting Greenpeace"

OL,6,FWith no further ado the run commenced

OL,9,Frunning up the incline proved a little

OL,11,Fwho was 58 and was "enjoying the
OL,12,Fchallenge", we encouraged each other
OL,13,Fall the way to the top - he was a big

OL,16,FOnce we made it up there, the view of
