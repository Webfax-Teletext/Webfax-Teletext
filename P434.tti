OL,6,FIn the 1950s a farmer could get #14
OL,7,Fper kilo of wool. Now it is worth less
OL,8,Fthan a pound, depending on colour and
OL,9,Fquality.
OL,11,FTo put that into perspective, if you
OL,12,Fhave a flock of 500 ewes you will only
OL,13,Fget a few hundred pounds from the wool.
OL,15,FBy the time farmers have paid shearers
OL,16,Fand labourers, farmers say they are
OL,17,Factually losing money.
OL,19,FThis has led some farmers to burn
OL,20,Ftheir wool, and others to choose for
OL,21,Fbreeds that shed their wool instead.
