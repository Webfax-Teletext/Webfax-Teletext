OL,8,Foperations at Longleat, said it is
OL,9,Fproving to be an "exciting" year for
OL,10,Fnew arrivals.
OL,12,FHe added: "The flamingo chicks should
OL,13,Fbe relatively easy for people to spot
OL,14,Fas they tour the safari park."
OL,16,FAll flamingo chicks are born with
OL,17,Fwhite plumage which they will keep for
OL,18,Faround three years and a straight bill
OL,19,Fwhich gradually droops down as the
OL,20,Fbird grows.

OL,7,FMr Beasley said: "It's interesting to
OL,8,Fnote that while the babies initially
OL,9,Fhave white or grey feathers as they
OL,10,Fgrow and develop, they will become
OL,11,Fpink. This is because the colour comes
OL,12,Fthrough from their diet,"
OL,14,F"In the wild flamingos eat small
OL,15,Fcrustaceans and other microscopic
OL,16,Fanimals and plants which are obtained
OL,17,Fby filter feeding.

OL,7,F"At Longleat they eat a special
OL,8,Fflamingo diet that contains pigments

OL,12,FWhen fully grown, flamingos are around
OL,13,F1.5m tall and can weigh anywhere up to
OL,14,F7kg.
OL,16,FThey live 15-20 years in the wild,
