OL,6,FFor the last three years, Charlie has
OL,7,Fbeen studying to become a nurse while
OL,8,Fworking as a healthcare assistant at
OL,9,Fthe RUH in Bath.
OL,11,FShe joined the NHS seven years ago
OL,12,Fwith no experience, having failed her
OL,13,Ffirst year of A Levels and decided
OL,14,Fthat the academic route was not for
OL,15,Fher.
OL,17,FShe then took on a number of
OL,18,Fapprenticeships while at the hospital,
OL,19,Fand went back to college to get her
OL,20,FGCSE in maths so that she could apply
OL,21,Ffor university.
