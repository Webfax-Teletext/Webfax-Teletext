OL,6,FEmmie Seward-Adams from the safety
OL,7,Fdelivery team explained: "It's very,
OL,8,Fvery unpredictable and there are
OL,9,Fstrong currents.
OL,11,F"The tidal changes can make those
OL,12,Fcurrents stronger, as can the surf and
OL,13,Fthe weather conditions as well.
OL,15,F"At the moment, we're in a period of
OL,16,Fnice warm weather which makes it even
OL,17,Fmore inviting, but we're also in a
OL,18,Fperiod of spring tides, which is a big
OL,19,Ftidal range, and a bigger volume of
OL,20,Fwater moving which makes those
OL,21,Fcurrents a lot stronger."
