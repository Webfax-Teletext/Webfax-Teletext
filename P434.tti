OL,4,Cby angry residents
OL,6,FThe popular tourist spot of Mousehole
OL,7,Fin Cornwall has been renamed 'binhole'
OL,8,Fby some residents because of the large
OL,9,Fnumbers of redundant wheelie bins
OL,10,Flining the streets.
OL,12,FThe bins have been left outside in
OL,13,Fclusters waiting to be picked up as
OL,14,Fpart of a change to rubbish
OL,15,Fcollections in Cornwall which has seen
OL,16,Fthe roll out of new grey bins. West
OL,17,FCornwall is the third part of the
OL,18,Fcounty to see the changes.

OL,12,FLocal resident Kim Hambleton said: "I
