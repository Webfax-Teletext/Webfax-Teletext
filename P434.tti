OL,13,FJo said: "There's not really any

OL,6,FIn response to Jo's criticism, SWW
OL,7,Fsaid it is currently investing #850m
OL,8,Fthis financial year, with one priority
OL,9,Fto reduce overflows at more than 150
OL,10,Ffifty bathing and shellfish areas.
OL,12,FJohn Halsall, the chief operating
OL,13,Fofficer of SWW, said in a statement:
OL,14,F"Like all our customers, including Ms
OL,15,FBateman, we care deeply about the

OL,17,Fwaters. It's always upsetting if

OL,8,Fwhich are an essential pressure

OL,15,FThe company intends to invest #38m in

OL,18,FJo has also said warnings about sewage
