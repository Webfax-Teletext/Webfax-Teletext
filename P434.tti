OL,6,FAboubacarr is only 10 years old. He
OL,7,Fwas not allowed to go out and play
OL,8,Fwith his friends for the weeks that
OL,9,Ffollowed the unrest because his
OL,10,Fparents were too worried.
OL,12,F"I've learnt about this happening in
OL,13,Fthe 1800s," he said. "That's like 224
OL,14,Fyears ago, so I didn't think that it
OL,15,Fwas going to happen again because that
OL,16,Fwas way before even my great-grandpa
OL,17,Fwas born, so I was actually scared
OL,18,Fknowing that it came back.

OL,11,F"There was riots going on behind my
