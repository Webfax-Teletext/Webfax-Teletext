OL,6,FIt comes as a peer-reviewed study
OL,7,Fpublished in the science journal,
OL,8,FNature, has revealed that in
OL,9,FGloucestershire, there has been a an
OL,10,Festimated 66% reduction in cases of
OL,11,FBovine TB after four years of culling.
OL,13,FIt also found this reduced by 37% in

OL,16,FThe badger cull was extremely

OL,10,FDespite this, James welcomed the

OL,17,Fhad to do it safely and effectively.

OL,11,F"The sense on the ground in this part
