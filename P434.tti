OL,6,FThe MP for North Cornwall has called
OL,7,Ffor a reform of the process for
OL,8,Fdeveloping offshore seaweed farms.
OL,10,FBen Maguire MP says there has been a
OL,11,Flack of fair consultation over three
OL,12,Fseaweed farms proposed near Port Isaac
OL,13,Fon Cornwall's north coast. One licence
OL,14,Fto operate has already been approved
OL,15,Fby the Marine Management Organisation
