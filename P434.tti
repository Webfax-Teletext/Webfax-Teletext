OL,8,Fcan't I have three?", he added.
OL,10,FPat Mitchell and Pauline Abbiss both
OL,11,Ffound themselves celebrating their
OL,12,F17th birthday today - but say they
OL,13,Ffeel older today than they did on

OL,16,F"I think the mind says 17, but the
OL,17,Fbody says otherwise," said Pat.
OL,19,FPauline added: "I think I was very

OL,21,Fand wiser moody (now)."
