OL,6,FIn January this year the High Court in
OL,7,FLondon dismissed Thatchers' case, with
OL,8,FJudge Melissa Clarke concluding there
OL,9,Fwas a low degree of similarity between
OL,10,Fthe products and no likelihood of
OL,11,Fconfusion for consumers.
OL,13,FOn Tuesday 17 December, Thatchers went
OL,14,Fto the Court of Appeal to challenge
OL,15,Fthe ruling.

OL,13,F"Thatchers respectfully say this is a
