OL,5,
OL,6,FSo the end looms for what was once
OL,7,FGrampian - the wee station with the big
OL,8,Fname.
OL,10,FIt lost its name and local programmes
OL,11,F20 years ago but its news service lived
OL,12,Fon.
OL,14,FThe STV News at Six in the northern
OL,15,Fhalf of Scotland was really North
OL,16,FTonight in disguise.
OL,18,FNow it too is to go.

OL,5,
OL,6,FSTV is proposing to change its news
OL,7,Fservice.
OL,9,FThere will, subject to Ofcom approval,
OL,10,Fbe one news service presented from
OL,11,FGlasgow for both central and northern
OL,12,FScotland.
OL,14,FThe financial situation facing STV is
OL,15,Fserious. It lost 200,000 in the first
OL,16,Fhalf of the year. Advertising is down
OL,17,F5m.
OL,19,FBut there is profound concern amongst
OL,20,Fpoliticians in the north of Scotland.

OL,5,

OL,9,FOr might sone compromise emerge? Or
OL,10,Feven outright rejection?
OL,12,FOfcom is not the poodle some accuse it

OL,15,FIn 2013 it helped reinstate a fuller
