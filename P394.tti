OL,7,Fbeen jailed after she took "carefully
OL,8,Fplanned steps" to defraud her company
OL,9,Fout of close to #130,000.
OL,11,FNicola Clarke had been abusing her
OL,12,Fposition at the Stockport-based firm
OL,13,FBusiness Computer Projects Ltd since
OL,14,F2008 to steal in "discreet ways."
OL,16,FMinshull Street Crown Court heard that
OL,17,Fthe 56-year-old had spent more than a

OL,6,FClarke, who had worked for the company
OL,7,Fsince 1987, was found out in June 2019
OL,8,Fwhen it was discovered she was using
OL,9,Fthe credit card. At the time, she

OL,13,Fbeen defrauding her employer for 11

OL,16,FA full investigation took place which

OL,20,Ffraud by abuse of position and was

OL,12,FHe said: "She paid herself overtime

OL,16,FAs the head of accounts, Clarke held

OL,14,FAfter Clarke's dismissal in 2019, the
