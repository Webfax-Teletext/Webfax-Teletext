OL,6,FHe told the court: "Some young women
OL,7,Fwere named by their own families as

OL,9,Fthe baby. They were arrested but
OL,10,Feliminated after a DNA comparison."
OL,12,FThe court heard two doctors gave the

OL,14,F"unascertained" and could not
OL,15,Fdetermine whether he had been alive
OL,16,Fwhen the tissue was put in his mouth.

OL,6,FNina Grahame KC, defending Sharkey,
OL,7,Fsaid: "Her primary intent throughout

OL,16,FShe added: "Were it not for her mental
