OL,13,Femotionally" after her #186,000
OL,14,Fmortgage, taken out in 2007, was
OL,15,Ftransferred by the government to TSB

OL,8,Fwithout me, my son, because I couldn't
OL,9,Fhandle the thought of having no home
OL,10,Ffor him. And that's been really
OL,11,Fdifficult.
OL,13,F"I've got two years and 10 months

OL,18,FTina's problems began when - as part
OL,19,Fof a bid to help grow her business -
OL,20,Fshe was advised to use the equity in
OL,21,Fher home to remortgage in 2007.
