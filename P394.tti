OL,6,FCheshire Police's Chief Constable has
OL,7,Fcriticised plans to close a CCTV
OL,8,Fcontrol room to cut costs.
OL,10,FMark Roberts said the closure of the

OL,12,F"will substantially diminish the
OL,13,Fnumber of arrests and is likely to
OL,14,Fresult in an increase in crime levels

OL,17,FWarrington Council are proposing to
OL,18,Fswitch to a "passive" system where
OL,19,Ffootage is still recorded but not
OL,20,Fmonitored live in order to save
