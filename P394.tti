OL,8,Fjust 46-years-old.
OL,10,FSteve died unexpectedly on a family
OL,11,Fholiday and Jane said she and her
OL,12,Ffamily found there was little help to
OL,13,Fsupport them.
OL,15,F"It was just a crazy time." Jane said.
OL,16,F"We were desperately trying to grasp
OL,17,Fhelp or support but here was just
OL,18,Fnothing around, other than
OL,19,Fcounselling."
