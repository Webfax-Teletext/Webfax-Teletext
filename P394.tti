OL,6,FThe murder - which took place in the
OL,7,Fhouse they both shared - had to have
OL,8,Fbeen planned because Marcin
OL,9,FMajerkiewicz had too many tools at his
OL,10,Ffingertips - and almost immediately
OL,11,Fafterwards, he started to chop up
OL,12,FStuart's body parts using a hacksaw,
OL,13,Fbefore casually dumping them across
OL,14,FGreater Manchester.
OL,16,FThe remains were scattered far and
OL,17,Fwide in the hope that nature would
OL,18,Ftake its course and it would be
OL,19,Fdifficult to identify them.

OL,6,FBut Majerkiewicz had hugely

OL,9,FPolice.
OL,11,FWhen Stuart's torso and thighs were
OL,12,Fdiscovered at a remote nature reserve
OL,13,Faround a week after he was murdered, a
OL,14,Fhuge investigation was launched.
OL,16,FOfficers had no clue who the victim
OL,17,Fwas, but they began to work on the
OL,18,Ffollowing hypothesis; whoever dumped
OL,19,Fthe remains must have done so on foot,
OL,20,Fas it's not possible to drive up to
OL,21,Fthat area of the park.
