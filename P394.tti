OL,6,FThe family of a retired NHS worker who
OL,7,Ftook his own life after suffering from
OL,8,Fchronic pain have called for urgent
OL,9,Fimprovements to the healthcare system
OL,10,Fafter it "failed one of their own".
OL,12,FTony Williamson, 63, a podiatrist with
OL,13,F37 years of NHS service, was diagnosed
OL,14,Fin late 2022 with prostatitis, a
OL,15,Fcondition causing severe pelvic pain.
OL,17,FThe pain significantly affected his
OL,18,Fmental health, leading to suicidal
OL,19,Fthoughts, and Tony attempted to take
OL,20,Fhis life five times before he was
OL,21,Fsuccessful.
