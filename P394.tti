OL,11,FShe still looks after her disabled

OL,13,FJohn at their home in Wythenshawe,

OL,16,FSusan says it's exhausting. "With John
OL,17,Fat the moment, it's everything,
OL,18,Fbecause he can't move so I'm cooking
OL,19,Fcleaning, he can hardly move out of
OL,20,Fthe chair I'm having to help him with
OL,21,Fhis walking and in the bath.
