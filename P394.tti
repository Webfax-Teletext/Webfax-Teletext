OL,10,Fwas walking her three Lupine dogs,
OL,11,FZues, Dax and Toki, by the Bridgewater

OL,13,Fhappened on 8 April.JThe 36-year-old
OL,14,Fsaid they were not far from home when
OL,15,Fshe noticed a man with an XL bully-
OL,16,Ftype dog walking ahead of them.
OL,17,FConcerned about the animal's
OL,18,Faggressive behaviour, Gemma clipped
OL,19,Felderly Toki onto her lead and kept
OL,20,Fthe other two dogs to the side of her.
OL,21,FAfter passing the dog and its owner,
OL,22,Fwho she said was struggling to keep it
OL,23,Funder control, she carried on walking
OL,24,Funtil she heard a noise behind her.
OL,25,FGemma then realised Toki's lead had
OL,26,Fbeen ripped from her hand and the dog
