OL,6,FManchester Pride's Board of Trustees
OL,7,Fhas announced the charity has begun
OL,8,Fthe process of voluntary liquidation.
OL,10,FIn a statement on Wednesday 22

OL,14,Flonger being financially viable."
OL,16,FThe charity is responsible for
OL,17,FManchester's annual pride events,
OL,18,Fwhich have taken place in August every
OL,19,Fyear since 1985 and drawn in hundreds
