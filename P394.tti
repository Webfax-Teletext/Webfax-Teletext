OL,7,Fwhich began on 10 February,
OL,8,FLancashire's Senior Coroner Dr James
OL,9,FAdeley concluded that her death was
OL,10,Fdue to "incompetence" from the

OL,13,FHe said: "Ida was a normal child whose
OL,14,Fdeath was caused by a lack of oxygen
OL,15,Fduring her delivery that occurred due
OL,16,Fto the gross failure of the three
OL,17,Fmidwives attending her to provide
