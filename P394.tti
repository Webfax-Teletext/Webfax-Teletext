OL,6,FSurvivors of one of Britain's worst
OL,7,Fairport disasters have recalled the
OL,8,Fmoment passengers became "hysterical,
OL,9,Fscreaming, and crying" as their plane
OL,10,Ffilled with "thick black, kind of
OL,11,Facrid smoke".
OL,13,FSylvia Chappell was 29 when she
OL,14,Fboarded British Airtours Flight 28M at
OL,15,FManchester Airport bound for Cofu on
OL,16,F22 August 1985 with a friend.
OL,18,FBut within seconds of taking to the
OL,19,Frunway a loud thump was heard from the
OL,20,FBoeing 737, as an engine exploded,
OL,21,Fgenerating a fire which quickly spread.
