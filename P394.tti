OL,7,Factivists set up Manchester AIDSline
OL,8,Fin response to the arrival of the HIV
OL,9,Fvirus in Manchester. The City Council
OL,10,Fformed an 'AIDS Working Party' and the
OL,11,FNorth Western Regional Health
OL,12,FAuthority began to support Manchester
OL,13,FAIDSline financially. As support
OL,14,Fdeveloped, they began providing more
OL,15,Ftargeted and tailored services, such a
OL,16,Fbefriending support and information
OL,17,Fresources for professionals. The
OL,18,FAIDSline changed it's name to George
