OL,6,FThe Home Secretary has insisted that
OL,7,Flocal inquiries into grooming gangs in
OL,8,Ffive towns will be going ahead despite
OL,9,Faccusations the plans were being
OL,10,Fwatered down.
OL,12,FYvette Cooper rejected the claim and
OL,13,Fblamed "party political

OL,15,Freviews were being progressed.
OL,17,FSpeaking on Good Morning Britain she
OL,18,Fsaid Oldham would be the first town to
OL,19,Fhold an inquiry, and that victims and
OL,20,Fsurvivors would be offered more
OL,21,Fsupport to deal with their experiences.
