OL,7,FBroadcaster Richard Hammond has
OL,8,Fdescribed the the Isle of Man TT as
OL,9,F'astonishing' as he witnessed the
OL,10,Faction for the very first time.
OL,12,FThe TV presenter watched from the
OL,13,Froadside during Saturday afternoon's
OL,14,Fqualifying session.
OL,16,FHe said: "It's been epic thus far. I
OL,17,Fhave to say 39 years I've been riding
OL,18,Fmotorcycles - they're a huge part of
OL,19,Fmy life. This, I'm slightly ashamed to
OL,20,Fsay, is my first ever TT and it's
OL,21,Feverything I thought it would be.

OL,10,Fof this afternoon before the weather

OL,12,Fextraordinary.
OL,14,F"I mean, I love riding motorcycles on

OL,16,Ffamiliar with the kind of almost
OL,17,Fsuburban world and motorsports and
OL,18,Fmushed them together to create a

OL,13,FHammond also took the opportunity to
OL,14,Fengage in other activities outside of

OL,17,FOn Sunday 1 June, he led the 'TT
