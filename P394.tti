OL,9,Fwith a donated rockstar tour bus -
OL,10,Fwhich was home to 12 men.
OL,12,F"People do die," Mr Williams told ITV
OL,13,FNews, "on the streets just from
OL,14,Fhypothermia.
OL,16,F"It's awful. We are literally building
OL,17,Fa village right here in the middle of
OL,18,FManchester for homeless people only.
