OL,6,FLiam Farrell wrapped up an historic
OL,7,FChallenge Cup final win for Wigan at
OL,8,FWembley then hailed the "special"
OL,9,Fsquad that has every chance of
OL,10,Fcontributing more to his bulging

OL,8,Fclear onto a sharp Jai Field off-load
OL,9,Fto effectively seal an 18-8 win

OL,11,Fthe first side since St Helens in 2007
