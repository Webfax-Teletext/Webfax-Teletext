OL,7,FTraditionally, the Admiral of the Manx

OL,7,FAt that point in history, the herring
OL,8,Ffishery was a largely directed
OL,9,Factivity, almost like a military
OL,10,Foperation, to ensure food security and
OL,11,Feconomic prosperity.
OL,13,FNowadays, the support of the recently

OL,15,Fundertaken collaboratively between the
