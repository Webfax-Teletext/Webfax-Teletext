OL,6,FThough starlings are one of the most
OL,7,Fcommon birds in the United Kingdom,
OL,8,Fthey are increasingly under threat due
OL,9,Fto habitat loss and the changing
OL,10,Fclimate. As a result they are now on
OL,11,Fthe RSPB red list.
OL,13,FFittingly, an exhibition at the Bowes
OL,14,FMuseum called Murmuration currently
OL,15,Fexplores the relationship humans have
OL,16,Fwith birds, the environment and the
OL,17,Fimpact people have on both.

OL,11,Fsaid: "We know that there is a climate
OL,12,Femergency, we know that's something we
OL,13,Fall need to engage in.
OL,15,F"I think that doing that as a museum,
OL,16,Fworking with artwork, objects and
OL,17,Fworking with artists it can be a soft
OL,18,Fway of putting things beautiful and
OL,19,Finteresting and thought provoking in
