OL,6,F"She's managed to survive that long
OL,7,Fbecause she was built entirely from
OL,8,Fteak," said Clare Hunt, principal
OL,9,Fcurator at the National Museum of the
OL,10,FRoyal Navy. "It's a really superior
OL,11,Ftimber for building ships from.
OL,13,F"In this country we were building
OL,14,Fships from oak which just doesn't
OL,15,Fsurvive like teak does. That's really
OL,16,Fthe reason she survives the way she
OL,17,Fdoes."

OL,20,Fundertook duties including policing,
OL,21,Fprotection, and exploration.
