OL,8,FMetro operations director, said:
OL,9,F"Stadler is working to urgently deal
OL,10,Fwith a Metro fleet availability issue,
OL,11,Fwhich is impacting our ability to
OL,12,Fprovide a full service for our
OL,13,Fcustomers.
OL,15,F"This has been caused by a faulty
OL,16,Fbatch of carbon strips, an essential
OL,17,Fcomponent of the pantographs which are
OL,18,Fused to power Metro trains from the
OL,19,Foverhead line.
