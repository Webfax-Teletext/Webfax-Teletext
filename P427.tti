OL,6,FLast month Kwan, of Ingleby Barwick,
OL,7,Fnear Stockton, was jailed for 31 years
OL,8,Ffor attempted murder.
OL,10,FSpeaking on This Morning on Monday (9
OL,11,FDecember), Mr O'Hara recalled the
OL,12,Fattack in January this year and the
OL,13,Flasting impact it has had on his
OL,14,Fphysical and mental health.
OL,16,FThe 72-year-old described the moment
OL,17,FKwan's needle containing poison
OL,18,Fentered his arm as "indescribable" and
OL,19,Fsaid he immediately suspected his now
OL,20,Fformer partner Jenny Leung's son.

OL,13,FAsked by presenter Ben Shephard if he

OL,6,FNewcastle Crown Court previously heard
OL,7,Fthat 53-year-old Kwan hatched a plan
OL,8,Fto kill the long-term partner of his
OL,9,Fmother in a bid to cut him out of her
OL,10,Fwill.
OL,12,FMs Leung's will stated that Mr O'Hara
OL,13,Fcould remain living in her property

OL,7,FBen Shephard and Cat Deeley that Kwan
OL,8,Fand his mother had already become
OL,9,Fsomewhat estranged over conflict
OL,10,Frelating to inheritance and finances.
OL,12,FHe added that there was therefore
OL,13,F"irony" in the fact his relationship
OL,14,Fwith Ms Leung was coming to an end
OL,15,Fwhen Kwan launched his attack.
OL,17,FMr O'Hara also agreed that the
OL,18,Fattempted murder became the "catalyst"
