OL,6,FMany store chains have been installing
OL,7,Fthe doors in recent months in an
OL,8,Feffort to save energy, as without
OL,9,Fdoors much of the cold air escapes
OL,10,Ffrom the fridge into the rest of the
OL,11,Fstore, meaning energy is wasted.
OL,13,FBut Flick Williams told ITV News that,
OL,14,Ffor her and other wheelchair users,
OL,15,Fthe doors can severely impact their
OL,16,Fability to shop independently.
