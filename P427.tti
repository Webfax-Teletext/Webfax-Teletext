OL,6,FThe Transporter Bridge is at risk of
OL,7,F"catastrophic collapse", a new report
OL,8,Fhas found.
OL,10,FThe Grade II-listed bridge, which used
OL,11,Fto connect Port Clarence to
OL,12,FMiddlesbrough, closed in 2019 due to
OL,13,Fsafety concerns.
OL,15,FA structural assessment, carried out
OL,16,Fthis month, has found "significant"
OL,17,Fsigns of stress in parts of the
OL,18,Fbridge's structure which is now
OL,19,Fconsidered an immediate and
OL,20,Funacceptable safety risk to the public.

OL,6,FMiddlesbrough Council, which manages

OL,12,FA spokesman said the safety of the
OL,13,Fpublic is its "paramount concern" and
OL,14,Fthey were working with Atkins to
OL,15,Fregularly check the bridge's condition.
OL,17,F"We are not at a point where an
