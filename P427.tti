OL,6,FThe miners' strike brought 12 months
OL,7,Fof hardship to the people of the
OL,8,Fcoalfields of County Durham and
OL,9,FNorthumberland.
OL,11,FBut for some communities, the
OL,12,Fsuffering did not end in March 1985.
OL,14,FIn Easington, a former pit village in
OL,15,FCounty Durham, ex-miner Stephen Fergus
OL,16,Fsaid what followed was "40 years of
OL,17,Fpain".
