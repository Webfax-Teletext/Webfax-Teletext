OL,6,FThe final sign-off on funding to
OL,7,Fsecure the future of the Shields Ferry
OL,8,Fhas been delayed.
OL,10,FIt was anticipated that members of the
OL,11,FNorth East Joint Transport Committee
OL,12,Fwould give the green light to the
OL,13,Frelease of #4.58 million for a new
OL,14,Fferry landing in North Shields at a
OL,15,Fmeeting on Tuesday (16 April).
OL,17,FHowever, due to a number of absences
OL,18,Famong councillors, the meeting was
OL,19,F"inquorate" ` meaning the decision
OL,20,Fcould not be taken.

OL,6,FBecause the meeting was the

OL,15,FThere was an opportunity for members
OL,16,Fto debate the issue and ask questions
OL,17,Fto offer guidance to officers, but

OL,8,Fwhich saw single track sections of the

OL,12,FThe existing jetty in North Shields is
OL,13,Fdue to fall into an unusable state as
