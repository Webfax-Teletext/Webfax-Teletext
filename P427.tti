OL,6,FDr Deborah Stalker, an expert

OL,13,FShe told the jury on Tuesday (26

OL,15,FCharlie suffered the bruised ear while
OL,16,Fsleep-walking.
OL,18,FShe said: "In my opinion, this is a

OL,20,Fit is a purposefully-inflicted injury.

OL,4,Cboy's bruising was 'no accident'
OL,6,F"Accidental injuries to the ear are
OL,7,Fvery rare."
OL,9,FShe explained that the shoulder or
OL,10,Fhead usually take the impact of a
OL,11,Ffall, rather than an ear.
OL,13,F"To injure the ear with the type of
OL,14,Finjuries that you see on Charlie's ear
OL,15,Frequires a direct blow," Dr Stalker
OL,16,Fsaid.
OL,18,FShe dismissed the claim that Charlie
OL,19,Fcould have bruised an ear while sleep-
OL,20,Fwalking, saying: "Simple falls do not
OL,21,Fcause ear injuries.
