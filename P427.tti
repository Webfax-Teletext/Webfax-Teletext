OL,15,Fsaid: "Despite being shocked at being
OL,16,Fcut off by the incoming tide, the

OL,6,F"Our RNLI crews and lifeguards respond

OL,8,Fwith people cut off by the tide,
OL,9,Fespecially because people out walking
OL,10,Fcan find themselves cut off
OL,11,Funexpectedly, just like the two
OL,12,Fcasualties had today.
OL,14,F"Had they not called when they had and
OL,15,Fnot known their location, the
OL,16,Fcasualties may have found themselves
OL,17,Fin a much more dangerous situation."
