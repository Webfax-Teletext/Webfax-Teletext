OL,6,FIn an email, vice-chancellor and chief
OL,7,Fexecutive Professor Andy Long wrote
OL,8,Fthat savings are needed "in order to
OL,9,Fensure we are able to cover our

OL,11,Fcan" to avoid compulsory redundancies.
OL,13,FHe blamed a "volatile" market for
OL,14,Frecruiting students from overseas and
OL,15,Fthe Government making it "more
OL,16,Fdifficult" to do so, saying the
