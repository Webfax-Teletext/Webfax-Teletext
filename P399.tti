OL,6,FThe project to restore the iconic Lido
OL,7,Fin Grange-Over-Sands has hit a delay
OL,8,Fafter it became clear that the

OL,13,FWestmorland and Furness Council say
OL,14,Fthat though the bulk of the work has
OL,15,Fnow been completed, further assessment
OL,16,Fof the work still needed to complete
OL,17,Fthe project is necessary, pushing back

OL,8,F"The Lido is a significant and unique

OL,11,FWestmorland and Furness and beyond.
OL,13,F"While it is frustrating that the

OL,15,Fdue to further assessment of the
OL,16,Frepairs required to complete the
OL,17,Fproject, it highlights the complexity
OL,18,Fof working with historic assets of
