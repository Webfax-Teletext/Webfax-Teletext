OL,6,FBut after bad weather in early summer
OL,7,Fmeant the usual crop of more than
OL,8,F150,000 pumpkins was reduced to just
OL,9,F600 - with a potential loss of half
OL,10,Ftheir annual income - the
OL,11,F"heartbroken" family-owned farm was
OL,12,Fforced to change its plans.
OL,14,FFarmer Jonathan Hewitt said: "When we
OL,15,Fdrilled the seeds back in May time,
OL,16,Fthe end of May into June went very wet
OL,17,Fand cooler than conditions would
OL,18,Fnormally happen.

OL,6,F"When we would normally get to see the

OL,8,Fseeds that were germinating, but it
OL,9,Fjust wasn't happening enough.
OL,11,F"We had to think of something very

OL,17,F"There is nothing worse than us having

OL,20,Fas it would have generated half the

OL,6,FThe farm found the answer in their 20
