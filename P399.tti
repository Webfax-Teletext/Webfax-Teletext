OL,6,FMark Rhind KC, representing Chapman,
OL,7,Ftold the court his sentence was
OL,8,F"manifestly excessive".
OL,10,FThe barrister said the challenge was
OL,11,Fnot seeking to "minimise the

OL,13,Fseriousness of what he's done".
OL,15,FHe said it was conceded it was an
OL,16,F"extremely serious case" with
OL,17,F"numerous aggravating features",
OL,18,Fadding that, whatever the outcome of
OL,19,Fthe appeal bid, Chapman would spend
OL,20,F"decades in prison, perhaps his entire

OL,6,FMr Rhind said: "As bad as this

OL,9,Fcases and a minimum term in this case
OL,10,Fof 48 years leaves no room those even

OL,14,FHe also argued Chapman's young age at

OL,16,F"small degree of mitigation" and said
