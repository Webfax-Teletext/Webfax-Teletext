OL,11,Fmaintained that the final word meant

OL,6,FPirjani however said "no, that's not

OL,8,F"didn't like the fact that Miguel was

OL,10,Fdifficulties" to which he replied:
OL,11,F"How can you say I didn't like Miguel
OL,12,Fif I never missed an appointment? How
OL,13,Fdidn't I care for my son?"
OL,15,FMr Bowers then said: "You cared so

OL,17,Fidea how he came by 41 fractures and
OL,18,Fsuffered a fatal blow to the head. Is
