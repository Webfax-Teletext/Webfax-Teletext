OL,6,FThe Honorary Recorder of Liverpool

OL,8,Fwho the trial, said: "In this case,
OL,9,Fthe defendant does not deny that he
OL,10,Fwas responsible for sadly killing his
OL,11,Fstepfather. It seems that - while
OL,12,FBenjamin Moglione's mother was in the

OL,14,Fto be in bed - he had taken a kitchen

OL,18,Fway caused his death.
