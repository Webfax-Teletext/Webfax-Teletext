OL,7,FAt an inquest in Accrington, heard she
OL,8,Fwould have probably survived if medics
OL,9,Fhad not checked the wrong documents.
OL,11,FArea Coroner, Kate Bisset, said : "I
OL,12,Fam satisfied that Mrs Dawson would not
OL,13,Fhave died, at that point, if the care
OL,14,Fshe had received had been different."
OL,16,FPat's family described her as "fit and
OL,17,Fhealthy", saying she had not been to
OL,18,Fvisit her GP in more than three
OL,19,Fdecades and never visited A&E.
