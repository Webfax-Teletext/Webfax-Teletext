OL,6,FInspector Sophie Smith said: "We
OL,7,Fbelieve the thefts were targeted as it
OL,8,Fwas specialised machinery which were
OL,9,Fstolen and they had the means to be
OL,10,Fable to transport it away.

OL,13,Fwere in the area to check their dash
OL,14,Fcam, CCTV or doorbell footage to see
OL,15,Fif they may have captured something
OL,16,Fwhich may be vital to the
