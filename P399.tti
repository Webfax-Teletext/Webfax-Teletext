OL,8,FFor many, playing the recorder or
OL,9,Fclanging a triangle at school was a
OL,10,Fritual part of growing up, but one
OL,11,Fmusical group in Manchester is
OL,12,Foffering people a chance to play a
OL,13,Fmore unusual instrument - the
OL,14,FBalalaika.
OL,16,FThe Balalaika is a Russian string
OL,17,Finstrument, similar to a triangular
OL,18,Fguitar, but with only three strings.

OL,6,FKalinka in Chorlton is England's only
OL,7,FBalalaika orchestra. Founded in 1984,
OL,8,Fit's the only musical group of its
OL,9,Fkind in the UK and is on the hunt for
OL,10,Fnew members.
OL,12,FFounder Brian Hulme, 82, leads a group
OL,13,Fof 20 musicians, the youngest aged
OL,14,Fjust nine years old, who meet weekly.
OL,16,FFamously used on Kate Bush's track
OL,17,FRunning Up That Hill, the instrument
OL,18,Fhas an enduring appeal but Brian is
OL,19,Fconcerned that if new members don't
OL,20,Fjoin, Kalinka may disappear.

OL,6,FHe says it's important to separate the

OL,12,FHe said: "It's a very simple
