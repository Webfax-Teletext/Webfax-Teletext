OL,6,FIt was recovered from the depths in
OL,7,F2001 by Bill Smith, an engineer from
OL,8,Fthe North East, who had become
OL,9,Ffascinated with finding Bluebird and
OL,10,Frestoring it. Mr Campbell's body was
OL,11,Frecovered months later.
OL,13,FThe engineering team had been diving
OL,14,Ffor four years before they finally
OL,15,Ffound the wreckage, and insisted on
OL,16,Frestoring it as close to the original
OL,17,Fplan as possible. A bitter row over
OL,18,Fthe craft's ownership then ensued,
OL,19,Fleaving questions over its future home.
