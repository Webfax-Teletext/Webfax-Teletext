OL,6,FManchester's Moss Side is an area that
OL,7,Fbecame synonymous with gun crime and
OL,8,Fgang violence in the 1980s and 90s.
OL,10,FAnd while so-called drive-by attacks
OL,11,Fare a thing of the past, many in the
OL,12,Fcommunity are still affected by the
OL,13,Ftrauma of young people losing their
OL,14,Flives.
OL,16,FMoss Side developed a reputation
OL,17,Fthat's been difficult to shift -
OL,18,Fdespite the huge amount of work done
OL,19,Fin the community to change things for
OL,20,Fthe better.
