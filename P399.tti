OL,12,F"We don't like to have favourites, but

OL,16,F"She only had him for about nine

OL,18,Fwas a special one because they had so

OL,10,Fstepped in to help.
OL,12,F"Cola is the first dog, he may even be

OL,16,F"I'm hoping the prosthetics will be

OL,12,F"He'll go out for an hour and a half
