OL,6,FThe dunes on North Beach, near St
OL,7,FAnnes in Lancashire, are part of a
OL,8,FSite of Special Scientific Interest
OL,9,F(SSSI) and plays a crucial role in
OL,10,Fproviding habitat for flora, fauna and
OL,11,Frare species of international and
OL,12,Fnational importance.
OL,14,FBut over the 150 years, the area has
OL,15,Flost more than 80% of its dunes due to
OL,16,Fcoastal town expansion - and with
OL,17,Fthem, the natural protection that
OL,18,Fkeeps our doorsteps dry and our
OL,19,Fwildlife safe.

OL,6,FOnce buried, the trees stabilise the

OL,8,Fand provide a more stable environment

OL,13,FAmy Pennington from Lancashire

OL,15,Freally well as a soft sea defence when

OL,18,Fbetween the land and the sea.
