OL,6,FThe director of Ronaldsway Airport
OL,7,Fsaid he hopes all runway closures will
OL,8,Fbe lifted "towards the back end of
OL,9,Fsummer", following months of daily
OL,10,Fbreaks.
OL,12,FSince August 2023 the runway closes
OL,13,Fdaily in the morning between the hours
OL,14,Fof 08:30 and 09:05, and 11:00 and
OL,15,F11:35 due to staffing shortages.
OL,17,FGary Cobb said the situation at the
OL,18,Fisland's airport has improved in the
OL,19,Fpast year, but the air traffic control
OL,20,Ftower is still not operating at full
OL,21,Fcapacity.

OL,6,FGary said: "We still continue at two

OL,9,Fexit all of the breaks in one go.
OL,11,F"So you won't see a lessening of that.
OL,12,FIt will just be a complete removal of
OL,13,Fthe breaks. And again, I'm hopeful
OL,14,Fthat towards the back end of summer is
OL,15,Fa position that we can do."

OL,6,FGary said: "The big issue now will be
OL,7,Fthe training of these air traffic

OL,10,F"We could actually go out and get the
OL,11,F18 now, but as we've got so many
OL,12,Fpeople in training, they would
OL,13,Factually be sat around waiting for a

OL,16,F"So we've made that conscious choice
