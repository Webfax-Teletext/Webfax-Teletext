OL,6,FShe said: "I was active, I was out and
OL,7,Fabout, doing lots of work around the
OL,8,Fhomeless, so we used to deliver quilts
OL,9,Fand blankets for the homeless so I
OL,10,Fused to spend my time going into town
OL,11,Finto Manchester and doing that."
OL,13,F"I felt a bit unwell and I assumed at
OL,14,Fthat time it was a chest infection and
OL,15,Fthat's what I was treated for in that
OL,16,Ftime," Juliette said.
OL,18,FIn August 2021, she was admitted into
OL,19,Fhospital where she was put onto a ward
OL,20,Fwith other people and eventually moved
OL,21,Fto a room on her own.
