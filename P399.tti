OL,6,F"The councillor promises a 'robust
OL,7,Fsuite of in-house services' yet has
OL,8,Fnot confirmed what exactly these are.
OL,9,FThere is huge risk moving services in-
OL,10,Fhouse to the council. As an example,
OL,11,Fwhile council offices closed its
OL,12,Fservices over Christmas ` including
OL,13,Fthe teams managing domestic abuse
OL,14,Fcases - our dedicated team supported
OL,15,F700 people in crisis. This is the
OL,16,Fdifference specialist domestic abuse
OL,17,Fsupport makes. Domestic abuse doesn't
OL,18,Fwait for office hours - and this is
OL,19,Fwhat we must protect.
