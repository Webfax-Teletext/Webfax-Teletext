OL,8,Fdays, would have been very different
OL,9,Fto the experience of crews today.
OL,11,F"It must have been pretty grim for
OL,12,Fthem in the open boats, primitive
OL,13,Fequipment, primitive waterproofs and
OL,14,Fthey did endure a lot of heavy weather
OL,15,Fbecause that's when the big ships run
OL,16,Faground," he said.
OL,18,F"So when they did go out, it must have
OL,19,Fbeen hard work, constantly covered in
OL,20,Fwater."
