OL,6,FSunderland's rich history is told by
OL,7,Fthousands of objects on display in the
OL,8,FMuseum and Winter Gardens. Behind the
OL,9,Fscenes there are even more treasures,
OL,10,Fhidden away in 19 store rooms all
OL,11,Fpacked to the brim.J"Around nine of
OL,12,Fthem haven't been opened for a long
OL,13,Fperiod of time." Anneke Hackenbroich,
OL,14,FCollections Care Manager, explains.
OL,15,F"When I started you actually couldn't
OL,16,Fopen the roller racking system,
OL,17,Fobjects were piled so high on top."
OL,18,FAnneke has been brought in to explore
OL,19,Fthe archives, funded by a three
OL,20,Fhundred thousand pounds grant from the
OL,21,FNational Lottery Heritage Fund,
OL,22,Fawarded to help draw up detailed plans
OL,23,Ffor a multi-million pound re
OL,24,Fdevelopment of the museum.

OL,6,FIn the autumn, a bid will be made for
OL,7,FLottery funding to support an 11
OL,8,Fmillion pound revamp of the Museum and

OL,11,FProposals include the potential to
OL,12,Fmove the main entrance into Mowbray

OL,14,Fwith a new central atrium space and
OL,15,Fnew galleries as well as more family

OL,18,FThe redevelopment will also create a

OL,6,F"At first I thought, 'wow, this is
OL,7,Fgoing to be a big job'", Anneke said.
OL,8,F"But I quite enjoy it as like a big
OL,9,Ftreasure hunt, because you open a box
OL,10,Fand you never know what you actually
OL,11,Fmight find."JFrom toys to tools, the
OL,12,Faim is to decide which objects should
OL,13,Fbe displayed in future.
OL,15,FMany of the boxes being opened haven't
OL,16,Fbeen seen in years and the contents
OL,17,Faren't recorded.

OL,6,FA few weeks later, unidentified,

OL,8,FIt's believed the tags were passes to

OL,14,FConsultation with people across
