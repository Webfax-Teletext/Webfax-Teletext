OL,6,FIt has been 40 years since the
OL,7,Fdecision was made to bring Nissan to
OL,8,FWearside: making Sunderland a giant in
OL,9,Fcar manufacturing, and changing the
OL,10,Fcourse of the lives of local workers
OL,11,Fand the local economy.
OL,13,FA small team had worked on the project

OL,15,Fsuccessfully bringing the biggest
OL,16,Fforeign investment of its kind in the
