OL,6,FThe RSPCA believe he could have been

OL,8,Fbefore he was found by a curious dog
OL,9,Fwalker who spotted that the lid to a
OL,10,Flarge hole in the ground was partially
OL,11,Fopen, looking down to see Badger stuck
OL,12,Fat the bottom.
OL,14,F"It was a complete stroke of luck that
