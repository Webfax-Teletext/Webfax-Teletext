OL,11,FKev Byrne, from the Ouseburn Trust,

OL,13,Fsaid: "It was built when the

OL,16,Fwere two gentlemen who wanted to be

OL,10,FWith costs making the project

OL,12,Fbuild the tunnel in an old glacial

OL,8,Fhide out when the air raid siren
OL,9,Fsounded. You would have them down here
OL,10,Ffor maybe 12 hours at a time.
OL,12,F"They were down there for considerably
OL,13,Flonger than other towns and cities
OL,14,Fbecause the Luftwaffe was using
OL,15,FNewcastle as a navigational aid, so
OL,16,Fthey would fly over, drop their bombs
