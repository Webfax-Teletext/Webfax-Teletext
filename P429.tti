OL,7,FIt is 100 years since Ramsay MacDonald
OL,8,Fbecame the first Labour Prime Minister
OL,9,Fand the politician continues to divide

OL,12,FMacDonald was first invited to form a
OL,13,Fgovernment by George V following a
OL,14,Fclose general election, leading

OL,7,F"He was probably the most working-
OL,8,Fclass Prime Minister the UK has ever
OL,9,Fhad," explained political writer and
OL,10,Fhistorian David Torrance. "He was
OL,11,Fillegitimate, he didn't know his
OL,12,Ffather, he grew up in grinding poverty
OL,13,Fin the North of Scotland."
OL,15,FHowever, it was not to last and
OL,16,FMacDonald was replaced by Stanley
OL,17,FBaldwin nine months later as the
OL,18,FConservatives won the next general
