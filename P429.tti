OL,6,FAfter 14 years, the popular ITV drama
OL,7,FVera has come to an end, but the
OL,8,Fauthor of the book series it was based
OL,9,Fon has revealed it was only by chance
OL,10,Fthat it ever hit our screens in the
OL,11,Ffirst place.
OL,13,FAnn Cleeves released the first of the
OL,14,FVera books in 1999. It was called The
OL,15,FCrow Trap and introduced us to DCI
OL,16,FVera Stanhope, as she investigated a
OL,17,Fmurder at a remote cottage in
OL,18,FNorthumberland.
