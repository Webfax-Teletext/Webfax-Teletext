OL,6,FMiddlesbrough Mayor, Chris Cooke, told
OL,7,Fthe Local Democracy Reporting Service,
OL,8,Fthe museum closure was readdressed due
OL,9,Fto the depth of feeling against the
OL,10,Fplans. As reported a petition was
OL,11,Flaunched and signed by more than 8,000
OL,12,Fpeople.
OL,14,FMr Cooke said he attended meetings
OL,15,Fabout the plans and the feedback was
OL,16,Ftaken on board. He said: "There was a
OL,17,Freal strength of feeling about this
OL,18,Fproposal but it was more of a
OL,19,Fwillingness of people coming together
OL,20,Fto make other suggestions and 20
OL,21,Fvolunteers have come forward to help."
