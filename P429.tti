OL,6,FAs the RNLI marks its 200th year of
OL,7,Fsaving lives at sea nationwide, there
OL,8,Fis only one station in the country to
OL,9,Fhave reached the same milestone age.
OL,11,FTynemouth Lifeboat Station has
OL,12,Factually been in operation for longer
OL,13,Fthan the RNLI itself. Its roots began
OL,14,Fin the 1700s when fishermen would
OL,15,Fvolunteer to row out on rescues along
OL,16,Fthe Tyne and up and down the North Sea
OL,17,Fcoast.
OL,19,FThe RNLI then took on the lifeboats
OL,20,Fand made the station what it is today.

OL,10,FCoxswain Sam Clow told ITV Tyne Tees:
OL,11,F"It's great to be a little part of a
OL,12,F200-year history.
OL,14,F"We refer to the lifeboat men of old
OL,15,Fas steel men in wooden boats that used
OL,16,Fto don their cork lifejacket and row
OL,17,Fout into a storm.

OL,13,FGeorge William, volunteer crew member,

OL,6,F"I think with our piece of kit like

OL,12,FMr William was inspired to join the
OL,13,FRNLI by his grandfather who was a
OL,14,Ffisherman and says it was a privilege
OL,15,Fto know anyone in the RNLI in those
OL,16,Fdays.
OL,18,FThe station that stands on the Fish
