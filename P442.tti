OL,10,Frestrictions on the movement of those
OL,11,Fgoods ` these new arrangements remove

OL,14,F"Zero checks, zero customs paperwork
OL,15,Fon goods moving within the United
OL,16,FKingdom. That takes away the border
OL,17,Fwithin the UK between Northern Ireland
OL,18,Fand Great Britain and that is
OL,19,Fsomething that's very important.
