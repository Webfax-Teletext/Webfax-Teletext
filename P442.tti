OL,6,FA health trust has been criticised for
OL,7,Funnecessarily restraining an autistic
OL,8,Fchild after it failed to properly
OL,9,Fmonitor a school's use of specialist
OL,10,Fseating.
OL,12,FThe report, by the Northern Ireland
OL,13,FPublic Services Ombudsman, also said
OL,14,Fthe Western Trust did not fully assess
OL,15,Fthe child's needs before approving the
OL,16,Fchairs, nor ask his parents for
OL,17,Fconsent on their use.
OL,19,FIt also criticised the trust for not
OL,20,Fgiving the school instructions on how
OL,21,Fthey should be used.

OL,8,Fmother.
OL,10,FHer son, who is non-verbal but can
OL,11,Fwalk unaided, used a special chair at

OL,14,FThe report said when the school

OL,17,Fthe trust to add a wheeled base to the

OL,6,FThe investigation found that there was

OL,9,Fand no assessment of whether he could
