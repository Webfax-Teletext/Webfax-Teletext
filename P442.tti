OL,7,FThe son of convicted double murderer
OL,8,FColin Howell has spoken for the first
OL,9,Ftime to UTV describing how 'his life
OL,10,Ffell apart' when he found out his
OL,11,Ffather had killed his mother Lesley
OL,12,Fand his then lover Hazel Stewart's
OL,13,Fhusband Trevor Buchanan - staging it
OL,14,Fto look like a suicide pact.
OL,16,FIn May 1991, police originally thought
OL,17,Fthe deaths of Lesley Howell and Trevor
OL,18,FBuchanan were suicide after their
OL,19,Fbodies were found in a fume-filled
OL,20,Fgarage in Castlerock.
