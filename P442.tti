OL,6,FNorthern Ireland's deputy first

OL,8,Fpresident Michael D Higgins for
OL,9,Fraising the ongoing conflict in Gaza
OL,10,Fduring his speech to an annual
OL,11,FHolocaust memorial event in Dublin.
OL,13,FEmma Little-Pengelly said the
OL,14,FRepublic's president was "absolutely
OL,15,Fwrong" to raise the issues, accusing
OL,16,Fhim of "politicising" the event.
OL,18,FFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill,
OL,19,Fhowever, defended Mr Higgins saying he
OL,20,Fwas expressing his personal views
OL,21,Fwhich was "his business".
