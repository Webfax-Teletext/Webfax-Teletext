OL,6,FThe former chair of the Belfast Trust
OL,7,Fhas said he was sacked because the
OL,8,FHealth Minister needed a "scapegoat"
OL,9,Ffollowing allegations of bullying and
OL,10,Fpoor behaviour within the organisation.
OL,12,FSpeaking exclusively to UTV, Ciaran
OL,13,FMulgrew said he was told Mike Nesbitt
OL,14,Fmade the decision for "political
OL,15,Freasons" and was actually advised
OL,16,Fagainst removing him by the Permanent
OL,17,FSecretary.
OL,19,FHe also said he was fired from his
