OL,6,FRichard Pengelly, chief executive of
OL,7,Fthe Education Authority, which
OL,8,Fdelivers all education services in the
OL,9,Fregion, said he expects the budget to
OL,10,Fbe "incredibly difficult".
OL,12,FHe appeared before the Stormont
OL,13,FEducation committee on Wednesday, just
OL,14,Fover a week into his post.
OL,16,F"I don't think anyone in public
OL,17,Fservice provision is under any
OL,18,Fillusions that whatever the budget is,
OL,19,Fit's going to be incredibly
OL,20,Fdifficult," he said.

OL,6,F"So the brutal reality is we're not
