OL,7,FA man from Co Down with pneumonia had
OL,8,Fto spend three days on a chair in an
OL,9,Femergency department (ED) corridor
OL,10,Fbefore then being diagnosed with
OL,11,Fcancer.
OL,13,FDavid Collins described his time in
OL,14,Fthe corridor as "just chaos" and has
OL,15,Ftold UTV that the he hopes he never
OL,16,Fhas to visit an ED again.
OL,18,FHe said: "Something going on, somebody
OL,19,Fgoing past, some ding dong or noise.
OL,20,FAll I really wanted at that point was
OL,21,Fto lie down in a bed.
