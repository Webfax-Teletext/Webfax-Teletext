OL,6,FFormer Northern Ireland secretary Sir
OL,7,FBrandon Lewis said he feared the
OL,8,FStormont Executive could collapse in
OL,9,Fautumn 2020, as tensions rose between

OL,11,FCovid restrictions.

OL,15,Fbeen surprised when the Irish
OL,16,FGovernment shut schools in the early
OL,17,Fmonths of the pandemic, just a day
OL,18,Fafter he had had a conversation with
OL,19,Fthe country's deputy premier about the
OL,20,Fneed for consistent messaging across

OL,6,FThe Stormont powersharing institutions

OL,8,Ffollowing a three-year collapse.
OL,10,FBut the new Executive found itself

OL,13,Fintroducing a series of restrictions

OL,16,FIn November, during a series of

OL,6,FSir Brandon, who was secretary of

OL,8,Fbecome frustrated with each other.
OL,10,FHe told the inquiry: "I do remember
OL,11,Fduring that period being concerned
OL,12,Fthat I could see the Executive
OL,13,Fcollapsing again.
OL,15,F"One of the ministers had been talking
