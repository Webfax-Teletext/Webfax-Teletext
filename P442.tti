OL,8,Fpublicly criticised the way the policy

OL,10,FHe suggested had it been a government

OL,12,Fwould have had a say because of the
OL,13,Fparticular sensitives around military
OL,14,Fservice in Northern Ireland.J"But this
OL,15,Fproposal was developed by a political

OL,17,Fcandidates, some of whom are relevant
OL,18,Fministers," he said.JIn a sign of
OL,19,Fwider unease at the policy, he added:
OL,20,F"History has proven time and time
OL,21,Fagain that liberty under law ` not
