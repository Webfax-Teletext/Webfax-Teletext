OL,6,FThe court heard that the post about

OL,8,Fwas headed 'terrorist alert' and said
OL,9,FCouncillor Senoi Barr would be removed
OL,10,Ffrom the city 'dead or alive'.
OL,12,FHe was interviewed by police on May 5
OL,13,Fand responded that 'everyone leaves

OL,6,FDefence counsel Michael Donaghey said

OL,12,FHe said the messages were posted on
