OL,6,FIn a wide-ranging interview with the

OL,9,Fdeparture as party leader.
OL,11,FSir Jeffrey quit on Good Friday after
OL,12,Fbeing charged with historical sexual
OL,13,Foffences. He has said he will
OL,14,Fstrenuously contest the charges.
OL,16,FThe charges brought about his shock
OL,17,Fresignation of the leadership of the
OL,18,Flargest party in unionism, with party
OL,19,Fdeputy leader Mr Robinson's assumption
OL,20,Fof interim leadership. The party also
OL,21,Fsuspended Sir Jeffrey's membership.
