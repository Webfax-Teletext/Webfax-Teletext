OL,5,FIn his findings, Mr Justice Humphreys,
OL,6,Fwho is also a High Court judge, said
OL,7,Fthat the use of force in the ambush
OL,8,Fwas not justified and that the
OL,9,Fsoldiers did not have an honest belief
OL,10,Fthat it was necessary in order to
OL,11,Fprevent loss of life.
OL,13,FHe also said the use of force by the
OL,14,Fsoldiers was, in the circumstances
OL,15,Fthey believed them to be, "not
OL,16,Freasonable".

OL,5,FThe judge was also critical of the
OL,6,Foperation, saying it was not planned
OL,7,Fand controlled in a way to minimise to
OL,8,Fthe "greatest extent possible" the
OL,9,Fneed to use lethal force.
OL,11,FHe also rejected the soldiers' claims
OL,12,Fthat the IRA members opened fire in
OL,13,Fthe car park, saying they were
OL,14,F"demonstrably untrue".
OL,16,FMr Justice Humphreys went on to say
OL,17,Fthat reports created by the police
OL,18,Fforce in the aftermath, including
OL,19,Fthose provided to government
OL,20,Fministers, referred to simultaneous
