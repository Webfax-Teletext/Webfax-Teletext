OL,6,FGerry Adams winning his libel case
OL,7,Fagainst the BBC is "bound to have a

OL,12,FJoshua Rosenburg, a legal commentator
OL,13,Fwho worked at the BBC for more than 20
OL,14,Fyears, said Mr Adams' success will
OL,15,F"make people think twice about
OL,16,Fdefending cases... It will make people

OL,14,F"They clearly felt they had no option
