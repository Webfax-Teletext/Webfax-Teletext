OL,3,CStormont deal has not removed Irish
OL,4,CSea border, says ex-attorney general
OL,6,FKey among the questions he was asked
OL,7,Fwas whether the plan set out in the
OL,8,FSafeguarding The Union command paper
OL,9,Fwould restore the 1800 Acts of Union;
OL,10,Fwhether they removed a customs and
OL,11,Fregulatory border in the Irish Sea;
OL,12,Fand do they ensure "zero checks and
OL,13,Fzero paperwork" for GB goods destined
OL,14,Ffor Northern Ireland.
OL,16,FMr Larkin argued that they achieved
OL,17,Fnone of those objectives.
