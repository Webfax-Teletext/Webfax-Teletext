OL,6,FIt has been three years since the
OL,7,Fintroduction of the Bristol Clean Air
OL,8,FZone however opinions on wether it has
OL,9,Fbeen a success are still divided.
OL,11,FThe Clean Air Zone covers a large area
OL,12,Faround the city centre. Drivers of
OL,13,Fparticularly polluting vehicles have
OL,14,Fto pay #9 a day to Bristol City
OL,15,FCouncil to enter the zone, which the
OL,16,Fcouncil says is then spent on
OL,17,Fproviding more sustainable forms of
OL,18,Ftransport like putting on new bus
OL,19,Fservices.
