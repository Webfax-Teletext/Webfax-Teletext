OL,6,FThe dolphin - which measured 1.4

OL,10,FA dolphin which was found dead nearby,
OL,11,Fwas thought to be the youngster's mum.
OL,13,FFirst aid was administered and it was
OL,14,Fdecided the young dolphin was strong
OL,15,Fenough to cope without its mum.
OL,17,FA refloat was planned, but it became

OL,19,Frefloated in the location it was found
OL,20,Fin, because of the incoming tide.

OL,6,FThe dolphin and the team working with
