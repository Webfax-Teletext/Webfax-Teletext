OL,9,FEarlier this month, Reform UK achieved
OL,10,Fa stunning result in Cornwall
OL,11,FCouncil's local election. The party
OL,12,Fcomfortably won the popular vote and
OL,13,Fsaw 28 of its candidates elected to
OL,14,FLys Kernow.
OL,16,FFrom Camborne and Fowey to Liskeard
OL,17,Fand Saltash, Reform went from a
OL,18,Fstanding start - they had never before
OL,19,Fhad a single councillor elected here -
OL,20,Fto finding themselves the largest
OL,21,Fparty in Cornwall.
