OL,6,FHe said: "I wasn't really sure what I

OL,9,Fdidn't know if it was injured.
OL,11,F"He was running around fairly freely
OL,12,Fso I wasn't concerned about injuries
OL,13,Fbut I needed to get him out the bowl.
OL,15,F"I'd brought this big heavy curtain in
OL,16,Fcase I thought I was going to have to

OL,18,Fthing in there with him.

OL,6,FDave has been volunteering with the
OL,7,Fgroup for several years but says this
OL,8,Fis the first time he's ever had to
OL,9,Frescue a badger from the skate park.
OL,11,FHis advice is that people should seek
OL,12,Fhelp and call the appropriate
OL,13,Fauthorities if they see an animal
OL,14,Fstuck.
OL,16,F"They don't really enjoy human
OL,17,Fcompany, like all wild animals he'll
OL,18,Falways be looking to get away", he
OL,19,Fsaid.

OL,6,F"It's OK as long as I didn't corner

OL,10,F"With any trapped animal it's always
OL,11,Fbest to get somebody with experience
OL,12,Fto help.
OL,14,F"They can sometimes be more aggressive
