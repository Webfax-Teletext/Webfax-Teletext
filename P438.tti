OL,8,FA dairy farmer from Cornwall fears 200
OL,9,Fyears of family farming may "come to
OL,10,Fan end", following proposed changes to

OL,13,FThe Dark family has farmed for nearly
OL,14,Ftwo centuries, and since 1988 they
OL,15,Fhave been based at Trudnoe Farm in
OL,16,FMullion, near Helston.
OL,18,FThe farm is currently run by Stephen
OL,19,FDark and his brother, who told ITV
OL,20,FNews he's proud of its heritage and
OL,21,Fbusiness.

OL,6,FThe farm spans 277 acres and has a
OL,7,Fherd of 235 cows. It supplies Rodda's
OL,8,Fwith cream and liquid milk, producing
OL,9,Fmore than 2.5 million litres a year.

OL,12,Fannounced that from 2026, farmers

OL,6,F"I know there's been the argument that
OL,7,Ffarmers are asset rich, but the
OL,8,Freturns that we've been receiving over

OL,10,Fthere's not enough profit created to
