OL,6,FA new species of sea slug has been
OL,7,Fdiscovered off the West Country coast,
OL,8,Fexperts say.
OL,10,FThe creature, whose scientific name is
OL,11,FPleurobranchaea britannica, was
OL,12,Fidentified by scientists from the
OL,13,FCentre for Environment, Food and
OL,14,FAquaculture Science (CEFAS) and the
OL,15,FUniversity of Cadiz, Spain.
OL,17,FIt was collected during routine
OL,18,Ffishery surveys conducted by CEFAS and
OL,19,Fthe Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia
OL,20,Fin 2018 and 2019 off England and in
OL,21,Fthe Gulf of Cadiz.

OL,6,FMarine biologists initially believed
OL,7,Fthe small, shell-less sea mollusc to
OL,8,Fbe a Pleurobranchaea meckeli, due to
OL,9,Fthe distinctive side-gill on the right-

OL,12,FThese are typically found from
