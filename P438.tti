OL,6,FAn Exmouth family are fighting to save
OL,7,Fa beloved oak tree which insurers say
OL,8,Fmust be felled because it's causing
OL,9,Fsubsidence at the property it's on.
OL,11,FLinda and Scott Taylor Cantrill who
OL,12,Fown the 200 year-old tree say it's
OL,13,Fvalued by the community and an
OL,14,Fimportant part of their family -
OL,15,Fespecially their 11 year old son Redd
OL,16,Fwho has complex disabilities.
OL,18,FHe has epilepsy and visual and hearing
OL,19,Fimpairments which they say are helped
OL,20,Fby the tree in theirJgarden.
