OL,5,FCornwall Council is appealing for
OL,6,Finformation about the dogs, which do
OL,7,Fnot have microchips or ID tags.
OL,9,FIt is thought they could all have the
OL,10,Fsame owner.
OL,12,FCornwall Council's dog welfare
OL,13,Fofficer, Adrian Fitzgerald., said:
OL,14,F"They were in reasonable condition,
OL,15,Fthey were all bitches which obviously
OL,16,Fraises suspicions, clearly from some
OL,17,Fsort of working background.
OL,19,F"They were a little bit underweight
OL,20,Fbut then working dogs do struggle to
OL,21,Fput on weight.

OL,5,F"Although they are two separate
OL,6,Fgroups, it is our belief that they are
OL,7,Fpart and parcel of the same owner,
OL,8,Fthey've come from the same area."
OL,10,FThe dogs do not have identity tags or
OL,11,Fup to date microchips, so it's not yet
OL,12,Fclear where they came from. They will
OL,13,Fbe kept under the council's care for

OL,16,FSarah-Jane Brown, the council's
OL,17,Fcommunity protection leader, said:
OL,18,F"Unfortunately more and more we are
