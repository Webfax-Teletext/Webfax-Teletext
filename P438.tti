OL,6,FSt Mary Redcliffe Church in Bristol is
OL,7,Fhoping to host its first heavy metal
OL,8,Fconcert at the beginning of 2025.
OL,10,FThe idea started last August when doom
OL,11,Fmetal bands, Pantheist and Ard,
OL,12,Fperformed with David Pipe, the
OL,13,Fcathedral organist at the Diocese of
OL,14,FLeeds, at Huddersfield Town Hall.
OL,16,FThe performance was featured on Radio
OL,17,F4's Sunday Worship which prompted
OL,18,Fdozens of churches to explore the idea
OL,19,Fof pairing heavy metal with a pipe
OL,20,Forgan.

OL,11,FHe said: "We're looking at

OL,13,FWe're always thinking, how can we
OL,14,Freflect what Bristol looks and sounds
OL,15,Flike today.
OL,17,F"Bristol is becoming more and more a
OL,18,Fsecular city. Bringing new people into
OL,19,Fthe church to hear the organ in a new
OL,20,Fand exciting way is something I'm
OL,21,Freally keen to do."

OL,6,FMr Cryan added that the organ at St
OL,7,FMary Redcliffe was famous around the
OL,8,Fworld.
OL,10,F"Handel played it and Howells. We have
OL,11,Fa history of big musical players using
OL,12,Four organ to structure how music can
OL,13,Fsound in the Church. So why not think
OL,14,Fof it in different ways?"
OL,16,FAccording to the church's records, the
OL,17,Ffamous composer Handel was friends
OL,18,Fwith the Vicar of St Mary Redcliffe,
OL,19,FThomas Broughton, in the 1700s.

OL,8,Ffitted in the church at that time -
OL,9,Fsome of whose surviving pipework was
OL,10,Fincorporated into the modern organ.
OL,12,FOf course, the idea of playing heavy

OL,16,FIn February, Canterbury Cathedral had
