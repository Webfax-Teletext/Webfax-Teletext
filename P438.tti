OL,6,FIt is the second time a minibus has
OL,7,Fbeen stolen from the charity in less
OL,8,Fthan seven months.
OL,10,FSue England, business manager at
OL,11,FSunflowers at Grafton, said she
OL,12,F"couldn't believe" it had happened
OL,13,Fagain.
OL,15,F"It just felt very surreal," she said.
OL,16,F"I just thought, 'how can this be
OL,17,Fhappening again?' So many people have
OL,18,Fsaid, it is quite clearly a children's
OL,19,Fminibus, and then you think, what sort
OL,20,Fof people would do that?"

OL,6,FSunflowers at Grafton is a not-for-
OL,7,Fprofit charity that works with more
OL,8,Fthan 150 families.
OL,10,FMs England said the minibuses provide
OL,11,Fa "vital" service, transporting
OL,12,Fchildren to and from school.
OL,14,FShe explained: "We're all about
OL,15,Fchildcare, home from home, and we're
OL,16,Fvery much an extension of home for
OL,17,Fthese children and their parents.
OL,19,F"So it's really hard for us to think,
OL,20,Fhow are we going to keep these
OL,21,Fservices going?"

OL,6,FThe charity is now working to find a
OL,7,Fsolution so that the service can
OL,8,Fcontinue when children return to

OL,11,F"We've got a lot of work to do to
OL,12,Fthink about the implications of it,
OL,13,Fand how we now, find two replacement
OL,14,Fbuses," Ms England explained. "We've
OL,15,Fhad those buses for a while, and costs
OL,16,Fhave gone up massively."
OL,18,F"We're just devastated really," she
OL,19,Fsaid. "We will manage through it, but
OL,20,Fit's just such a waste of energy that
OL,21,Fcould be spent on something positive."
