OL,10,Feverybody to say how it fits in, it
OL,11,Fmeans so much to me. It really does

OL,17,Fshow me the order of service from

OL,6,FThe wings at the Stone Circle are not
OL,7,FEdgar's first at Glastonbury. In 2017,
OL,8,FEmily Eavis commissioned him to
OL,9,Fproduce a pair for The Park.
OL,11,FSince then he has added two more to
OL,12,Ftheir ranks, as well as those in the
OL,13,FPeace Garden, making four pairs on
OL,14,FWorthy Farm in total.
OL,16,FBut just over a decade ago all of this
OL,17,Fwould have seemed impossible to Edgar.

OL,8,Falso struggling with addiction,

OL,10,Ftake his own life.
OL,12,F"I was going to hang myself, when I

OL,14,Fthis?'
OL,16,F"When I closed my eyes back then, it

OL,20,Fwings, out of nowhere.

OL,6,F"My head snapped up and I realised

OL,11,FOver the following two years, he

OL,13,Fwith three others which went on

OL,11,F"I was sitting in The Park in front of
