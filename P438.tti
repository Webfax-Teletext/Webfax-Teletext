OL,6,FTwenty years ago today Boscastle and
OL,7,FCrackington Haven faced some of the
OL,8,Fmost extreme flash flooding in the
OL,9,FBritish Isles in recent memory.
OL,11,FNearly a month's worth of rain fell in
OL,12,Fa single afternoon and led to a major
OL,13,Flife-saving response from the
OL,14,Femergency services.
OL,16,FNobody lost their lives in the floods
OL,17,Fthat day that is something everyone in
OL,18,Fthis community still cannot believe to
OL,19,Fthis day.

OL,6,FCarole Talboys worked in Boscastle's
OL,7,FWitchcraft museum and was working a
OL,8,Fbusy Monday shift when tourists piled
OL,9,Fin at lunchtime to avoid the rain.
OL,11,FAs it started to build, Carole says
OL,12,Fthe noise coming from the river
OL,13,Fsounded like a "boiling kettle" or
OL,14,F"machinery". The rising tides scared
