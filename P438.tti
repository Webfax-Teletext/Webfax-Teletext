OL,6,FA seal sanctuary in Cornwall is

OL,11,FThe seal, named Sheba, has lived at
OL,12,Fthe Cornish Seal Sanctuary for most of
OL,13,Fher life, after she was rescued as an
OL,14,Finjured pup in 1974.
OL,16,FMost seals live to be around 25 to 30
OL,17,Fyears old in the wild. Typically,
OL,18,Ffemale grey seals in human care can
OL,19,Flive close to 40 years; male seals
OL,20,Flive about 30 years.
