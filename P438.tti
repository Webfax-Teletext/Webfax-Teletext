OL,6,FChair of the Dairy Show, David Cotton,
OL,7,Fsaid for farmers, the event is an
OL,8,Fimportant date in the calendar.
OL,10,F"Many of the farmers have done a day's
OL,11,Fwork before they get here, so they
OL,12,Fdon't arrive until around 10 o'clock.
OL,14,F"By around 3 o'clock it starts to get
OL,15,Fquieter because they've got more work
OL,16,Fto do, so the middle of the day is a
OL,17,Fgood chance to see mates, do a bit of
OL,18,Fbusiness and catch up with each other."
