OL,6,FIt has been 10 years since devastating
OL,7,Ffloods hit the Somerset Levels, when
OL,8,Fhomes and thousands of acres of
OL,9,Ffarmland languished under water for
OL,10,Fweeks.JThe Environment Agency says the
OL,11,Fcounty is more prepared and resilient
OL,12,Fcompared to 2014, but residents are
OL,13,Fconcerned that climate change could
OL,14,Fhave a big impact in the future.
OL,16,FJames Winslade, a farmer who was
OL,17,Fimpacted by the floods back in 2014,
OL,18,Fsaid: "It's weird, it doesn't really

OL,6,FHe said: "I think the risk is, unless

OL,8,Fwe are going to get drainage systems
