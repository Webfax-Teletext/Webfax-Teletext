OL,6,FIt follows Thatchers originally having
OL,7,Ftheir case dismissed at the High Court
OL,8,Flast January. Judge Melissa Clarke
OL,9,Fthere concluded there was a low degree
OL,10,Fof similarity between the products and
OL,11,Fno likelihood of confusion for
OL,12,Fconsumers - something that Thatchers
OL,13,Fthen appealed.
OL,15,FSpeaking on Monday, Lord Justice
OL,16,FArnold said that the Aldi cider's sign
OL,17,Fand graphics on its cans had infringed
OL,18,FThatcher's trademark.

OL,6,FArnold said: "In my judgement, it is
OL,7,Fplain from a comparison between the
OL,8,Fsign and the trademark that the former
OL,9,Fclosely resembles the latter."
OL,11,FHe added: "The inescapable conclusion
OL,12,Fis that Aldi intended the sign to
OL,13,Fremind consumers of the trademark.
OL,15,F"This can only have been in order to
OL,16,Fconvey the message that the Aldi
OL,17,Fproduct was like the Thatchers
OL,18,Fproduct, only cheaper.

OL,6,FArnold said that Aldi was able to
OL,7,Fachieve "substantial sales" of the
OL,8,Fcider in a short period of time
OL,9,F"without spending a penny on promoting
OL,10,Fit" and thus it could be interpreted

OL,17,Finfringed the trademark in terms of
OL,18,Fthe product itself.
