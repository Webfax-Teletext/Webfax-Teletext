OL,6,FCarolyn Custerson, from English

OL,8,Fweekend in June we are going to see
OL,9,Fprobably the best airshow we have ever
OL,10,Fhad. Everybody has taken up the
OL,11,Fchallenge."
OL,13,FImmediately after the 2023 airshow,
OL,14,Fthe council raised doubts about
OL,15,Fwhether it could go on funding the
OL,16,Fevent.
OL,18,FIt costs #250,000 to run the show each
OL,19,Fyear, although it is claimed that for
OL,20,Fevery pound spent on the event #15
OL,21,Fcomes into the local economy.
