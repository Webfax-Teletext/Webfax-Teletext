OL,11,FCeri Morris, a senior midwife at the

OL,15,Fbetter when they're side by side.
OL,17,F"It's really nice that people

OL,19,Fdoesn't just end when we discharge
OL,20,Fthem. We're still remembering you and
OL,21,Fyour loss."

OL,6,FQuinn Irish was only 12-years-old when
OL,7,Fhe died in December 2022. He suffered
OL,8,Fbrain damage as a baby after
OL,9,Fcontracting a common virus, leaving
OL,10,Fhim with profound learning
OL,11,Fdifficulties and complex medical needs.
OL,13,FDavid Irish, Quinn's father, said:
OL,14,F"There's a certain amount of trauma
OL,15,Fthat comes out, massive grief and
OL,16,Fquestioning. But events like this help
OL,17,Fyou to start to manage that.
OL,19,F"You don't deal with it but you learn
OL,20,Fto live with it. It's emotional but
OL,21,Fit's also Quinn still being with us."

OL,6,FQuinn's mother, Lydia, said: "However

OL,8,Ffor family, so it's going to be a time
OL,9,Fwhen people we've lost, are remembered.
OL,11,F"So it feels really appropriate and
OL,12,Fpoignant that there is a seasonal
OL,13,Fevent where we can come together and
