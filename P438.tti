OL,6,FPaul Thomas, who is Fowey's

OL,8,FCountry: "We were alerted when we had
OL,9,Fa report of a van entering the water
OL,10,Fnear the Bodinnick Ferry.
OL,12,F"Clearly that's a very serious
OL,13,Fincident, so we mobilised very quickly.
OL,15,F"We actually had one of our patrol
OL,16,Fboats on the water and he was able to
OL,17,Frespond very quickly, got to the scene
OL,18,Fand managed to recover the driver of a
OL,19,Fvan who had sunk in his van and
OL,20,Fmanaged to escape.

OL,10,Fthere was no pollution risk to the

OL,12,Fcould be a risk to navigation."
OL,14,FMr Thomas continued: "We're blessed in

OL,16,Ftraining around the corner. So they
OL,17,Fwere able to respond immediately,
