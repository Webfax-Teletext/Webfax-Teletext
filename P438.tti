OL,13,FAnd the day itself came with its own
OL,14,Fset of challenges - playing on grass
OL,15,Fusing a wheelchair.
OL,17,FShe said: "It's like Christmas day
OL,18,Fplaying on a hard court. I'll never
OL,19,Ffeel so grateful for playing on a hard
OL,20,Fcourt again. It's about five times
OL,21,Fharder."
