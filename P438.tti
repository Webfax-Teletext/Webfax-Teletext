OL,11,FThe high-tech bands will be given out

OL,16,FThe wristbands were first launched by

OL,18,FSince then, Bristol-based Kate Gilmore
OL,19,Fhas used the scheme to help look after

OL,6,FOne day John left the house and became
OL,7,Fdisorientated. Kate had just
OL,8,Fregistered him with the yellow tag and
OL,9,Fwristband scheme which meant his
OL,10,Finformation was shared with the
OL,11,Fpolice. They had his details when he
OL,12,Fwas found.
OL,14,FKate said: "Two members of the public
OL,15,Fhad seen John looking confused and I'd
OL,16,Freally like to thank those two people
OL,17,F- I don't know who they were, but if
OL,18,Fyou're watching, thank you very much.

OL,10,FThe wristbands are equipped with a
