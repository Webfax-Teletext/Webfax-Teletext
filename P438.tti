OL,11,Ffrom Daniel Bowden, who experienced

OL,13,Fwas visited by Mr Rawle, who worked
OL,14,Ffor Devon County Council.
OL,16,FMr Bowden said: "He was aggressive, he
OL,17,Fsmelt of alcohol, he was constantly in
OL,18,Fmy face. We offered him a cup of
OL,19,Fcoffee out of consideration because he
OL,20,Fdidn't seem right. I didn't know what
OL,21,Fwas wrong with him."
