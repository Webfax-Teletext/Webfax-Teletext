OL,14,F115mm of rain to Dartmoor, and gave
OL,15,Fnew 24-hour January rainfall records

OL,7,FWe've had extensive flooding across
OL,8,FDevon and Somerset, and with little
OL,9,Frespite there's not much chance for
OL,10,Fwater levels to reduce quickly.
OL,12,FSo far this month we've had a third
OL,13,Fmore rainfall than average, and Dorset
OL,14,Fis on track for their second wettest
OL,15,FJanuary on record.
OL,17,FThere's a small window of drier
OL,18,Fweather into Thursday, but then
OL,19,Fthere's more rain on the way for
OL,20,FThursday afternoon with a warning in
OL,21,Fplace.
