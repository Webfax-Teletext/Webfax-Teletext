OL,10,FWhere did the parasite come from?
OL,12,FSouth West Water said in a statement
OL,13,Fon Sunday 19 May: "We have already

OL,15,FHillhead - a damaged air valve on
OL,16,Fprivate farmland - and are urgently
OL,17,Finvestigating how this happened."
OL,19,FEarlier this week, it was suggested
OL,20,Fthat the parasite itself could have
OL,21,Fcome from cow manure on the farmland.
