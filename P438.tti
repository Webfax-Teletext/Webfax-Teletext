OL,6,FThe owner of a Cornish holiday park
OL,7,Fsays he feels 'victimised' by the
OL,8,Fcurrent Labour government due to
OL,9,Fchanges in Business Property Relief
OL,10,Fand Inheritance Tax.
OL,12,FAndrew Baragwanath, who owns Ayr
OL,13,FHoliday Parksays, says the changes
OL,14,Fcould cost him around 1 million pounds
OL,15,Fin what he calls a 'tax grab' by the
OL,16,Fgovernment.
OL,18,FThe changes have led him to consider
OL,19,Fholding off on new investment in the
OL,20,Fbusiness and to not replace employees
OL,21,Fwho leave.
