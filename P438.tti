OL,8,Finfected water crisis
OL,10,FThe town of Brixham in South Devon is
OL,11,Fpeaceful, picturesque and welcoming.
OL,12,FBut for six sun-drenched weeks in the
OL,13,Fsummer of 2024, there was only one
OL,14,Fsubject on everybody's minds - water.
OL,16,FWhen the news broke on 13 May about a
OL,17,Fpotential public health scare, it
OL,18,Fwasn't initially clear what exactly
OL,19,Fthe town was dealing with.

OL,8,Fof the public were advised to boil
OL,9,Ftheir tap water before drinking it. An

OL,14,FDeepening crisis
OL,16,FThe more time went on, the more the

OL,19,Fwere closed and car parks
