OL,13,Ftwice a day during the festival, at
OL,14,F6am and 6pm. But hot air balloons need

OL,6,FThe first mass ascent of the 2024
OL,7,Ffiesta had to be cancelled due to
OL,8,Fwindy conditions, but organisers say
OL,9,F"much calmer winds" are on their way
OL,10,Fwhich looks promising for later
OL,11,Fascents.
OL,13,FPete Dalby is the chairman of the
OL,14,Ffiesta's flying committee. The
OL,15,Fcommittee is in charge of deciding
OL,16,Fwhether the balloons go up for the
OL,17,Fmass ascents.
OL,19,FIt was Pete who made the final
OL,20,Fdecision that this morning's ascent
OL,21,Fcould not happen.

OL,10,FPete said that while conditions can
OL,11,Fseem perfect on the ground, there is a

OL,15,F"It's not always just the wind," he

OL,18,Fthere's other reasons why we can't fly.
