OL,6,FIn a separate statement the firm's

OL,11,Frespecting the landlord's potential

OL,14,FHe confirmed Motion Events had an
OL,15,Fopportunity to buy the venue - but
OL,16,Fonly "if it were not used as a going
OL,17,Fconcern". This type of sale would have
OL,18,Fenabled Motion to continue running as

OL,6,FMr Deeks said the firm created a
OL,7,F"detailed plan" to "maximise" the sale
OL,8,Fvalue for the landlord and develop the
OL,9,Fsite to add creative spaces above the
OL,10,Fmain venue. He said these plans were
OL,11,Fsupported by Bristol City Council,
OL,12,Fwhich recognises Motion as an
OL,13,Fimportant cultural space and an
OL,14,Feconomic asset for the city.
OL,16,FHowever he said that the "pressures
OL,17,Fand limitations" surrounding the
OL,18,Fbuilding and its potential development
OL,19,Fhave brought it to the point where
OL,20,FMotion will close in July 2025.
