OL,6,FThe law firm, Leigh Day, has taken
OL,7,Flegal action on Avara Foods Limited, a
OL,8,Fleading food producer in the UK, over
OL,9,Fallegations it has caused severe
OL,10,Fpollution in the River Wye and its
OL,11,Fsurrounding areas, through its chicken

OL,13,Fthat Avara Foods' activities have been
OL,14,Fthe main source of phosphorous
OL,15,Fpollution in the River Wye, leading to
OL,16,Fthe river's significant degradation.
OL,18,FThe firm argues that Avara Foods
OL,19,Fshould not only stop its polluting

OL,21,Fand compensate those impacted.
