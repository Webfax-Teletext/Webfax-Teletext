OL,6,FMany of those who can remember Victory
OL,7,Fin Europe Day were children at the
OL,8,Ftime. The war had taken a large chunk
OL,9,Fof their childhoods, and they knew
OL,10,Flittle else.
OL,12,FJoan Herring and Mary Beresford were
OL,13,Fin their early teens on VE Day. They
OL,14,Fboth now live in a care home in Quorn,
OL,15,Fin Leicestershire, but can vividly
OL,16,Frecall where they were, and what they
OL,17,Fwere doing, when the war finally ended.

OL,6,FJoan was 15 and on her way to get her
OL,7,Fphotograph taken in a studio with a
OL,8,Ffriend when news broke that the war
OL,9,Fhad ended.
OL,11,FShe said: "We got off the bus to go
OL,12,Fand have out photograph taken and
OL,13,Fpeople were going mad. They were
OL,14,Frunning in and out of shops, shouting
OL,15,Fand just standing there and shouting.
OL,17,F"We were absolutely amazed. I hadn't

OL,20,Four photographs taken and went home.

OL,6,F"This has all come to an end. What
OL,7,Fwould the world be like without a war?"
OL,9,FMary's first thoughts when she heard
OL,10,Fwar had ended were about her brother
OL,11,Fwho was serving overseas.
OL,13,FShe said: "He was training to be a

OL,10,FShe said: "We went up the Mall to

OL,14,F"There were people up lampposts, there

OL,6,F"It was just general excitement.
OL,7,FNobody was doing anything logical, it
OL,8,Fwas just mad. Anyway we stayed around
OL,9,Ffor quite a while, we saw the Royal

OL,12,F"I remember thinking isn't it funny
