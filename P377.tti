OL,7,FMr Newbury said he had not reported

OL,9,Fguilty afterwards, so wanted to stop
OL,10,Fthe silence and "shame" experienced by
OL,11,Fthose who have been assaulted.
OL,13,F'It's a complete blank'
OL,15,FMr Newbury said: "Around 10 years ago,
OL,16,FI went on a night out in an unfamiliar
OL,17,Fcity with a group of friends. I was
OL,18,Fvery conscious not to overdo it,
OL,19,Fbecause if I got separated from the

OL,21,Fway back to the hotel.
