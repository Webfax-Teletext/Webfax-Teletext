OL,6,FVisitors to Mary Stevens Park in
OL,7,FStourbridge are being told to not be
OL,8,Falarmed about the pools' water
OL,9,Fappearing a turquoise blue colour.
OL,11,FThe warm weather has been blamed for
OL,12,Fthe growth of algae which reduces
OL,13,Foxygen levels in the water.
OL,15,FSpecialists have been treating the
OL,16,Fpool in the hope of saving the lives
OL,17,Fof thousands of fish.
OL,19,FThe blue colour should reflect more of
OL,20,Fthe sunlight and improve the levels of
OL,21,Foxygen.

OL,7,FCllr Damian Corfield
OL,8,Fsaid:"Exceptionally sunny and warm
OL,9,Fperiods result in sunlight penetrating
OL,10,Fthe water and increasing algae growth.
OL,12,F"Algae reduces oxygen levels in the
OL,13,Fpool and can be harmful to fish and
OL,14,Fgeneral water quality, so we have had
OL,15,Fto take action.
OL,17,F"Visitors to the park will notice the
OL,18,Fpool to have a blue appearance, but I
OL,19,Fwould urge them not to be alarmed by
OL,20,Fthis.
