OL,6,FAfter initial resistance, the

OL,8,Finquiry into the pervasive issue of
OL,9,Fchild grooming gangs.
OL,11,FThis decision comes in the wake of
OL,12,FBaroness Casey's scathing review of
OL,13,Fchild sexual exploitation, which
OL,14,Fexposed decades of systemic failures
OL,15,Fin identifying perpetrators and
OL,16,Fdelivering justice.
OL,18,FTragically, many young female victims
OL,19,Fwere often dismissed and even
OL,20,Fcriminalised themselves.

OL,6,FThe horrifying extent of this scandal
OL,7,Ffirst came to light in the Midlands in
OL,8,F2010. In Derby, nine men were
OL,9,Fincarcerated for rape and sexual
OL,10,Fassault, with 26 victims, some as
OL,11,Fyoung as 13. Even more shocking,
OL,12,Finvestigations in Telford revealed
OL,13,Fthat over a thousand girls had been
OL,14,Fsexually exploited over several
OL,15,Fdecades.
OL,17,FThese girls were frequently lured into
OL,18,Ftaxis late at night, given treats and
OL,19,Falcohol, and then assaulted and passed
OL,20,Famong group members.
