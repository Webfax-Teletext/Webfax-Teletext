OL,6,FIt comes after Gordon said earlier in
OL,7,Fthe trial atthat he was "not the
OL,8,Fkiller" and that Carpenter had
OL,9,Fadmitted during a conversation in a

OL,11,FCody Fisher and left the knife at the
OL,12,Fscene.
OL,14,FProsecutors allege Gordon, Carpenter
OL,15,Fand a third defendant, Reegan

OL,14,FCarpenter said to the jury: "Remy is
