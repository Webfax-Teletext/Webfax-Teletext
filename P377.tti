OL,7,FMr Miller's family moved into their
OL,8,F1950s home in August 2024 and he said
OL,9,Fthe previous owners had told them
OL,10,Fthere was something metallic at the
OL,11,Fbottom of the garden, which they
OL,12,Fbelieved to be a pump or part of the

OL,15,F"I went over with the mower and it
OL,16,Fexposed something metallic," the 48-
OL,17,Fyear-old software engineer said.
OL,19,F"I had a quick look at it, brushed it
OL,20,Fand thought 'this doesn't look like a
OL,21,Fpump'.
