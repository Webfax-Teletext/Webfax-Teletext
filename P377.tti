OL,6,FWhat did the report say?
OL,8,FThe 302 report, published today,
OL,9,Fidentified a series of failings by the
OL,10,Ftrust including that the killer was
OL,11,Fnot forced to take long- lasting anti-
OL,12,Fpsychotic medication because he
OL,13,Fdisliked needles.
OL,15,FIt also found that Calocane's care
OL,16,Frisk "was not fully understood,
OL,17,Fmanaged, documented or communicated"
OL,18,Fand that there were missed
OL,19,Fopportunities to take more assertive
