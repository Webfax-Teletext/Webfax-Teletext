OL,12,FBirmingham City Council has recently
OL,13,Fsecured almost #50,000 to combat the

OL,15,FThe money comes from a government

OL,20,Ffixed penalty notice (FPN) of #150 is
OL,21,Fgiven to those caught littering, which
OL,22,Ffor fly-tipping can increase to
OL,23,F#50,000 and potentially imprisonment
OL,24,Fif someone refuses to pay.
