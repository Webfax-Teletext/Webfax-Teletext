OL,14,Fthey could see where they were going
OL,15,Fand I couldn't? My friend could see
OL,16,Fthe stars and all I saw was
OL,17,Fblackness. Or wandering around at
OL,18,Fnighttime and it was pitch black for
OL,19,Fme but my friends could see where
OL,20,Fthey were going. It baffled me.
