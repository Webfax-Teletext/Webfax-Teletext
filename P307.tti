OL,7,Fstained glass window fragments which
OL,8,Fwere anonymously returned to a
OL,9,Fhistoric abbey several years ago.
OL,11,FThe 49 fragments were sent to the
OL,12,FAbbey Church, part of 950-year-old
OL,13,FDunfermline Abbey, in a box marked for
OL,14,Fthe attention of "Bob Brewse" in
OL,15,FNovember 2020.
OL,17,FThe shards had been discovered beside
OL,18,Fthe abbey 20 years previously and
OL,19,Fremoved by the person who sent the box.
