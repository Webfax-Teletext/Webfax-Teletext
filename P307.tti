OL,7,FIn Thursday's speech, he went on to
OL,8,Fsay the review's findings meant a
OL,9,F"head" must "roll", and his position
OL,10,Fof responsibility meant it must be
OL,11,Fhis. Welby made a joke that he hoped
OL,12,Fhis head would not "literally" roll.
OL,14,FThe Archbishop also referenced a 14th-
OL,15,Fcentury beheading which prompted
OL,16,Flaughter from some peers.
OL,18,FOn Friday, he said: "I would like to

OL,20,Fthat my speech has caused.
