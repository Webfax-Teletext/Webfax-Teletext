OL,6,FIn 2020, five out of America's 50
OL,7,Fstates changed hands. If Trump had won
OL,8,Fback just three of them, he would have
OL,9,Fbeen president. How could he have done
OL,10,Fthat?
OL,12,FBy winning over just 43,000 votes
OL,13,Facross Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona
OL,14,F- which amount to less than 0.03% of
OL,15,Fthe 150 million votes cast.

OL,6,FThe reason that a tiny handful of

OL,8,Fthe United States is the electoral
OL,9,Fcollege, established in the 18th

OL,11,Fwho wanted the country's president to
OL,12,Fbe elected by a popular vote and those
OL,13,Fwho wanted Congress to decide.
OL,15,FMany believe it is long past its use-
OL,16,Fby-date, but for now, it continues as
OL,17,Fthe system for electing arguably the
OL,18,Fmost powerful politician in the world.
