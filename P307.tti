OL,7,Frecent memory, the UK has been dealt a
OL,8,Fsharp reminder that summer is still
OL,9,Fjust around the corner - and not quite
OL,10,Fhere yet.
OL,12,FOvernight temperatures plummeted to a
OL,13,Fbiting -5C in Altnaharra, Scotland,
OL,14,Fmarking one of the coldest nights for
OL,15,FMay on record.
OL,17,FIt's highly likely this will go down
OL,18,Fas the coldest May 22-23 ever
OL,19,Frecorded, a rare feat in an era when
OL,20,Fcold weather records are increasingly
OL,21,Ffew and far between.
