OL,6,FIn June that year, an optician
OL,7,Fbelieved it to be a rare neurological
OL,8,Fdisorder called Adie pupil, but after
OL,9,Fher pupil grew larger and she began to
OL,10,Fexperience double vision, she was
OL,11,Freferred to Ninewells Hospital in
OL,12,FDundee for a CT scan, and was told it
OL,13,Fwas a tumour.
OL,15,FMs Kerr, of Kinross, said: "My dad
OL,16,Fused to be a medic in the Army and
OL,17,Fjoked he'd only seen this happen on
OL,18,Fthree types of people: someone who had
OL,19,Fa stroke, a drug addict and a dead
