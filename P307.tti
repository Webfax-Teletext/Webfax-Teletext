OL,12,FThe jump in Consumer Prices Index
OL,13,F(CPI) inflation to 3% has taken
OL,14,Fanalysts a little by surprise (it was
OL,15,Fexpected to hit 2.8%). But it may not
OL,16,Fbe quite as bad as it looks.
OL,18,FThe rise in food and non-alcoholic
OL,19,Fdrink inflation to 3.3% is definitely
OL,20,Fconcerning because it hits the poorest
OL,21,Fhouseholds the hardest.

OL,6,FBut the other two big drivers of this
OL,7,Fjump are unlikely to have the same
OL,8,Feffect next month.
OL,10,FOne is airfares - usually those take-
OL,11,Foff dramatically in December and then
OL,12,Fplunge back down again in January.
OL,14,FBut for technical reasons the price
OL,15,Fincrease in December 2024 was nowhere
OL,16,Fnear as pronounced as usual and so the
OL,17,Fsubsequent drop in January 2025 was
OL,18,Falso smaller.

OL,6,FAnother major driver was the VAT which

OL,11,FAlthough some of that effect might

OL,6,FThis pair of unusual features -
OL,7,Fairfares and school fees - means the
OL,8,FBank of England may be less likely to
OL,9,Fhold interest rates higher for longer
OL,10,Fas a result of Wednesday's CPI.
OL,12,FBut let's not get too excited;
OL,13,Finflation is still expected to rise
OL,14,Fthis year (to 3.7% thinks the Bank),
OL,15,Fgrowth is still poor to non-existent
OL,16,Fand we have yet to feel the full
