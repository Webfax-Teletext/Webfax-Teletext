OL,8,FUkraine's President Zelenskyy returned
OL,9,Fto the Oval Office on Monday for a
OL,10,Fnotably warmer meeting with President
OL,11,FTrump, in stark contrast to their
OL,12,Ftense exchange in February.
OL,14,FZelenskyy called the day's talks
OL,15,F"constructive" and "substantial",
OL,16,Fwhile Trump came away saying there was
OL,17,Fa "good chance" that further talks
OL,18,Fwould lead to the end of Russia's war

OL,6,FPresident Zelenskyy last visited the
OL,7,FWhite House in February, where his
OL,8,FOval Office meeting with President
OL,9,FTrump proved so fiery that the
OL,10,FUkrainian delegation were asked to
OL,11,Fleave early.
OL,13,FTrump repeatedly told Zelenskyy that
OL,14,Fhe "does not hold the cards", with the
OL,15,Fpair disagreeing on the immediacy of
OL,16,Fsecurity guarantees.
OL,18,FTrump later accused Zelenskyy of
OL,19,F"gambling with World War Three", with
OL,20,FUS Vice President JD Vance calling him
OL,21,F"disrespectful".
