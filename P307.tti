OL,7,FJason Beer KC drew attention towards
OL,8,FPaula Vennells' witness statement,
OL,9,Fwhich confirms that she received a
OL,10,Freport in 2011 from EY. The report
OL,11,Fidentified a risk that unrestricted
OL,12,Faccess to privileged IT functions in
OL,13,Fthe Horizon system could lead to "the
OL,14,Fprocessing of unauthorised or
OL,15,Ferroneous transactions."
OL,17,FMr Beer said it was implicit in the
OL,18,Fstatement that Fujitsu had remote
OL,19,Faccess to Horizon, asking whether Ms
OL,20,FVennells accepted that.

OL,13,Fout, was false.
