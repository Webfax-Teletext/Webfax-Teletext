OL,4,Cguitarist has died aged 86
OL,6,F"I had a distinctive sound that people
OL,7,Fcould recognize and I stuck pretty
OL,8,Fmuch with that. I'm not one of the
OL,9,Fbest technical players by any means; I
OL,10,Fjust sell the best," he said in a 1986
OL,11,Finterview.
OL,13,F"A lot of guys are more skillful than
OL,14,FI am with the guitar. A lot of it is
OL,15,Fover my head. But some of it is not
OL,16,Fwhat I want to hear out of the guitar."

OL,19,Ffirst album, Have Twangy Guitar Will
OL,20,FTravel, to his 1993 box set, Twang

OL,6,F"It's a silly name for a non-silly
OL,7,Fthing," Eddy said in 1993. "But it has
OL,8,Fhaunted me for 35 years now, so it's
OL,9,Falmost like sentimental value - if
OL,10,Fnothing else."
OL,12,FEddy and producer Lee Hazlewood helped
