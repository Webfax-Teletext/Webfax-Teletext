OL,11,FThe man who would go on to be

OL,6,FFor them, a key moment came in the
OL,7,FAutumn of 2022 at Labour's annual
OL,8,Fconference in Liverpool. It was just
OL,9,Fweeks after the Queen passed away and
OL,10,Fthey knew that it was critical that
OL,11,FLabour marked the moment well.
OL,13,FIt may not have seemed that much to

OL,6,FAn ambassador told me recently that it
