OL,6,FAttorney General Lord Richard Hermer
OL,7,Fhas told a committee of MPs he blamed
OL,8,Fan "out of date" and "not fit for

OL,11,FChina.
OL,13,FSpeaking to the National Security

OL,15,FHermer said he believed prosecutors
OL,16,Fhad worked in "good faith" to secure
OL,17,Fconvictions against Christopher Cash
OL,18,Fand Christopher Berry, but the
OL,19,FOfficial Secrets Act 1911 posed a
