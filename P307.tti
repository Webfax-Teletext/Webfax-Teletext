OL,6,FBig game hunting is an industry in
OL,7,FSouth Africa. ITV News correspondent
OL,8,FGeraint Vincent visited a lion farm to
OL,9,Finvestigate.
OL,11,FI knew lions were hunted for sport in
OL,12,FSouth Africa. I had seen the pictures
OL,13,Fon social media which always caused
OL,14,Fsuch outrage. A magnificent animal
OL,15,Flying lifeless at the feet of a
OL,16,Fsmiling human holding a rifle.
OL,18,FI had always imagined that the lions
OL,19,Fwho met such an end had at least led
OL,20,Ftheir lives wild - in the wide open
OL,21,Fspaces of the African bush.

OL,6,FI was wrong.
OL,8,FBig game hunting in South Africa is an
OL,9,Findustry. The vast majority of lions
OL,10,Fin South Africa live in captivity -
OL,11,Fbred to supply that industry with
OL,12,Ftrophies.
OL,14,FI went to visit a lion farm. The
OL,15,Fanimals - usually one male and two
OL,16,Ffemales - live in large pens. I
OL,17,Fguessed that the largest enclosure was
OL,18,Fno more than 80 metres long. The lions
OL,19,FI saw were used for breeding.

OL,6,FThe cubs are taken and when they grow

OL,11,F$25,000 (nearly #20,000) - to shoot a

OL,6,FThis entirely legal business has
OL,7,Fflourished for decades. But after
OL,8,Fyears of international opprobrium, and
OL,9,Fgrowing domestic protest, the South
OL,10,FAfrican government has agreed that the
OL,11,Fbreeding of lions for sport must come
OL,12,Fto an end.
OL,14,FIt proposes a system of voluntary
