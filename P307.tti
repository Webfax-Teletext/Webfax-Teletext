OL,9,Fthat has continued over whether there
OL,10,Fshould be a change in the law so that
OL,11,Funder 18s who commit such atrocities
OL,12,Fcan receive whole-life sentences
OL,14,FThe murder of three little girls at a
OL,15,FTaylor Swift themed dance class in
OL,16,FSouthport is shocking, distressing,
OL,17,Fsickening and extreme. That is why it

OL,20,Fsentencing - has led to an outcry.

OL,12,FShock at the sentence has triggered a

OL,11,FAlthough the Government could in

OL,11,Fsource put it "international law is a

OL,13,Ftested". They said the right of a
OL,14,Fchild perpetrator has to be balanced
OL,15,Fagainst the rights of a child victim.
OL,17,FBut Kirwan continued: "Of course, we
