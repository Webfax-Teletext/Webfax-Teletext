OL,6,FAfter a strong start to the year, the
OL,7,FUK economy spluttered again in May,
OL,8,Fshrinking by 0.1% from the previous

OL,11,FManufacturing output sagged, along
OL,12,Fwith construction and retail sales.
OL,14,FA year ago, a Labour government was
OL,15,Felected on a promise to revive growth
OL,16,Fand "put more money in people's
OL,17,Fpockets". So far, there's been little
OL,18,Fsign of a turnaround.

OL,7,Feconomy grew by just 0.7% - an anaemic
OL,8,Frate that won't leave many households

OL,11,FTwenty years ago, growth over the same
OL,12,Fperiod was more than three times
OL,13,Fhigher.
OL,15,FThe UK economy has been listless for

OL,20,Fopportunity, the government must find
OL,21,Fa way to break the spell.

OL,6,FIt's easy to be gloomy about the

OL,8,Fagain. Many businesses are absorbing
OL,9,Fhigher taxes (in the form of national

OL,11,Ffailure to deliver its planned

OL,10,FPay has now been rising faster than

OL,17,Fhelp in time.
