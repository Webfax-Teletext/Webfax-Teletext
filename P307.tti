OL,7,FThe annual gathering of leaders at the

OL,9,FYork. Not for the first time it will
OL,10,Fbe dominated by the world's most
OL,11,Fenduring and complex conflict: the
OL,12,FIsraeli-Palestinian question.
OL,14,FThe catastrophe of Gaza, with tens of
OL,15,Fthousands of civilians killed in
OL,16,FIsrael's offensive, has made this UN
OL,17,Fsummit the most anguished for decades.

OL,7,FThe position held by the British

OL,10,Fsimply. The Palestinian people have a

OL,17,Frecognition because hopes of a viable
OL,18,FPalestinian state are being
