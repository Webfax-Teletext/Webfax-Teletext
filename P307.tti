OL,6,FThe Alrfaai family are trying to build
OL,7,Fa new life together in Glasgow. After
OL,8,Fescaping the war in Syria, they were
OL,9,Fgranted asylum in Scotland three years
OL,10,Fago.
OL,12,FBut one person is missing, their
OL,13,Feldest son Mohammed, 21, is now facing
OL,14,Fdeportation to Africa.
OL,16,F"The whole family is suffering. His
OL,17,Fmum and his sisters are all struggling
OL,18,Fto comprehend the fact that he might
OL,19,Fbe moved to Rwanda," Mohammed's father
OL,20,FHisham Alrfaai told ITV News.
