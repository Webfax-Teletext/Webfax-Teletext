OL,6,FAn artificial grass firm has been
OL,7,Fordered to take down a second
OL,8,Fbillboard poster after it was found to
OL,9,Fdemean and objectify women.
OL,11,FThe poster for Great Grass, which
OL,12,Fappeared at the junction of Hollins
OL,13,FRoad and Manchester Road in
OL,14,FFailsworth, Manchester, featured a
OL,15,Fwoman wearing flesh-coloured underwear
OL,16,Fand holding a potted plant in front of
OL,17,Fher crotch, with a headline stating
OL,18,F"No trimming needed!" followed by a
OL,19,Fwink emoji.

OL,6,FThe ASA said those who saw the ad
