OL,8,Fdue to "cracked" trust, the Israeli

OL,12,F"In the midst of a war, more than
OL,13,Fever, full trust is required between
OL,14,Fthe prime minister and defence

OL,16,F"Unfortunately, although in the first
OL,17,Fmonths of the campaign there was such
OL,18,Ftrust and there was very fruitful
OL,19,Fwork, during the last months this
OL,20,Ftrust cracked between me and the

OL,10,FIsrael's PM previously attempted to

OL,19,Fcontinued and spread to Lebanon, key
OL,20,Fpolicy differences started to emerge.
