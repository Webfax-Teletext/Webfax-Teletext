OL,6,FHere are some fire safety tips from
OL,7,FAviva:
OL,9,F` Fire safety
OL,11,FIf possible, it is best to avoid
OL,12,Fgarden bonfires which can quickly get
OL,13,Fout of control, especially during dry
OL,14,Fand windy conditions. If you do light
OL,15,Fa fire, never leave it unattended and
OL,16,Fkeep water or a hose nearby. Exercise
OL,17,Fcaution with fire pits and extinguish
OL,18,Fthem before you go inside. It is also
OL,19,Fa good idea to keep an eye on fires in
OL,20,Fneighbouring gardens, in case they
OL,21,Fspread.

OL,6,F` Barbecue with caution
OL,8,FBefore barbecuing, check the weather
OL,9,Fforecast for any windy weather which
OL,10,Fcan make barbecuing significantly more
OL,11,Fdangerous. Gusts of wind can carry hot
OL,12,Fembers or sparks several feet away,
OL,13,Fincreasing the possibility of a fire.
OL,14,FWhen barbecuing, be mindful that ash
OL,15,Fcan stay hot for days, so wait until
OL,16,Fit has cooled before disposing. Always
OL,17,Fplace disposable barbecues on a non-
OL,18,Fflammable or heat resistant surface,
OL,19,Faway from grass, fences, or sheds and
OL,20,Fleave them until they have cooled
OL,21,Fcompletely.
