OL,6,FReddit has filed a lawsuit in
OL,7,FAustralia's High Court just two days
OL,8,Fafter the country implemented its
OL,9,Flandmark social media ban for children.
OL,11,FThe online forum is one of ten social
OL,12,Fmedia sites that were banned for users
OL,13,Funder the age of 16 in Australia after
OL,14,Fthe government and campaigners deemed
OL,15,Fthe platforms harmful to young people.
OL,17,FReddit is complying with the ban, but
OL,18,Fhas challenged the law over concerns
OL,19,Fabout privacy and political rights,
OL,20,Fand argued the new law fails to
OL,21,Fprotect children online.
