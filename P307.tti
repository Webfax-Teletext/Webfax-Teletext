OL,7,FThe Attorney General appears to have
OL,8,Fcompared calls for the UK to leave
OL,9,Finternational courts with Nazi Germany.
OL,11,FLord Richard Hermer KC said the idea
OL,12,Fthat the UK can breach international
OL,13,Fobligations is a "radical departure
OL,14,Ffrom the UK's constitutional
OL,15,Ftradition".
OL,17,FLord Hermer used a speech in London on
OL,18,FThursday to say claims that
OL,19,Finternational law can be "put aside"
OL,20,Fwere made in the early 1930s in
OL,21,FGermany.
