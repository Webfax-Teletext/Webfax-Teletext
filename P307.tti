OL,3,CWhy has the Southport murder suspect
OL,4,Cnot been charged with terrorism?
OL,6,FThe two additional charges Axel
OL,7,FRudakubana now faces raise a very
OL,8,Fpuzzling question.
OL,10,FHow can an alleged murderer be charged
OL,11,Fwith possessing part of a terror
OL,12,Fmanual, but not be accused of
OL,13,Fterrorism himself?
OL,15,FThe answer is nuanced and both the
OL,16,Fpolice and the Home Office are clearly
OL,17,Fconcerned that that nuance will be
OL,18,Flost.
OL,20,FHere is their explanation.

OL,6,FIt is an offence to possess an Al-
OL,7,FQaeda manual.
OL,9,FBut it is not necessarily the case
OL,10,Fthat the manual inspired the other

OL,6,FAt a time when trust in policing,

OL,8,Ftoday's news will undoubtedly fuel
OL,9,Fconspiracy theories.
OL,11,FBut the situation is complicated.
OL,13,FWhen charges are made, under the law,
OL,14,Fvery little about a case can be

OL,17,FPolice took the extraordinary step
OL,18,Ftoday of revealing what they have
