OL,3,CWhy Jake Berry's defection makes
OL,4,CReform UK a more serious proposition
OL,6,FSir Jake Berry is a serious
OL,7,Fpolitician. His defection to Reform UK
OL,8,Fmakes them a more serious proposition.
OL,10,FThis is significant because
OL,11,Fseriousness is something Reform have
OL,12,Fstruggled with. As a rapidly growing
OL,13,Fparty which values forthright
OL,14,Fopinions, Reform tends to attract
OL,15,Fstrong characters.
OL,17,FThe party's vetting procedures for
OL,18,Fcandidates have been somewhere between
OL,19,Finadequate and nonexistent - Nigel
OL,20,FFarage has admitted as much.

OL,6,FBerry is a former Tory Party Chairman
OL,7,Fwho was a major influence on Boris
