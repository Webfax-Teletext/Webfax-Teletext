OL,8,Fdelays in the criminal justice system
OL,9,Fare currently at the worst he has seen

OL,13,FDirector of Public Prosecutions
OL,14,FStephen Parkinson said reducing delays
OL,15,Fwas his "highest priority" since

OL,12,F"One of the consequences of that is

OL,16,FSome 20% of adult rape cases involving
