OL,7,FI have a few more reflections to share
OL,8,Fon Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring
OL,9,FStatement that we'll hear on Wednesday.
OL,11,FThe first is that the Office for
OL,12,FBudget Responsibility is bound to make
OL,13,Fa gloomier forecast for real household
OL,14,Fdisposable income - a proxy for our

OL,7,FBack then, it said Real Household

OL,10,Fon average.
OL,12,FSneeze and any rise in our living
OL,13,Fstandards would vanish.
OL,15,FThere's been a sneezing fit.
OL,17,FWell, as I reported last week, it is
OL,18,Fdowngrading this year's GDP growth
OL,19,Fforecast from 2% to 1%, and will also
OL,20,Fcut its forecast for next year from

OL,8,Fthe government's choice to reduce

OL,7,FI have two other facts to share.
OL,9,FThe first is that Reeves will only
OL,10,Fmake spending and welfare cuts that
OL,11,Frestore her eroded fiscal headroom of
OL,12,Fa short #9.9 billion, rather than
OL,13,Fincrease it.
OL,15,FThis is a pretty racy bet by her.
OL,16,FShe's taking a big economic and
OL,17,Fpolitical risk in not increasing
OL,18,Fheadroom to double or treble that.
OL,20,FThe point is that #9.9 billion is
OL,21,Falmost no buffer or headroom at all.
