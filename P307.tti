OL,6,FRishi Sunak has dodged ruling out a
OL,7,FJuly general election again, amid
OL,8,Fspeculation that a disastrous set of
OL,9,Flocal elections results for the Tories
OL,10,Fcould force his hand.
OL,12,FThe prime minister said he would not
OL,13,F"say anything more than I've already
OL,14,Fsaid", which is that the national poll
OL,15,Fis likely to be in the second half of
OL,16,Fthe year.
OL,18,FMost Westminster analysts take this as
OL,19,Fmeaning October or November, although
OL,20,Fit could technically also mean July.
