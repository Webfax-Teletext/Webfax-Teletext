OL,7,Ftold she had desmoplastic small round

OL,10,Fchemotherapy.
OL,12,FShe's been told her cancer is now
OL,13,Fchemo-resistant.
OL,15,F"At this point... I would rather have

OL,17,FI did yesterday, doing my photography
OL,18,Fand being with my family as opposed to
OL,19,Fbeing in hospital and dealing with a
