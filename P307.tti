OL,8,FWhen Donald Trump and Kamala Harris
OL,9,Fwalk out onto the debate stage in
OL,10,FPhiladelphia, it will be first time
OL,11,Fthey have ever met.
OL,13,FThey have never shaken hands, never
OL,14,Fsaid hello to each other before.
OL,16,FBut their exchanges on Tuesday night,
OL,17,Fbehind podiums and in front of the

OL,4,Ccrucial TV debates in history
OL,6,FThe debate, between a former president
OL,7,Fand a candidate who has only been in
OL,8,Fthe race for two months, is certainly
OL,9,Fone of the most unusual in American
OL,10,Fhistory.
OL,12,FWhat is at stake?
OL,14,FThe polls put this election on a knife
OL,15,Fedge.
OL,17,FThe latest, from the New York Times,
OL,18,Fputs former president Trump on 48%,
OL,19,Fand Vice President Harris on 47%.
OL,20,FThose are national numbers.
