OL,6,FThe skies in parts of the UK were lit
OL,7,Fup with a dazzling display of the
OL,8,FNorthern Lights, also known as aurora
OL,9,Fborealis, on Tuesday night.
OL,11,FThis is part of something far greater,
OL,12,Fdubbed a 'cannibal storm,' which could
OL,13,Fimpact our communication technology.
OL,15,FThe British Geological Society (BGS)
OL,16,Fsaid this could be the "largest solar
OL,17,Fstorm in over two decades" with
OL,18,Factivity reaching the highest level of
OL,19,FG5 and the biggest geoelectric field
OL,20,Fsince 2012.

OL,10,FHow are the Northern Lights formed?
OL,12,FIn its simplest form, energy from the
OL,13,Fsun heats and energises particles in
OL,14,Four atmosphere.
OL,16,FJust like any build up of energy, this

OL,20,Fthe form of lightning).

OL,3,C'Cannibal storm' causes Northern

OL,6,FIn this case, this build up of solar
OL,7,Fenergy is released as light. When the
OL,8,Fsolar-charged particles interact with
OL,9,Foxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere,
OL,10,Fthese particles produce a whole
OL,11,Fspectrum of different coloured lights;
OL,12,Fblue, red, purple, pink, green, yellow.
OL,14,FWhere does the name come from?
OL,16,FAurora borealis is named after Aurora
OL,17,Fwho is the Roman Goddess of dawn and
OL,18,Fborealis which is Latin for "north" or
OL,19,F"northern."

OL,6,FThere have recently been a series of

OL,8,Fincreased the number of supercharged

OL,14,FFar north and northwest of Scotland
