OL,9,FA partial lunar eclipse will be
OL,10,Fvisible in the UK skies just before
OL,11,Fdawn on Friday, giving keen stargazers
OL,12,Fa chance to see the 'blood moon'.
OL,14,FThe moon will darken as it moves into
OL,15,FEarth's shadow and will eventually
OL,16,Fturn red - which is how the cosmic
OL,17,Fphenomenon earned its nickname.
OL,19,FIt will be the first lunar eclipse
OL,20,Fsince May 2022, when the moon turned
OL,21,Fcompletely red.

OL,9,FWhat is a partial lunar eclipse and
OL,10,Fhow does a blood moon form?
OL,12,FIn a partial lunar eclipse, the sun,
OL,13,FEarth, and moon are almost, rather
OL,14,Fthan fully, aligned.
OL,16,FThis means a dark section appears on
OL,17,Fthe moon.

OL,6,FDr Malcolm Fairbairn, a physics
OL,7,Fprofessor at Kings College London,
OL,8,Ftold ITV News: "If the Earth is
OL,9,Fcompletely in the way of the sun, the
OL,10,Fonly light which gets through to light
OL,11,Fup the moon is the light scattered by
OL,12,FEarth's atmosphere.
OL,14,F"The moon isn't completely dark
OL,15,Fbecause of this, but the majority of
OL,16,Fthat scattered light which gets
OL,17,Fthrough is red, so the moon takes on a
OL,18,Freddish tinge."

OL,12,FHe added: "The moon will be very low
