OL,9,FAccording to NASA, it's because the
OL,10,Fsun's solar cycle is reaching its peak.
OL,12,FThe solar cycle is a natural cycle the
OL,13,Fsun goes through as it transitions
OL,14,Fbetween low and high magnetic
OL,15,Factivity. This happens roughly every
OL,16,F11 years.
OL,18,FDuring the most active part of the
OL,19,Fcycle, known as solar maximum, the sun
OL,20,Fcan unleash immense explosions of
OL,21,Flight, energy, and solar radiation.

OL,13,FThe colours are determined by the type
