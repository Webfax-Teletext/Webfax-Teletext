OL,7,FA US court has ruled that President
OL,8,FDonald Trump illegally used emergency
OL,9,Fpowers to impose sweeping tariffs but
OL,10,Fleft them in place for now.
OL,12,FThe US Court of Appeals for the
OL,13,FFederal Circuit found, in a 7-4
OL,14,Fruling, that the president had no
OL,15,Flegal right to impose the tariffs, and
OL,16,Fthat he overstepped his authority
OL,17,Funder an emergency powers law.
