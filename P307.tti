OL,3,CChancellor may reduce spending by #6bn

OL,6,FHere is the basic math that confronts
OL,7,FHunt.JThe so-called "headroom" for any
OL,8,Ftax cuts or spending increases, were
OL,9,Fhe to do nothing at all, would be
OL,10,Faround #13 billion. That's what the
OL,11,Flatest still-confidential forecast of
OL,12,Fthe Office for Budget Responsibility
OL,13,Fsays.JAs I understand it, the
OL,14,FChancellor has decided that, in the
OL,15,Fexceptional circumstances of a looming
OL,16,Fgeneral election and a stagnating
OL,17,Feconomy, it would be just-about
OL,18,Facceptable to reduce that headroom to
OL,19,F#6bn.JHeadroom of #6 billion is low by
OL,20,Fhistorical standards, but Hunt feels
OL,21,Fit would be defendable - just.JThis
OL,22,F"headroom" is the monetary buffer that
OL,23,Fexists to absorb unexpected calls on
OL,24,Fthe public finances, such that debt as
OL,25,Fa share of GDP, or national income,
OL,26,Ffalls marginally in five year's time,

OL,6,FWe can talk another time about whether
OL,7,Fthis rule is sensible or Dali-esque
OL,8,Fnonsense. It is what it is.JIf Hunt is
OL,9,Fcontent with #6 billion of headroom,
OL,10,Fhe would have #7 billion to deploy to
OL,11,Fhis political preference of cutting
OL,12,Ftaxes on income or enough for just a
OL,13,Fpenny off the basic rate of income
OL,14,Ftax. A 1p cut in the rate of employee
OL,15,Fnational insurance would be #2 billion

OL,17,Fpointed out, it would be a political
OL,18,Fdisaster for both Hunt and Rishi Sunak
OL,19,Fto deliver income tax cuts as small as

OL,6,FSo close to a general election, they

OL,9,Fespecially when so many of their Tory

OL,21,Frate of inflation, 1% "real" in the

OL,6,FAs it happens, opinion polls would
OL,7,Ftend to support Labour that reducing
OL,8,Fhospital waiting lists, for example,
OL,9,Fshould take precedent over tax cuts.
OL,10,FHowever, Starmer and Reeves have said

OL,17,Fother initiatives - including the
OL,18,Ftraditional refusal to uprate fuel

OL,20,Fneeds to find other funding sources.
