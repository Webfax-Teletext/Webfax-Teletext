OL,6,F1. Firstly, try contacting the
OL,7,Fretailer directly to explain what has
OL,8,Fhappened and request a refund.
OL,10,F2. If the retailer does not respond or
OL,11,Frefuses to refund you, report the
OL,12,Ftransaction to your bank. Many will
OL,13,Fallow you to report transactions
OL,14,Fonline in your mobile banking app.
OL,16,F3. If you have paid by card, you could
OL,17,Fask your bank to file a chargeback
OL,18,Fclaim. You will need to give your bank
OL,19,Fthe details of the transaction you are
OL,20,Fdisputing and a description of what
OL,21,Fwent wrong with the item you ordered.
