OL,9,F- and the latest YouGov MRP poll
OL,10,Fsuggests Sunak has more than a
OL,11,Fmountain to climb - such that Labour
OL,12,Fwould inevitably win.
OL,14,FWith that conviction, all Farage cares
OL,15,Fabout, he said, is that the right wing

OL,14,Fwhatever Tory MPs say about welcoming

OL,6,FHe also said that there is no way he
OL,7,Fcan be bought off by Sunak, since he
OL,8,Fbroadly believes the country went to
OL,9,Fthe dogs after he stood down
OL,10,Fcandidates in 2019 for Boris Johnson.
OL,12,FThe only deal Farage would
OL,13,Fcontemplate, he said, would be Tory
OL,14,Fcandidates being forced to stand down
OL,15,Fby Sunak in favour of Reform. That is
OL,16,Fnever going to happen, he conceded.
