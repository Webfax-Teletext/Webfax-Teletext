OL,6,FA new bat coronavirus could spread to
OL,7,Fhumans in the same way Covid did, a
OL,8,Fteam of Chinese researchers found.
OL,10,FA study, published in the journal
OL,11,FCell, said that it is possible that
OL,12,FHKU5-CoV-2 uses the same cell-surface
OL,13,Fprotein as SARS-CoV-2 to enter human
OL,14,Fcells.
OL,16,FBut it added that it does not enter

OL,18,FCovid-19 - does.
