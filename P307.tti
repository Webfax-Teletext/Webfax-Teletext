OL,6,FTwo new Covid variants are spreading
OL,7,Frapidly throughout the UK, and
OL,8,Falthough they are likely to only cause
OL,9,Fminor illnesses, health officials have
OL,10,Furged people to be vigilant.
OL,12,FThe XFG strain, known as Stratus, and
OL,13,FNB.1.8.1 strain, known as Nimbus, are
OL,14,Fnow the most common Covid variants in
OL,15,Fthe UK.
OL,17,FAccording to the UK Health Security
OL,18,FAgency (UKHSA), roughly 63% of
OL,19,Fmonitored cases in the UK were
OL,20,FStratus, while 25% were Nimbus.
