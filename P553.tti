OL,4,
OL,5,FThe revamp of STV News looks good but
OL,6,Fis hardly worth the hyperbole of some
OL,7,Fclickbait articles.
OL,9,FIt is a simple evolution of the look of
OL,10,Fthe programme.
OL,12,FIts last significant visual overhaul
OL,13,Fwas 10 years ago. Time alone means it
OL,14,Fis now time to freshen things up.
OL,16,FEverything changes but everything

OL,4,
OL,5,FThe new set is still a very similar
OL,6,Fshade of blue. The signature tune has
OL,7,Fonly been remixed slightly.
OL,9,FThe format of the programme - revised
OL,10,Flast year when dual presentation from
OL,11,Fboth Glasgow and Edinburgh ended -
OL,12,Fremains the same.
OL,14,FThe advantage of the new set is that it
OL,15,Flooks more modern and allows more space
OL,16,Ffor reporters to join the presenter.
OL,18,FBut I bet 90% of viewers will hardly
OL,19,Fnotice the changes in a couple of
OL,20,Fweeks. And this is how it should be.

OL,4,
OL,5,FThe days when regional news programmes

OL,7,Fyears are thankfully gone.
OL,9,FNew looks always brought complaints -
OL,10,Fsome viewers simply disliked the
OL,11,Funfamiliarity.
OL,13,FThe STV News at 6 is a successful
OL,14,Fprogramme. The challenge was to build a
OL,15,Fnew set, refresh the graphics and
OL,16,Fpotentially enhance the programme
OL,17,Fwithout annoying loyal viewers.

OL,8,Felements and format, simply freshening
OL,9,Fup the appearance and taking advantage
OL,10,Fof new technology.
OL,12,FThere is no suggestion of any change to
