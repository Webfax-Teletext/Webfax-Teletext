OL,6,F"When I first opened, fish and chips
OL,7,Fwas under #1," said John. "It's now
OL,8,F#6. I could charge more but I don't
OL,9,Fwant to rip people off. From what
OL,10,Fpeople tell me, I know other places
OL,11,Fcharge more and they're bigger than me
OL,12,Fand probably buying it cheaper than
OL,13,Fme, but I just do my own prices.
OL,15,F"I just charge as little as I can and
OL,16,Fstill make a profit to cover my bills."
OL,18,FJohn was just 23 when he took over the
OL,19,Fchippy in 1987. Known locally as
OL,20,FGordon Street chippy, John moved from
OL,21,FParbold to live above the premises.

OL,9,Fjust two days a week: "For the last

OL,12,Fthan six days of gas and electric, I'm
