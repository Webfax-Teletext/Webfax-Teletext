OL,6,FBed blocking refers to when patients
OL,7,Fare medically fit to leave treatment
OL,8,Fbut don't have ongoing care to go to.
OL,10,FBut now the Royal Preston hospital,
OL,11,FLancashire, which has around 80
OL,12,Fpatients at one time who are at a
OL,13,Fstandstill, says it is determined to
OL,14,Fhelp get more home and back into the
OL,15,Fcommunity.

OL,7,Fconsultant at the hospital explained:
OL,8,F"What happens at the backdoor of the

OL,10,Fgetting patients home - has got a big
OL,11,Fimpact on what we do for the acutely

OL,14,FIt is a scheme which is already
OL,15,Fproving successful - 84-year-old
OL,16,FErnest Turner arrived at the hospital
OL,17,Fwith breathing problems, and fluid on
OL,18,Fhis lungs, but swift treatment meant
OL,19,Fhe could go home to his wife Annie
OL,20,Fafter just two days.
