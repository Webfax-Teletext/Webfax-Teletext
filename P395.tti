OL,3,CCoroner warning on home births after
OL,4,Cdeath of mother and newborn baby
OL,6,FMrs Cahill had opted for a home birth
OL,7,Fafter suffering complications during
OL,8,Fher first delivery, including a post-
OL,9,Fpartum haemorrhage for which she
OL,10,Freceived an iron and blood transfusion.
OL,12,FJoanne Kearsley, senior coroner for
OL,13,Fthe district of Manchester North,
OL,14,Ffound Mrs Cahill "had not made an
OL,15,Finformed decision to have a home
OL,16,Fbirth" and if the relevant information
OL,17,Fhad been given to her "it is more
OL,18,Flikely than not she would have given
OL,19,Fbirth in an alternative setting", and
OL,20,Fboth mother and baby would have
OL,21,Fsurvived.
