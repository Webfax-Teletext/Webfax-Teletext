OL,6,FIn his inaugural speech as the new
OL,7,FWaterstones Children's Laureate, the
OL,8,Fauthor said Britain was "a stranger to
OL,9,Fequality", with more than 4.3 million
OL,10,Fchildren growing up in poverty in the
OL,11,Fcountry, which he said was creating a
OL,12,Fbarrier to books, and added that
OL,13,F"children who read regularly are more
OL,14,Flikely to overcome disadvantage".
OL,16,FHe said: "Other Laureates have visited
OL,17,Flots of libraries and lots of schools,
OL,18,Fbut I want to be knocking on the door
OL,19,Fof Number 10 and saying it's about
OL,20,Ftime we did something about this
OL,21,Fnationally."
