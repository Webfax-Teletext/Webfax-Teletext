OL,3,C'Pressure release valve': The new law
OL,4,Cguaranteeing leave for unpaid carers
OL,6,FAn unpaid carer is classed as anyone
OL,7,Fwho cares for someone ill, disabled,
OL,8,Folder, has mental health concerns, or
OL,9,Fis experiencing addiction and is not
OL,10,Fpaid by a company of local authority
OL,11,Fto do this.
OL,13,FTypically, an unpaid carer is looking
OL,14,Fafter a family member or friend.
OL,16,FUnder the Carers Leave Act, employees
OL,17,Fcan take unpaid leave in full or half
OL,18,Fdays, or in a whole block of five
OL,19,Fdays, and must give advance notice
OL,20,Fthat is twice the length of time that
OL,21,Fneeds to be taken.

OL,6,F"This is incredibly important because

OL,13,FHowever, Employment Services Director

OL,18,FShe said: "I can honestly say I've
