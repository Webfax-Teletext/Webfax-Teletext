OL,6,FSpeaking about the early days of
OL,7,FWings, Sir Paul said: "The times with
OL,8,FWings were exciting because we built
OL,9,Fup to it, and eventually we hit the
OL,10,Fbig time, there was a particular kind
OL,11,Fof excitement in achieving that goal.
OL,13,F"After The Beatles I didn't really
OL,14,Fknow how to be in a band, it was a
OL,15,Fcomplete blank canvas, we'd go on the
OL,16,Froad with no plans, no hotels booked,
OL,17,Fno gigs lined up, and we thought the
OL,18,Fonly place we might find a captive
OL,19,Faudience was at a university.
