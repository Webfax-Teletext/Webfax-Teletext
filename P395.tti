OL,6,FA mum, who says cancer 'stole' her
OL,7,Ffirst-time mum experience, is calling
OL,8,Fon others to get themselves checked if
OL,9,Fthey spot any signs.
OL,11,FKeisha Chadwick was nine months
OL,12,Fpregnant when she felt a lump on her
OL,13,Fbreast while trying to encourage her
OL,14,Fbreast milk supply.
OL,16,FThe 31-year-old, from Manchester,
OL,17,Fthought nothing of the discovery and
OL,18,Fwelcomed her baby girl, Miliana-Mae,
OL,19,Fin June 2021.

OL,6,FBut shortly after giving birth, the
OL,7,Fnew mum noticed her milk would dry up
OL,8,Fquickly and the lump near her left
OL,9,Farmpit had grown.
OL,11,FKeisha, who was 28 at the time,
OL,12,Fdecided to contact her GP who referred
OL,13,Fher to a breast clinic. The medic
OL,14,Freassured her the lump was probably
OL,15,Fjust a blocked milk duct.
OL,17,FBut tragically, Keisha's test results
OL,18,Fshowed she had breast cancer, while
OL,19,Fcaring for her baby daughter at just
OL,20,Fseven-weeks-old.

OL,10,F"I said they had to be joking ` I had

OL,12,Fwas going to die; it was just a

OL,18,Funderwent 18 weeks of gruelling
