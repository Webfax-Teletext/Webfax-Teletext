OL,12,Fa meal to celebrate his 99th birthday,
OL,13,Fbut when he opened his door he instead
OL,14,Ffound a wartime tank and a 1942
OL,15,FAmerican Jeep on his doorstep.
OL,17,FFriends and neighbours joined together
OL,18,Fto plan the present for the grandad-of-
OL,19,Ftwo, who served in Normandy at the age
OL,20,Fof 18 during the Second World War, in
OL,21,FBebington, on the Wirral.

OL,6,FNeighbour Jimmy Murray, 77, said the
OL,7,Fsurprise took three months to arrange
OL,8,Fand that all their neighbours kept it
OL,9,Fas a secret to make Bill's day even
OL,10,Fmore special.
OL,12,FJimmy said: "We tried to get him to
OL,13,FNormandy with the veterans this year
OL,14,Fbecause it was 80 years but we were
OL,15,Ftoo late, we missed the boat to get
OL,16,Fhim on it.
OL,18,F"So that's why I organised it all with
OL,19,Fthe tank and the Jeep. He didn't have
OL,20,Fa clue.
