OL,7,Fa High Court challenge after Mr DePree
OL,8,Faccused RBC of breaking an agreement
OL,9,Fmade eight years ago.
OL,11,FIn court documents, Mr DePree claimed
OL,12,Fthat RBC "seemed to desperately want
OL,13,Frid of" the hall, which had fallen
OL,14,Finto dereliction since the council
OL,15,Ftook ownership in the late 1980s.
OL,17,FThis led to an agreement in July 2017
OL,18,Fwhereby Mr DePree could buy the
OL,19,Fproperty for #1 as long as he got
OL,20,Fplanning permission.
