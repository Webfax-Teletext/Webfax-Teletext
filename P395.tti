OL,6,FSpeaking at a policing conference in

OL,8,FMr Jukes said: "The vast majority of
OL,9,Fthat messaging, which was problematic
OL,10,Fonline, was domestic, driven by people
OL,11,Fwho lived in our communities, who were
OL,12,Fstoking fear in those communities.
OL,14,F"But we have seen that turbo-charged
OL,15,Fby bots online. And so as we were
OL,16,Ftracking the amount of traffic,
OL,17,Fhateful traffic, during the 24-hour
OL,18,Fperiod across the days, we would see
OL,19,Ftremendous spikes as around midnight,
OL,20,Fbots kicked in.
