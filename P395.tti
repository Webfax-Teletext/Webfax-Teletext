OL,8,Finterpreters means one in ten people
OL,9,Fwith hearing loss or deafness say
OL,10,Fthey've avoided 999 calls or visits to
OL,11,FA and E departments.
OL,13,FRichard Boddy from Wirral, was born
OL,14,Fprofoundly deaf from birth with a very
OL,15,Flimited understanding of both written
OL,16,Fand spoken English. So he relied
OL,17,Fheavily on interpreters for his sign
OL,18,Flanguage when it came to getting
