OL,6,FThe victim's brother said: "Everyone
OL,7,Fshould be suspicious if someone they
OL,8,Fdon't know contacts them online. The
OL,9,Fscammers are very clever. They target
OL,10,Fthings like online Scrabble because
OL,11,Fthey know they'll find older women
OL,12,Fwith a bit of money.
OL,14,F"She would ask to speak to him on the
OL,15,Fphone and there was always an excuse
OL,16,Fas to why he was unavailable. And he'd
OL,17,Fnever use her name. It was always
OL,18,F'Babe', 'Sweetie', 'Queen' or 'Hunny'
OL,19,Fbecause they have so many on the go
OL,20,Fthat they don't want to risk using the
