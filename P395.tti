OL,7,Fat the moment, it's everything,
OL,8,Fbecause he can't move so I'm cooking
OL,9,Fcleaning, he can hardly move out of
OL,10,Fthe chair I'm having to help him with

OL,13,FIt's a nightmare at the moment, it's

OL,16,Firritable and then I get snappy and I
OL,17,Fdon't mean to but it's really, really
