OL,11,FNathan said: "I could go into more or

OL,6,FNathan, from Wigan, had seen his GP on

OL,8,Fantibiotics for a chest infection, and
OL,9,Fhad not told anyone about the amount

OL,12,FBut when he began coughing up blood,
OL,13,Fbecame lethargic, and was losing

OL,15,Fwhere it was discovered he had a
