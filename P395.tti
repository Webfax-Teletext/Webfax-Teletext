OL,6,FThe NHS trust, which manages both

OL,9,Fdeclared an internal critical
OL,10,Fincident, otherwise referred to a
OL,11,Fbusiness continuity incident.
OL,13,FThis was due to "the ongoing
OL,14,Funprecedented demand" at Arrowe Park's
OL,15,Femergency department which was "more
OL,16,Fthan we have experienced in any winter
OL,17,Fperiod".
OL,19,FThe Trust employs over 6,000 staff and
OL,20,Fcurrently has a capacity of around 800
