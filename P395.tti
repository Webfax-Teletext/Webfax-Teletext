OL,8,Fcentres that have been placed under
OL,9,Freview.
OL,11,FThe Reform-led Lancashire County
OL,12,FCouncil had been considering proposals
OL,13,Fto shut the five day centres after
OL,14,Fconcerns were raised about their
OL,15,F"significantly poor condition".
OL,17,FAlso included in the proposals, which
OL,18,Fwere the subject of a public
OL,19,Fconsultation, were potential plans to
OL,20,Fclose five care homes.

OL,9,Fthe County Council announced the five
OL,10,Fcare homes would not close, but a
OL,11,Fdecision has yet to be made on the
OL,12,Ffuture of the day centres.
OL,14,FConservative councillor Adam Brierley
OL,15,Fwelcomed the announcement, but said
OL,16,FLancashire County Council should
OL,17,Fprovide the "same assurance" to staff
OL,18,Fand users of the day centres.
OL,20,FHe said: "Residents, staff and
