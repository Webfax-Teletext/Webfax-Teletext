OL,8,Fand is often "frightened to death"
OL,9,Fwhen she is forced to walk on the road
OL,10,Fto avoid the cars.
OL,12,FGuide Dogs are calling on the

OL,14,Fpavement parking, which has been
OL,15,Fbanned in London for the last 50 years.
OL,17,FBut in the rest of the UK it is not a

OL,6,F"Getting out and about on my own is
OL,7,Fquite hard sometimes", Nicky explains.
OL,8,F"Especially with cars parked on the
OL,9,Fpavement.
OL,11,F"I don't hear electric cars coming so
OL,12,Fif I have to go into the roadside to
