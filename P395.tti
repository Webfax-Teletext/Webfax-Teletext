OL,11,FA police force has introduced a new
OL,12,Fplan which aims to protect blind and
OL,13,Fvisually impaired people from
OL,14,Ffraudsters who pose as officers.
OL,16,FWhile most people can rely on an

OL,18,Fnumber to confirm their identity,
OL,19,Fblind and visually impaired people are

OL,10,FIf an officer has turned up
