OL,8,Fclearly had no regard for his victims,
OL,9,Frepeatedly targeting innocent people
OL,10,Fand preying on their trust for his own
OL,11,Fselfish gain. He went to extreme
OL,12,Flengths to make his story believable.
OL,14,F"He used fake warrant cards and bank
OL,15,Fpayments to back up his claim that he
OL,16,Fwas a police officer, he showed people
OL,17,Fvideos of pursuits and photographs on
OL,18,Fhis phone to embellish his lies
OL,19,Ffurther, and even pretended to call
OL,20,Fhis bank and show victims screenshots
