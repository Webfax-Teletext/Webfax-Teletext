OL,6,FDespite handing himself into police
OL,7,Fthe following day, David Harwood, 49,
OL,8,Fwas found formally not guilty of
OL,9,Fcausing death by dangerous or careless

OL,11,Fto insufficient evidence in 2018.
OL,13,FBut, six years on, Dylan's mum Tracey
OL,14,FMilligan says she is determined to
OL,15,Ffind some kind of justice and closure
OL,16,Ffor what happened to her son.
OL,18,F"He needs to pay for what he's done.
OL,19,FHe's killed a child, left him dead in
OL,20,Fthe road, you can't walk free after
OL,21,Fthat surely?" she said.

OL,8,FJames Adeley ruled it was in the
OL,9,F"interests of justice" to name Mr

OL,12,FIt found Mr Harwood had likely drunk
