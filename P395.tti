OL,6,FReferring to the Cuerden ward closure,
OL,7,FMr. Nicholls said it was also the
OL,8,Fresult of the fact the facility had
OL,9,Finitially been funded by additional
OL,10,Fmoney pumped into the NHS to deal with
OL,11,FCovid pressures earlier in the
OL,12,Fpandemic. One of its initial uses was
OL,13,Fto assist with patient flow through
OL,14,Fthe hospital system and provide beds
OL,15,Ffor those close to being discharged.
OL,17,FMeanwhile, he told board members "good
OL,18,Fprogress" was being made in attempts
OL,19,Fto avoid redundancies in the wake of
OL,20,Fthe Cuerden shutdown.
