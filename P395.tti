OL,6,F"As keepers, our main role in raising
OL,7,Fthe new youngsters is to ensure the
OL,8,Fadult penguins have all they need.
OL,10,F"Sometimes this can mean providing
OL,11,Fextra fish, which the parents swallow,
OL,12,Fchurn into a high-protein soup, and
OL,13,Fthen regurgitate to feed the chicks.
OL,15,F"We also weigh the chicks regularly so
OL,16,Fthat we can monitor their development
OL,17,F` on average they've gone from a mere
OL,18,F80g to 2.5kg in just 40 days. It's
OL,19,Fbeen a huge team effort.
