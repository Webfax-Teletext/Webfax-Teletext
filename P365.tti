OL,6,FShortly after its colliery closed in
OL,7,F1993, Grimethorpe was dubbed Britain's
OL,8,Fpoorest village.
OL,10,FTwelve years earlier, the census
OL,11,Frecorded that 44% of all workers in
OL,12,Fthe South Yorkshire village were
OL,13,Femployed in the pits.
OL,15,FMany of them walked out during the
OL,16,Fultimately futile strikes of 1984-5.

OL,6,FLike so many other working class
OL,7,Fcommunities, when the colliery closed,
OL,8,Fdepriving it of the industry on which
OL,9,Fit once relied, Grimethorpe entered a
OL,10,Fpredictable period of decline.
OL,12,FFor much of the 1990s unemployment was
OL,13,Fabove 50%. Crime spiralled. Housing
OL,14,Festates were over-run with drugs.
OL,16,FMillions of pounds of investment - and
OL,17,Fthe opening of factories and
OL,18,Fdistribution centres around the former
OL,19,Fpit site - followed.

OL,9,FGrimethorpe still has fewer people in

OL,6,FAt its height, Grimethorpe's colliery

OL,14,FWhen the Conservative government
