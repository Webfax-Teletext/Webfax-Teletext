OL,8,FBurrell.JOne of Britain's oldest
OL,9,Fbutchers has retired after more than
OL,10,F75 years in the trade.
OL,12,FBrian Burrell, 85, landed his first
OL,13,Fjob as a butcher's Saturday boy in
OL,14,FCrowland, near Spalding, in 1948, when
OL,15,Fhe was just ten years-old.
OL,17,F"Rationing was on in the country then,
OL,18,Fso you couldn't just go into any
OL,19,Fbutcher, you had to be registered with
OL,20,Fa certain butcher," Brian said.

OL,13,FBrian's colleagues said they would be
