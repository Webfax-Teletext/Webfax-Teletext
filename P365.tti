OL,3,C'Like tomato soup': Why did river turn
OL,4,Corange?
OL,6,FWitnesses have described the River
OL,7,FCalder in West Yorkshire as resembling
OL,8,F"tomato soup" after it turned a bright
OL,9,Forange colour.
OL,11,FPictures and videos posted on social
OL,12,Fmedia showed the river flowing a
OL,13,Fvibrant colour on Thursday, 24
OL,14,FOctober, with some describing its
OL,15,Fappearance as "insane".
OL,17,FIt is not the first time water courses
OL,18,Fin the area have been discoloured.
OL,20,FSimilar events occurred in both 2014
OL,21,Fand 2022.

OL,6,FThe Environment Agency said it had

OL,8,Fsource of the issue.
OL,10,FWhy does the river turn orange?
OL,12,FDespite tongue-in-cheek speculation
OL,13,Fthat there had been a serious tomato
OL,14,Fsoup leak, or that thousands of litres
OL,15,Fof Iron Bru had somehow found their

OL,17,Fmuch more mundane.

OL,6,FA number of social media users were
OL,7,Fquick to point out the correct reason,
OL,8,Fidentifying disused mines as the
OL,9,Fsource.
OL,11,FIn a Facebook post, Elaine Horsted
OL,12,Fwrote: "It's iron from the hill
OL,13,Fwater... It's always happened when
OL,14,Fwe've had a lot of hill water from the
OL,15,Fold mines up there."
OL,17,FDave Halley added: "Last time it went
OL,18,Fdown the road and dyed all the
OL,19,Froadside house's orange to about 4ft
OL,20,Ffor a couple of miles."

OL,6,FThe Environment Agency confirmed as
OL,7,Fmuch, in a post on X.
OL,9,FA spokesperson said: "We've received
OL,10,Freports about the River Calder turning
OL,11,Fbright orange in Todmorden, which is
OL,12,Fdue to water escaping from old mines.
OL,14,F"Officers are investigating the

OL,19,FThe agency is not expected to take any
OL,20,Ffurther action, with the colour
OL,21,Freturning to normal in due course.
