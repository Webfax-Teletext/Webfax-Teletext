OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV News Ms Ward said
OL,7,Fpolice had "pulled their socks up" but
OL,8,Fadded: "We're not going to draw a line
OL,9,Funder this just because the report is
OL,10,Fout."
OL,12,FMr Spinks said: "Gracie's case has
OL,13,Fjust been so unique and so special.
OL,14,FEveryone has been interested in it and
OL,15,FI think that sums up the person Gracie
OL,16,Fwas. She had that special gift of
OL,17,Fconnecting with people and I think
OL,18,Fthat goes through even down a camera
OL,19,Flens and I think it's made people
OL,20,Fstand up and say we can't have another
OL,21,Fgirl die in this way."
