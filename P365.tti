OL,6,F"It didn't explode though, what
OL,7,Fhappened is it went through the floor
OL,8,Fbefore and exploded on the ground
OL,9,Flevel, which meant it blasted through
OL,10,Fthe whole place," said Martin Naylor,
OL,11,Fa local historian who started the
OL,12,Fcampaign for the plaque in 2022.
OL,14,F"For 19 years it was almost like a
OL,15,Fshrine on the corner there and it
OL,16,Fwasn't until 1959 it was rebuilt," he
OL,17,Fsaid.
OL,19,FThe tragedy was the largest loss of
OL,20,Flife in a single event in Sheffield
OL,21,Fduring the war.

OL,6,F"I remember people of my parents'

OL,8,Fabout the Marples," he said.
OL,10,F"Even in my generation, all
OL,11,FSheffielders were aware of it, but my
OL,12,Fown children and grandchildren knew
OL,13,Fnothing about this piece of history,
OL,14,Fand I was worried that it would
