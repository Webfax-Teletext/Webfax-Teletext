OL,6,FThe National Autistic Society School

OL,9,Fwell as benefiting children, the site
OL,10,Fwill also be available for adults with
OL,11,Fadditional needs.
OL,13,FPaul Atwal-Brice said: "I think for us
OL,14,Fthe passion for this is, as a lot of
OL,15,Fyour viewers know, we have children
OL,16,Fwith disabilities and complex needs.
