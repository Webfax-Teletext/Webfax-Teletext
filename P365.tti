OL,6,FAdders are the UK's only venomous
OL,7,Fsnake, but generally do not pose a
OL,8,Fserious danger to humans.
OL,10,FMost attacks happen when they are
OL,11,Fstepped on or picked up.
OL,13,FThey are protected in law.
OL,15,FPC Newsome said: "If you suspect your
OL,16,Fdog has been bitten by an adder,
OL,17,Fplease contact your vet asap.
OL,19,F"An adder bite is not always fatal,
OL,20,Fbut the venom can cause damage to
OL,21,Forgans if left untreated.
