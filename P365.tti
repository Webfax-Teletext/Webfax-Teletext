OL,6,FThe Terminally Ill Adults (End of

OL,8,Fbut has been held up in the House of
OL,9,FLords as peers work through more than
OL,10,F1,200 amendments.
OL,12,FThe Spen Valley MP said: "We've got a
OL,13,Fvery small number of Lords who are
OL,14,Ffundamentally opposed to a change in
OL,15,Fthe law...trying to talk the bill out.
OL,17,F"It's not a good look for the House of
OL,18,FLords."

OL,4,Cbill "deeply disturbed" by delays
OL,6,FThe bill, which was not introduced by
OL,7,Fthe government, will fall if it does
OL,8,Fnot clear its remaining stages before
OL,9,Fthe end of the parliamentary session,
OL,10,Fwhich will likely come in spring.
OL,12,FBut opponents of the bill have
OL,13,Fsupported the Lords.
OL,15,FSir Edward Leigh, the MP for
OL,16,FGainsborough, told Last Orders "this
OL,17,Fis a highly complex bill...I think
OL,18,Fthey're just doing their job."
OL,20,FHe added that the House of Lords is a
OL,21,F"scrutiny body, not a political body".
