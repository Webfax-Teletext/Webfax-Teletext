OL,6,FElizabeth Day, Deputy Centre Manager,
OL,7,Fsaid: "Matilda has suffered minor
OL,8,Fburns on her paws from the heat of the
OL,9,Fcar engine, but these have healed very
OL,10,Fquickly. She is't in the best
OL,11,Fcondition, with runny eyes that need
OL,12,Fbathing and needing extensive dental
OL,13,Ftreatment, which we were able to
OL,14,Fprovide to alleviate her discomfort.
OL,16,F"We would love to get Matilda home but
OL,17,Fas she isn't microchipped and she has
OL,18,Ftravelled so far, it is proving
OL,19,Fdifficult to locate an owner.
