OL,6,FA new home has been found for
OL,7,Fthousands of love locks that were set
OL,8,Fto be removed from a landmark bridge
OL,9,Fand melted down.
OL,11,FAn estimated 5,000 padlocks have been
OL,12,Ffixed to the Weir footbridge in
OL,13,FBakewell by people celebrating
OL,14,Frelationships or remembering loved
OL,15,Fones since 2011.
OL,17,FBut a major repair project means the
OL,18,Flocks were going to be scrapped by
OL,19,FSeptember - causing an outcry from
OL,20,Fpeople who have locks attached to the
OL,21,Fbridge.

OL,6,FNow, the owner of Thornbridge Hall, a
OL,7,Fnearby stately home, has stepped in
OL,8,Fand said the love locks can be
OL,9,Frelocated there.
OL,11,FRichard Young, who started the 'Save
OL,12,Fthe Love Locks' campaign, said: "There
OL,13,Fhas been a lot of work going on behind
OL,14,Fthe scenes to work out how the near
OL,15,F40,000 memories can be preserved.
OL,17,F"It is our intention to remove the
OL,18,Fpadlocks bay by bay and reinstate them
OL,19,Fonto a similar structure within the
OL,20,Fgrounds of the Hall.

OL,6,F"There will be enough space so that

OL,9,F"We appreciate that it will not be the

OL,11,Fwill be a lasting final resting place
OL,12,Ffor all to enjoy."
OL,14,FIt's hoped that a 'Love Lock' bench
OL,15,Fwill also be placed near to the
OL,16,Foriginal bridge.
OL,18,FMr Young added that details are now
OL,19,Fbeing explored by Derbyshire County
