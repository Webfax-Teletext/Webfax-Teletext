OL,7,Fwhy the party had failed to beat
OL,8,FReform's Luke Campbell in this year's

OL,10,Fand East Yorkshire.
OL,12,FHe told me "we had a great campaign

OL,14,Fwon", despite the Lib Dems losing by

OL,19,F"increasingly confident that Liberal

OL,6,FBut the Lib Dems still face an uphill

OL,9,Fwas in Yorkshire. He is Tom Gordon MP,
OL,10,Fwho represents Harrogate and
OL,11,FKnaresborough.
OL,13,FGordon told me before the conference
OL,14,Fthat he was hoping to get more working

OL,16,Fthe perception of the Lib Dems as
OL,17,Fbeing southern and middle class "was a

OL,8,Fthere's no point in me sitting here
OL,9,Fand mumbling and groaning about it, (I
OL,10,Fam) much happier rolling up my sleeves

OL,14,FThe other major theme of this
