OL,6,FThe FA said it would implement a
OL,7,Fseries of measures following the
OL,8,Fsurvey, including listing clubs with
OL,9,Fpoor behaviour records on its website.
OL,11,FTeams would be mandated to install
OL,12,Fphysical "respect" barriers at games.
OL,13,FThose that failed to do so and
OL,14,Fspectators who cross them could be
OL,15,Fpenalised, the FA said.
OL,17,FReferees will also have the power to
OL,18,Fabandon games if barriers are breached.
