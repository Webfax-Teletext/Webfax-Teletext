OL,7,Ffrom sepsis after doctors dismissed
OL,8,Fhis symptoms as chickenpox says she
OL,9,Fwants his legacy to save other

OL,12,FHelen and Daniel Philliskirk's 16-
OL,13,Fmonth-old son James died in May 2022
OL,14,Fafter making several visits to
OL,15,FChildren's Hospital.
OL,17,FThe trust has admitted failings were
OL,18,Fmade and is now working with the
OL,19,Ffamily to make changes, including
OL,20,Fhiring a new specialist nurse.

OL,7,Fwe want is for James to be alive and
OL,8,Fthat cannot happen.
OL,10,F"However, James loved other babies and
OL,11,Fchildren and I think it's very fitting
OL,12,Fthat his legacy will hopefully keep
OL,13,Fother babies and children more safe."
OL,15,FJames contracted chickenpox and
OL,16,Frecovered in April 2022 but a few
OL,17,Fweeks later he became unwell,
OL,18,Fdeveloped a rash and started to make a
