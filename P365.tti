OL,9,Fapologised after criticism of its
OL,10,FSouth Yorkshire branch's response to a
OL,11,Freport into the Hillsborough disaster.
OL,13,FOn Tuesday 2 December, the IOPC
OL,14,Fpublished a report which found that 12
OL,15,Fofficers would have faced misconduct
OL,16,Fproceedings under current laws over
OL,17,Fthe tragedy in 1989, but no
OL,18,Fdisciplinary proceedings will take
OL,19,Fplace because they had all retired
OL,20,Fwhen investigations began.
