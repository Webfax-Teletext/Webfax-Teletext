OL,3,CSTV losses could see the end of the
OL,4,Cold Grampian region
OL,6,GSo the end looms for what was once
OL,7,GGrampian ` the wee station with the
OL,8,Gbig name.
OL,10,FIt lost its name and local programmes
OL,11,F20 years ago but its news service
OL,12,Flived on.
OL,14,FThe STV News at Six in the northern
OL,15,Fhalf of Scotland was really North
OL,16,FTonight in disguise.
OL,18,FNow it too is to go.
OL,20,FSTV is proposing to change its news
OL,21,Fservice.

OL,6,FThere will, subject to Ofcom approval,
OL,7,Fbe one news service presented from

OL,11,FThe financial situation facing STV is
OL,12,Fserious. It lost #200,000 in the first
OL,13,Fhalf of the year. Advertising is down
OL,14,F#5m.
OL,16,FBut there is profound concern amongst
OL,17,Fpoliticians in the north of Scotland.
OL,19,FOf course the question now is whether
OL,20,FOfcom will allow this change.

OL,6,FOr might sone compromise emerge? Or

OL,9,FOfcom is not the poodle some accuse it
OL,10,Fof being.
OL,12,FIn 2013 it helped reinstate a fuller

OL,15,FBut since then the marketplace has
OL,16,Fchanged.
OL,18,FAdvertising is down. Linear TV is not
