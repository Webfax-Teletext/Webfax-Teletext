OL,6,FOften proper planning takes account of
OL,7,Fthis. Sundays can be the perfect day
OL,8,Ffor features and human stories which

OL,11,FSince the late 80s, ITV regions have
OL,12,Fgenerally provided proper Sunday
OL,13,Fbulletins ` though some were providing
OL,14,Fthem before others. The BBC introduced
OL,15,Fthem in 1995, first in the early
OL,16,Fevening and later after the News at
OL,17,FTen.
OL,19,FThey are vital. Major stories can

OL,21,Fthe nations. Planning for quiet
OL,22,Fweekends is a necessary precaution.

OL,15,FSome clarity is needed on regulatory
