OL,6,FHe has now taken the decision to step
OL,7,Fback entirely at the end of the
OL,8,Fpolitical term having been involved in
OL,9,Fthe States on and off since 1982.
OL,11,FDeputy Roffey's decision is partly
OL,12,Fdown to needing time to adjust after
OL,13,Fthe death of his partner.
OL,15,FHe added: "This feeling is
OL,16,Fstrengthened considerably by the fact
OL,17,Fthat since re- joining the States in
OL,18,F2016 I have suffered a major
OL,19,Fbereavement, losing the person who
OL,20,Fdefined my life.

OL,6,F"In retrospect, taking on a massive
OL,7,Fworkload straight after that loss
OL,8,Fmeant I never really gave myself the
OL,9,Ftime or space to fully adjust to new
OL,10,Frealities. I now intend to give myself
OL,11,Fthat space.

OL,19,FStates instead.
