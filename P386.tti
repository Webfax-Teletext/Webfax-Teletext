OL,6,FA Guernsey couple have started a

OL,8,Fnext to a beach on the west coast.
OL,10,FBill and Margaret Masterton have been
OL,11,Fvisiting Grandes Rocques for more than
OL,12,F60 years but say the lack of spaces to
OL,13,Fleave cars is becoming a hazard.
OL,15,FThey live in St Martins but have to
OL,16,Fdrive to the coast as they cannot
OL,17,Fmanage the steep hills near their home.

OL,6,FMargaret explains: "At times the
OL,7,Fparking becomes quite dangerous. The
OL,8,Fcar parks are full and three abreast
OL,9,Fso the ones in the middle couldn't get
OL,10,Fout and tempers were frayed."
OL,12,FThe former overflow next to the
OL,13,Fbeach's main car park used to provide
OL,14,Fspace for more than 30 vehicles but
OL,15,Fwas closed earlier this year so that
OL,16,Fthe area could be restored as a
OL,17,Fcoastal grassland habitat.
