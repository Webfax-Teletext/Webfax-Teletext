OL,8,Fsignificant seizure of cannabis and
OL,9,Fdemonstrates both the high level of
OL,10,Fvigilance our Officers have in dealing
OL,11,Fwith postal traffic and the ability

OL,15,Finvolved in this level of criminality.
OL,17,F"Undoubtedly the disruption caused to
OL,18,Fthe syndicate involved will be
OL,19,Fsignificant and the resulting sentence
OL,20,Freflects the seriousness of the
OL,21,Foffence."
