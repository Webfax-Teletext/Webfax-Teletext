OL,4,Creferendum is 'under consideration'
OL,6,FDeputy Bailhache explains: "It is
OL,7,Funder consideration. Before any
OL,8,Fserious step is taken to remove the
OL,9,FBailiff from the Chambers, the public
OL,10,Fwould be consulted in a referendum.
OL,12,F"It is an issue for the public to
OL,13,Fdecide because it is a constitutional
OL,14,Fissue."
OL,16,FOne social media user echoed this in a
OL,17,Fresponse to the original proposition,
OL,18,Fsaying: "I think that such a major
OL,19,Fconstitutional change should require a
OL,20,Freferendum. It is arrogance for the
OL,21,Fassembly to do this without one."
