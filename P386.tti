OL,11,FHe is Chair of the Aspinall
OL,12,FFoundation, a global charity founded
OL,13,Fby his father John to protect
OL,14,Fendangered species.
OL,16,FDamian explains: "I think it's a very
OL,17,Fsad experience that any animal today
OL,18,Fis in captivity, we have to look back
OL,19,Fover the last 30 to 40 years and
OL,20,Funderstand that it's been a terrible
OL,21,Fmistake.

OL,6,F"If you look at the 5,500 species in
OL,7,Fzoos, 95% are not critically

OL,10,F"Then if you look at the critically
OL,11,Fendangered species, there's 45 of them
OL,12,Fand only four are viable. The rest of

OL,6,FFormer senior staff members claim that
OL,7,Fthe charity has moved away from its
OL,8,Ffounder Gerald Durrell's vision of
OL,9,Fsaving endangered animals.
OL,11,FDamian adds: "I urge all zoos to be
OL,12,Fhonest with the public and if they're
OL,13,Fnot doing conservation work then just
OL,14,Fbe honest and say, 'look, we're a
OL,15,Fsanctuary for animals, there's no
OL,16,Fconservation value', or 'we're a
OL,17,Fbusiness and we're here to put animals
OL,18,Fin captivity open to the public', but
OL,19,Fto mislead the public that they're
OL,20,Fdoing great conservation work is
OL,21,Fsimply not true."

OL,12,FIn response, Dr Mike Hudson, a
OL,13,FDirector at Durrell Wildlife
OL,14,FConservation Trust, says: "50% of the
