OL,6,FGuernsey's Chief Minister says the
OL,7,Fproposed 2% increase in income tax is
OL,8,Fnot a long-term solution but a
OL,9,Fnecessary move to fight a financial
OL,10,Fsituation which has "deteriorated".
OL,12,FDeputy Lyndon Trott warned States
OL,13,Fmembers today (5 November) in a debate
OL,14,Fon the 2025 Budget that not increasing
OL,15,Fincome tax for the next two years
OL,16,Fwould add extra pressure to public
OL,17,Ffinances which already contain a #24
OL,18,Fmillion black hole.

OL,10,Fmore accurately articulated around

OL,14,F"I think more and more people have

OL,16,Fand one of the most striking
OL,17,Fstatistics is the fact that we spend
OL,18,F14% less on a per capita basis on
