OL,6,FThis September marks 100 years since
OL,7,Fthe very first excavation of La Hougue
OL,8,FBie in Jersey.
OL,10,FThe passage grave, situated in
OL,11,FGrouville, was built in 3500 BC and is
OL,12,Fthought to be one of the oldest
OL,13,Fbuildings in the world.
OL,15,FIts ancient chamber was once a sacred

OL,17,Fwas built to align with the rising sun
OL,18,Fat the Spring and Summer Equinoxes.

OL,8,FThe tomb was built by our Neolithic
