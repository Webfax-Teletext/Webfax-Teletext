OL,6,FA Scrutiny Panel in Jersey has found
OL,7,Fthat islanders with attention deficit
OL,8,Fhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could
OL,9,Fexperience less stress, if more health
OL,10,Fstaff were trained to issue medication
OL,11,Fprescribed to manage the neurological
OL,12,Fcondition.
OL,14,FThe Health and Social Security
OL,15,FScrutiny Panel published a report
OL,16,Ffollowing its review of the current
OL,17,Fprocess for prescribing medication to
OL,18,Fadults with ADHD.

OL,6,FThe review began in July after the
OL,7,FPanel heard that ADHD medication can
OL,8,Fcurrently only be prescribed by a
OL,9,Fspecialist consultant psychiatrist,
OL,10,Frather than GPs and other trained
OL,11,Fstaff.
OL,13,FCurrently Jersey only has one in post
OL,14,Fwho can assess and diagnose patients,
OL,15,Fbut the Panel heard they spend the
OL,16,Fmajority of their time issuing repeat
OL,17,Fprescriptions.

OL,20,F3.5 years for an assessment at the

OL,8,FPanel, said: "It is clear to the Panel
OL,9,Fthat people who have shared their
OL,10,Fexperiences with us feel let down by
OL,11,Fthe current system. They are
OL,12,Ffrustrated with the long wait for a
OL,13,Fdiagnosis and lack of communication
OL,14,Fregarding not only that, but the
OL,15,Fimpact the global shortage of ADHD
OL,16,Fmedication could have on them.
OL,18,F"While there is little that Jersey can
OL,19,Fdo to improve the situation regarding
OL,20,Fthe shortage, we can remove some of
OL,21,FtheJother obstacles people are facing.
