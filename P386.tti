OL,6,FOne hundred years ago, Guernsey
OL,7,Fresident Miriam Milbourne rediscovered
OL,8,Fthese goats among the scrub herds on
OL,9,Fthe island and began keeping them.
OL,11,FDuring the 1940s, Miriam hid the goats
OL,12,Ffrom the occupying German forces to
OL,13,Fprotect them from being taken and
OL,14,Fslaughtered.
OL,16,FShe then began a breeding programme in
