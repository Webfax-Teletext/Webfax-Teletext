OL,6,FMinister Tom Binet says: "We will have

OL,15,Fcompared to 0.05% in England.

OL,8,F"The differences in the levels of
OL,9,Fprescribing of medicinal cannabis that
OL,10,Fis taking place in Jersey when
OL,11,Fcompared with England is significant.
OL,13,F"The audit also suggests that some

OL,16,Fharmful to their health, this is of
