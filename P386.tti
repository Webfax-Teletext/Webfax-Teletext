OL,14,Ftesting to see if they carried the

OL,6,FExperts say BRAC genes are something

OL,9,Fare faulty.
OL,11,FDr Hugo De La Pena, a UK Breast Cancer
OL,12,FConsultant said: "The BRCA genes, will
OL,13,Ffix our genes, so they are protective
OL,14,Fgenes, so when you have a BRAC
OL,15,Fmutation, then that fixing mechanism
OL,16,Fis lost, so when the cells get
OL,17,Fdamaged, the cells cannot fix
OL,18,Fthemselves and then the cells become
OL,19,Funstable and that's how you then
OL,20,Fdevelop cancers."
