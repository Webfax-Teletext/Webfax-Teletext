OL,6,FA former Guernsey Chief Minister is
OL,7,Fraising concerns about a new police
OL,8,Fcomplaints process in the island, and
OL,9,Fis calling for it to be annulled.
OL,11,FDeputy Gavin St Pier says a new
OL,12,Fcomplaints system is unfair and leaves
OL,13,Fcomplainants without the opportunity
OL,14,Fto appeal a decision that is made.
OL,16,FThe process allows police to analyse
OL,17,Fevidence, including bodycam footage,
OL,18,Fand consider if there is merit to a
OL,19,Fcomplaint.

OL,11,FDeputy Gavin St Pier is calling for

OL,6,FDeputy St Pier told ITV News: "If a
OL,7,Fcomplaint is made and filtered out and
OL,8,Fno further work is to be undertaken,
OL,9,Fthe complainant can do nothing further
OL,10,Fabout it and I think that is a matter

OL,14,FMeanwhile, Deputy Rob Prow, President
OL,15,Fof Home Affairs, disagrees that the
OL,16,Fnew complaints process is "clumsy" and
OL,17,Fsays an imminent review of police
OL,18,Fprocesses will bring best practices to
OL,19,Fthe island.

OL,11,FHe says that any complaint has to go

OL,14,Fwhich he asserts is an independent way
