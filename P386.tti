OL,6,FSeven Jersey cows which represent some
OL,7,Fof the leading herds on the island
OL,8,Fwill be gifted to the King during his
OL,9,Fvisit on Monday 15 July.
OL,11,FThe heifers were originally due to be

OL,13,FElizabeth II but after King Charles
OL,14,FIII acceded to the throne,
OL,15,Farrangements were made to ship the
OL,16,Fanimals to Windsor.
OL,18,FHowever, one of the leading Jersey
OL,19,Fherds lost more than 100 of its cows
OL,20,Fin December 2022, likely due to a rare
OL,21,Fillness called botulism.
