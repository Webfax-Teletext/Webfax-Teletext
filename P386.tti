OL,6,FSkateboarding is a popular pastime in
OL,7,FJersey, with world-class facilities in
OL,8,FLes Quennevais and .
OL,10,FAlison welcomes the popularity of the
OL,11,Fsport, but is calling for more to be
OL,12,Fdone to prioritise safety: "The
OL,13,Fcommunity has done a great job coming
OL,14,Ftogether to build the skateboard and
OL,15,Fscooter community.
OL,17,F"But I think it's time to take that
OL,18,Fnext step. We have to focus on safety
OL,19,Fand there are a number of inexpensive
OL,20,Fways that we as a community can do
OL,21,Fthat.

OL,6,F"If we're riding anything with wheels,

OL,11,Fchildren aged 13 and under, she is
OL,12,Falso hoping her change could lead to a

OL,16,F"I really ask the community, whether
OL,17,Fyou're a child or an adult, to please
OL,18,Fwear a helmet. Unfortunately, Brian
OL,19,Fpassed, but if he and his story can

OL,21,Fwould just mean so much to both of us."
