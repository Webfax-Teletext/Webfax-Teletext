OL,6,FA Guernsey fisherman has expressed his
OL,7,Fconcern over the decline in brown
OL,8,Fcrabs in Channel Island waters.
OL,10,FThe decrease has been attributed to
OL,11,Fwarmer sea temperatures, scallop
OL,12,Ffishing, dredging and a rise in some
OL,13,Foctopus species.

OL,6,FIn 2021, a team from Jersey Marine

OL,12,FMarine ecologist Dr Samantha Blampied
OL,13,Fsays many of the crabs have headed
