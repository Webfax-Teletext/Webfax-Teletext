OL,6,FThe Alderney Literary Festival has
OL,7,Fbeen cancelled this year, with
OL,8,Forganisers blaming financial pressures
OL,9,Fand "travel uncertainty".
OL,11,FThe event's organiser, Alderney
OL,12,FLiterary Trust, shared the news on
OL,13,Fsocial media with a statement, which
OL,14,Fcalled it a "difficult decision".
OL,16,FThe festival usually takes place every
OL,17,FMarch in the historic Island Hall, and
OL,18,Fhas been running every year since
OL,19,F2014, except during the Covid lockdown

OL,6,FIsabel Picornell, the festival's

OL,13,FMs Picornell added that 80% of those

OL,17,F"We have many world-renowned authors
