OL,7,FSuperconductors are a big deal. Under
OL,8,Fnormal circumstances, materials lose
OL,9,Fenergy as they conduct electricity `
OL,10,Fthat's why, for instance, your mobile
OL,11,Fphone heats up when you charge it.
OL,13,FBut a superconductor doesn't lose
OL,14,Fenergy: it conducts perfectly, with
OL,15,Fno resistance. And superconducting
OL,16,Fmaterials have allowed for important
OL,17,Ftechnological advances: for example,
OL,18,Fin MRI scanners, the magnetic fields
OL,19,Fproduced by superconductors help us
OL,20,Fproduce detailed images of the inside
