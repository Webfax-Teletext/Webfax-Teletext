OL,6,FIs the UK reneging on its commitment
OL,7,Fto carbon reduction? The Government
OL,8,Fhas effectively made it cheaper for
OL,9,Ffirms to pollute in Britain in what
OL,10,Fsome see as another anti-green move
OL,11,Fby Rishi Sunak's administration.
OL,13,FThat's compared to the European
OL,14,FUnion, where regulations have meant
OL,15,Fthat carbon prices have remained
OL,16,Frelatively stable over the year so
OL,17,Ffar. In the UK, where post-Brexit our
OL,18,Fclimate policies have diverged from
OL,19,Fthose of the EU, the cost to industry
OL,20,Fof producing carbon emissions has
OL,21,Fdeclined.
