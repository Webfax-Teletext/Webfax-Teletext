OL,6,FRemember in secondary school biology,
OL,7,Fwhen you learned about ecosystems? You
OL,8,Fmight remember drawing diagrams of the
OL,9,F"food web", where each species either
OL,10,Fpreys upon, or is preyed upon, another
OL,11,Fspecies; if you remove one (say,
OL,12,Ffoxes), you might get too many of
OL,13,Fanother (say, rabbits), which has
OL,14,Ffurther knock-on effects all around the
OL,15,Fsystem (say, more grass than usual, and
OL,16,Fan increase in insects).
OL,18,FYou might even remember the idea of a
OL,19,F"keystone species", which is one whose
OL,20,Floss could cause serious problems for
OL,21,Fthe whole ecosystem.
