OL,10,Fbe removed, that is what we all wanted.
OL,12,F"However this weekend, with good
OL,13,Fweather forecast, will be one of the
OL,14,Fbusiest in Cleethorpes and the last
OL,15,Fthing any of us wanted was for
OL,16,Fvisitors, many of them families, to
OL,17,Fcome to the beach and look out to see
OL,18,Fan abandoned vehicle stuck on the
OL,19,Fshore."
