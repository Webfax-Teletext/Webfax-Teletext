OL,6,F"It is a huge inconvenience", he said.
OL,8,F"We had to shut this down and let our
OL,9,Fcustomer base know and redirect
OL,10,Fbecause they couldn't come through
OL,11,Fhere. We've not got any passing trade
OL,12,Fwhich has impacted our footfall.
OL,14,F"Costs are going up constantly with
