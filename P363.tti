OL,10,FThe roadworks have been stopped while

OL,13,FPrincipal archaeologist Peter Row
OL,14,Fsaid: "The remains are particularly
OL,15,Fsignificant as they are waterlogged,
OL,16,Fmeaning that organic items, which
OL,17,Fwould normally rot away, have
OL,18,Fsurvived."
OL,20,FThe team have also discovered remains
OL,21,Fof walls and foundations of buildings.
