OL,6,FThe impacts of ketamine are different

OL,11,Flinks between those services aren't

OL,6,FThe people I spoke to for this project

OL,8,Fharms being caused by ketamine,
OL,9,Fimproving treatment access and
OL,10,Feducation will be key - and there is
OL,11,Fwork taking place locally and

OL,14,FBut the question of whether ketamine
OL,15,Fshould be upgraded to class A drug is
OL,16,Fmore divisive.
OL,18,FSome think that would better reflect
OL,19,Fits dangers and that illicit supply
