OL,8,Fshocked to see adults encouraging
OL,9,Fchildren to get within a couple of

OL,12,F"It's important to remember that these
OL,13,Fare wild animals. They are
OL,14,Funpredictable, can move surprisingly
OL,15,Ffast, are incredibly strong, and have
OL,16,Fa nasty bite. Approaching them in this
OL,17,Fmanner puts both you and the seal at
OL,18,Frisk."

OL,6,FSeals use beaches to rest, often
