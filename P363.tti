OL,10,FThe HM Inspectorate of Prisons visited
OL,11,Fthe prison over three days in April
OL,12,Fand found it had made progress in a
OL,13,Fnumber of areas since the last visit
OL,14,Fbut there were still areas for concern.
OL,16,FThe report found the prison remained
OL,17,F"severely overcrowded", with too many
OL,18,Fprisoners living in pairs in cells
OL,19,Fdesigned for one person.
