OL,16,Fmeans XL bully owners will be

OL,6,FThe Conservative MP told ITV News:
OL,7,F"Having one of these dogs is like
OL,8,Fhaving a ticking time bomb.
OL,10,F"Certainly, I would not be happy for
OL,11,Fmy grandchildren to go and play at
OL,12,Fsomebody's house where one of these
OL,13,Fdogs was."
OL,15,FAround 35,000 XL bullies have been
OL,16,Fregistered in the UK so far and
OL,17,Fapproximately 150 have been
OL,18,Feuthanised, according to Sir Robert.

OL,4,CXL bully dogs
OL,6,FThe Government introduced legislation
OL,7,Fto restrict the breed after a
OL,8,Fsignificant increase in the number of
OL,9,Fdog attacks in the last couple of
OL,10,Fyears.
OL,12,FSir Robert said that until recently
OL,13,Fthe UK would see approximately 3
OL,14,Fdeaths caused by dogs a year - but
OL,15,Fthat there have been 23 fatalities in
OL,16,Fthe last two years, with 12 of those
OL,17,Fbeing caused by XL bullies.

OL,6,FResponding to concerns from dog owners
OL,7,Fthat the banned breed was being made a
OL,8,Fscapegoat for their treatment by
OL,9,Firresponsible owners, Sir Robert said:
OL,10,F"I would never leave any dog, even a
OL,11,Fterrier, with a baby unsupervised.
OL,13,F"These dogs have been very
OL,14,Fdisproportionate in terms of the
OL,15,Fattacks that have taken place."
OL,17,FHe added: "Unfortunately, you can't do
OL,18,Fvery much about what the owners do but
OL,19,Fthe fact of the matter is that these
OL,20,Fdogs are dangerous.

OL,13,FSir Robert said XL bullies are 275

OL,17,FHe also said the dogs were highly
