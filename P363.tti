OL,8,Flast month that he had a county court
OL,9,Fjudgement (CCJ) against his name.
OL,11,FAfter failing in his attempts to
OL,12,Fresolve the matter, Mr Moody staged an
OL,13,Feye-catching protest by occupying the
OL,14,FBooths car park with his living room
OL,15,Ffurniture, ornaments - and even his
OL,16,Fdog.
OL,18,FAnd he says he is prepared to step up
