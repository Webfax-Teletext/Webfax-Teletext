OL,6,FPolice are looking for a dog walker
OL,7,Fover the death of a horse which was
OL,8,Fhit by a car after apparently being
OL,9,Fspooked.
OL,11,FSisters Lili-Ana and Maisy Pyne were
OL,12,Friding with friends in Lofthouse, near
OL,13,FWakefield, when they say a loose dog
OL,14,Fpanicked their horse, Loki.
OL,16,FLili-Ana was thrown to the ground as
OL,17,FLoki ran off. The horse was hit by a
OL,18,Fcar and had to be put down by vets at
OL,19,Fthe scene.

OL,8,FIf I'd have stayed on him and the car

OL,19,FThe incident happened on Leeds Road at

OL,9,Fdied and 43 where people were injured.
OL,11,FA spokesperson said: "By nature dogs

OL,14,Fwill take over by chasing or fleeing.
