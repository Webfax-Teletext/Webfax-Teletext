OL,7,Fbecause they don't want to know the

OL,11,FWindass, who won promotion to the
OL,12,FPremier League with Hull in 2008, was
OL,13,Fdiagnosed with stage two dementia in
OL,14,FJanuary last year.
OL,16,FHe told hosts Ed Balls and Ranvir
OL,17,FSingh: "John (Stiles) asked me about a
OL,18,Fyear and half ago (to get a scan) and
OL,19,FI declined.
