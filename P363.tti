OL,6,FAngela said she suffered with post-

OL,8,Fincident.
OL,10,F"It's broken all of us really," she
OL,11,Fsaid. "I don't think any of us will
OL,12,Fever be the same again. I know I
OL,13,Fwon't."
OL,15,FAngela says going through life without
OL,16,Fthem "doesn't make any sense".
OL,18,F"It should, you'd think, get easier
OL,19,Fbut it doesn't. It doesn't get
