OL,6,FA prosecutor has ruled out claims of a
OL,7,Fmechanical failure in a fatal
OL,8,Fcollision near the Humber Estuary
OL,9,Fwhich left a crew member dead.
OL,11,FJurors in the trial of a ship captain
OL,12,Fwere told: "The only thing not working
OL,13,Fwas the man in the dock."
OL,15,FRussian national Vladimir Motin had
OL,16,Fbeen on sole watch duty when the
OL,17,Fcontainer ship Solong crashed into the
OL,18,FStena Immaculate tanker anchored near
OL,19,Fthe Humber Estuary, killing Mark
OL,20,FAngelo Pernia, 38, who was on the bow.

OL,6,FIn his defence, Motin, 59, said he
OL,7,Fmade a "mistake" and pressed the wrong

OL,10,Ffrom the Stena Immaculate from one

OL,13,FNot realising the error, he told
