OL,7,Finsulation installed through a
OL,8,Fgovernment scheme say they are facing
OL,9,Fthousands of pounds of repairs and the
OL,10,Fprospect of being unable to sell their
OL,11,Fhome.
OL,13,FNorma Galley, from Knaresborough,
OL,14,FNorth Yorkshire, and her husband spent
OL,15,F#4,000 to part-fund spray foam
OL,16,Finsulation in their roof under the
OL,17,FGreen Homes grant scheme. The
OL,18,Fgovernment covered the rest of the
OL,19,Fcost.
