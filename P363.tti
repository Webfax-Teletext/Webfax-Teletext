OL,6,F"Diccan is part of the Long Churn Cave
OL,7,F/ Alum Pot system and access to the
OL,8,Ffirst pitch is by a traverse, meaning
OL,9,Fthat someone standing at the top
OL,10,Fcannot see down it. Fearing that their
OL,11,Fteam-mate might be suspended on the
OL,12,Frope, the group called for help.
