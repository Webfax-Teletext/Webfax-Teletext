OL,6,FSimon Cartwright, the fire
OL,7,Finvestigation officer for Lincolnshire
OL,8,FFire and Rescue, told the inquest that
OL,9,Fthe blaze started in the rear of the
OL,10,Fcaravan.
OL,12,FMr Cartwright told the court: "Lee was
OL,13,Fknown to smoke cigarettes. There was
OL,14,Fno evidence of smoking materials found
OL,15,Finside or outside the caravan,
OL,16,Fhowever, this could be due to the

OL,19,FMr Baker had been seen smoking on the

OL,21,Fto bed hours before the fire.

OL,6,FMr Cartwright said the "severity and

OL,8,Fcan "significantly hinder the ability
