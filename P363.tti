OL,6,FThe recruitment process to find a new

OL,8,Fhas started again, five months after
OL,9,Fthe force failed to receive a single
OL,10,Fapplication for the role.
OL,12,FThe position has been held temporarily
OL,13,Ffollowing the sudden retirement of
OL,14,FPaul Anderson on 25 June, less than a
OL,15,Fyear after he took up the role.
OL,17,FThe following day, the Independent
OL,18,FOffice for Police Conduct confirmed Mr
OL,19,FAnderson was being investigated over
OL,20,Falleged misconduct in relation to his
OL,21,Fbehaviour towards colleagues.

OL,6,FThe Police and Crime Commissioner
OL,7,FJonathan Evison then revealed the OPCC
OL,8,Fhad received "details of potential
OL,9,Fmisconduct" relating to Mr Anderson on
OL,10,F12 June, and had referred the matter
OL,11,Fto the IOPC on 24 June.
OL,13,FThe PCC is responsible for holding the

OL,17,FMr Evison later said he accepted his
OL,18,Fchief constable's retirement despite
OL,19,Fthe IOPC investigation because it was
OL,20,Fcheaper than suspending him.
