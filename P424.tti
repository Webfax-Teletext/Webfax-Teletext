OL,6,FOutside the ground, fans weren't
OL,7,Foptimistic about securing a ticket or
OL,8,Fgetting there, even if they do.
OL,10,F"We're members and we find it hard
OL,11,Fenough to get tickets to the matches
OL,12,Fhere, so I think we're assuming that
OL,13,Fwe've not even a hope." said one fan.
OL,14,F"We'd love to, but it's too difficult
OL,15,Fto get tickets," agreed another.
OL,17,FAn ardent supporter from Norway was
OL,18,Fthe most confident, telling ITV Tyne
OL,19,FTees on Thursday: "There's flights all
OL,20,Fday long from Oslo to London, so
OL,21,Fthat's not a worry or an issue."
