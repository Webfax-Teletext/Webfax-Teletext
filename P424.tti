OL,4,CSycamore Gap tree
OL,6,FThe tree had stood there for around
OL,7,F200 years, and had become a landmark
OL,8,Fof the North East for locals and
OL,9,Ftourists alike.
OL,11,FAfter it was felled, members of the
OL,12,Fpublic came to the gap to pay tribute
OL,13,Fto the tree, some even laying flowers
OL,14,Fand painted stones in its memory.
OL,16,FIn December last year (2023), staff at

OL,19,Ffelled tree was showing "signs of

OL,4,CSycamore Gap tree
OL,6,FExperts have used a range of
OL,7,Ftechniques to try and cultivate life,
OL,8,Fincluding one known as 'budding'.
OL,10,FIt works by attaching a single bud
OL,11,Ffrom the original tree to a rootstock
OL,12,Fof the same species. The two graft
OL,13,Ftogether and are joined by
OL,14,Fcorresponding cuts in the material.
OL,16,FThis process, if successful would
OL,17,Fcreate genetically identical replicas
OL,18,Fof the original Sycamore Gap tree.
