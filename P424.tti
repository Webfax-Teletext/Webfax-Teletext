OL,7,FThe annual event sees mostly men and

OL,10,Ftheir hands on the small leather ball
OL,11,Fwhich doubles up as the winner's prize.
OL,13,F"The families who've come from
OL,14,FSedgefield all want to win the ball,"
OL,15,Fone spectator told ITV Tyne Tees this

OL,17,FSedgefield."
OL,19,FWith no teams and few rules - the ball

OL,18,F"I don't know what they expected it to

OL,11,Fhugs.
OL,13,F"(It) depends where you are," he
OL,14,Fexplained. "If you're up here during

OL,9,F"Especially when people in your family
