OL,12,F"We thought it was an absolutely

OL,14,FEnvironmental Partnership Manager,
OL,15,FLNER. "We do have these brownfield,

OL,17,Fthought what a wonderful idea to put

OL,19,Fsomething that is really beneficial to
OL,20,Fthe company and really beneficial

OL,9,FAlgacraft. "Where you can grow trees,

OL,11,Fnothing else grows, so this is the
OL,12,Fbest thing we can actually do."
OL,14,FA pilot phase of the project, on a
OL,15,Fsmall scale, tested whether algae
OL,16,Fcould grow in an outdoor UK climate
OL,17,Fwithout any artificial heating.
OL,19,FThe pilot was a success and further
