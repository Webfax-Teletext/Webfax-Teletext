OL,6,FA rip current - sometimes known as a
OL,7,F'rip-tide' is a powerful, narrow
OL,8,Fchannel of fast-moving water flowing
OL,9,Ffrom the shore out to the sea.
OL,11,FRip currents can move at speeds of
OL,12,Fover 5mph - often faster than a tide,
OL,13,Fwhich rises and falls slowly.
OL,15,FThey can occur on any beach with
OL,16,Fbreaking waves and are a leading cause
OL,17,Fof beach-related drownings, according
OL,18,Fto the Royal Life Saving Society.
