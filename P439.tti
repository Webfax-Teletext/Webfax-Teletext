OL,6,FA young woman from Wiltshire says she
OL,7,Fhas to spend hours on a drip nearly
OL,8,Fevery day after being bitten by a tick
OL,9,Fat the age of 19.
OL,11,FYasmin Watling, who is now 25, did not
OL,12,Fsee the tick itself but discovered an
OL,13,Fenormous red bullseye rash on her leg
OL,14,Fand realised she may have been
OL,15,Finfected with Lyme Disease.
OL,17,FShe went to the GP but says that,
OL,18,Funfortunately, she was prescribed the
OL,19,Fwrong antibiotics and so did not get
OL,20,Fthe timely treatment she needed.
