OL,12,FThe store in Helston mistakenly put up

OL,15,FWelsh for meat and poultry, instead of

OL,6,FSupermarket chain Tesco has since
OL,7,Fapologised for the mistake and says
OL,8,Fthe store has now removed the signage.
OL,10,FShoppers shared their amusement on
OL,11,Fsocial media, some wondering whether
OL,12,FCornish signs had ended up in Wales,
OL,13,Falso.
OL,15,FOne user said: "I like that someone

OL,19,Fthe implementation was a tad lacking."

OL,9,FDr Garry Tregidga, co-director of the

OL,6,FHe said: "This is obviously

OL,8,Fgreat if there was the intention to
OL,9,Fhave signs in Cornish. I hope there
OL,10,Fwill be replacement signs put up in

OL,13,F"What is also positive is that this

OL,16,Fare using and recognising Cornish.
OL,18,F"If anyone from Tesco needs assistance
