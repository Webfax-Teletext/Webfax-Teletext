OL,6,F"Red pandas are crepuscular, which
OL,7,Fmeans they are most active at dawn and
OL,8,Fdusk. Their red or orange-brown coat,
OL,9,Fwhite markings on their face, and
OL,10,Fbushy tails with red and buff ring
OL,11,Fpatterns, serve as a camouflage within
OL,12,Ftheir natural habitat amongst red moss

OL,15,F"They also have what's often described
OL,16,Fas an extra thumb, which is an
OL,17,Fenlarged, modified wrist bone which
OL,18,Fthey put to good use to climb trees
OL,19,Fand grab bamboo stems."
