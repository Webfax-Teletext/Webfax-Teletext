OL,6,FHe phoned a friend in the minutes

OL,8,Fwhen she returned his call.
OL,10,FWhen his parents, Catherine and Alan,
OL,11,Ffrom Flax Bourton, awoke after 5am and
OL,12,Frealised he hadn't come home, they
OL,13,Fused an app to see where he was.
OL,15,FThis showed Jack - or at least his
OL,16,Fphone - was in Granby Hill in
OL,17,FHotwells, a few streets uphill from
