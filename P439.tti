OL,6,FMalcolm Bell said: "I think the thing
OL,7,Fabout Easter is it gives you the first
OL,8,Ftaste of what the consumer is doing.
OL,10,F"It gives everybody an idea of the
OL,11,Fcost of living and other issues, and
OL,12,Fwhether the normal patterns are there
OL,13,For there's a nuance in them.
OL,15,F"Which helps you then decide on what
OL,16,Fyou can charge, or change in the menu.
OL,17,FSo it's a good boost of money, but
OL,18,Fit's a good litmus test of where the
OL,19,Fconsumer is."
