OL,6,FA Somerset community group's bid to
OL,7,Fsave its Grade II listed local pub has
OL,8,Fbeen called off after a failure to
OL,9,Fraise the necessary funds.
OL,11,FThe Milverton Community Benefit
OL,12,FSociety (MCBS) was set up with the
OL,13,Fgoal of acquiring the freehold of The
OL,14,FGlobe Inn - after its owners struggled
OL,15,Fwith declining visitors and profits.
OL,17,FHowever, the group has now dropped its
OL,18,Fcampaign - citing an inability to
OL,19,F"raise the necessary funds to make a
OL,20,Fviable offer to the current owners".

OL,13,FThe community group will now focus
