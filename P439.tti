OL,6,FThe chair of NHS Devon has resigned,
OL,7,Fsaying she "did not feel able to sign
OL,8,Foff on a further cut" as the budget
OL,9,Ffor local health services is "already
OL,10,Fstretched too far."
OL,12,FDr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP and
OL,13,FConservative MP, was appointed chair
OL,14,Fof the Integrated Care System for
OL,15,FDevon in December 2021.
OL,17,FShe wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that
OL,18,Fshe was "genuinely sad" to be leaving
OL,19,Fand thanked staff for doing their
OL,20,F"very best in challenging
OL,21,Fcircumstances."
