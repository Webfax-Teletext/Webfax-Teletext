OL,8,Fdiscuss the water parasite outbreak in

OL,10,Fquestions unanswered.
OL,12,FSWW bosses - including Chief Executive
OL,13,FSusan Davy - faced a series of

OL,6,FIt has been nine weeks since the last

OL,8,Ftap water was safe to drink following
OL,9,Fthe discovery of the parasite in May.
OL,11,FCaroline Voaden, the Liberal Democrat
OL,12,FMP for South Devon, said residents
OL,13,Fhave had to wait too long to put their
OL,14,Fquestions to Ms Davy, but hopes there
OL,15,Fwill be progress in the coming months.
OL,17,FSWW said it was "truly sorry" for the

OL,19,Flocal people and business.

OL,6,FOne man who attended the meeting said
OL,7,Fwhile he recognised Ms Davy's apology,
OL,8,Fhe felt she didn't gage the strength
OL,9,Fof feeling from local people about the
OL,10,Fimpact of the incident.
OL,12,F"Ms Davy's main job there tonight was
OL,13,Fto apologise unreservedly. What she
OL,14,Fdidn't do is understand the actual
OL,15,Ffeeling of the anger and the distrust
OL,16,Ftowards South West Water," he said.
OL,18,FAnother resident who attended the
OL,19,Fmeeting said she felt "lots of
OL,20,Fquestions were left unanswered."

OL,12,FMs Voaden said she believed Brixham is

OL,15,FShe said: "If they find that the cause
