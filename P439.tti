OL,6,FA mum from Devon, Lauren Ewings, 27,
OL,7,Fwent into her Tesco Superstore to buy
OL,8,Fparacetamol and cat food but within
OL,9,Fhalf an hour of entering the store,
OL,10,Fshe had given birth.JLauren said she
OL,11,Fwoke up on Monday (22 January) in some
OL,12,Fpain but had assumed they were false
OL,13,Flabour pains. After dropping her
OL,14,Feldest child off at school, she made
OL,15,Fwhat she thought would be a quick trip
OL,16,Fto the Tesco Superstore in Tiverton.
OL,17,F"As I was walking into the store, my
OL,18,Fwaters went", she said.
