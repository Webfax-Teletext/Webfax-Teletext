OL,7,FA Bristol woman has described her
OL,8,Fanger and disbelief on discovering her
OL,9,Flate father's favourite tree had been
OL,10,Fstolen from his allotment.
OL,12,FMelanie Mason, from Redfield, gave her
OL,13,Ffather Richard the tree over two
OL,14,Fdecades ago and it flourished on his
OL,15,Fplot at Netham Allotments.
OL,17,FAfter Richard passed away from
OL,18,FAlzheimer's two years ago, the potted
OL,19,Ftree moved onto his wife Cynthia's
OL,20,Fplot - number eight - on the same site.

OL,7,FBut around 30 January this year, it

OL,12,FShe said: "It's just me and mum, and
OL,13,Fshe's got Alzheimer's too now. I know
OL,14,Fit sounds silly, but that tree is
OL,15,Fsomething we've always associated with
OL,16,FDad.
OL,18,F"The theft has had a real impact on

OL,21,Fthinks it's somewhere else.

OL,13,F"The annoying thing was, I was just

OL,18,FShe added that she could not imagine
