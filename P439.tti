OL,6,FHe said the purpose of the protest was
OL,7,Fto highlight the harm being caused to
OL,8,Fthe industry by cheap foreign imports,
OL,9,Fincluding what he claimed was Russian
OL,10,Fgrain, which farmers believe is

OL,13,Fresponse Portbury Docks said it wasn't
OL,14,Fdealing with any Russian grain.
OL,16,FMr Godden added: "We would much rather
OL,17,Fbe at home and with our families than
OL,18,Fdoing this, but if we are going to be
OL,19,Fpushed to breaking point this is what
OL,20,Fis going to happen.
