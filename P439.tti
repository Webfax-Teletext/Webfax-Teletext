OL,7,FCampaigners have said they will fight
OL,8,Fplans for a floating seaweed farm on
OL,9,Fthe North Cornwall coast.
OL,11,FBiome Algae Ltd and Camel Fish want to
OL,12,Fharvest seaweed in Port Quin Bay, near
OL,13,FPort Isaac as a sustainable
OL,14,Falternative to animal feed and
OL,15,Ffertiliser.
OL,17,FThe proposed farm would cover around
OL,18,F250 acres of the bay.

OL,13,FBarnaby Kay, one of the group's
