OL,6,FBanned taxi drivers from Weston-super-

OL,8,Flicence, according to councillors.
OL,10,FWeston-super-Mare councillors have
OL,11,Fwarned that banned taxi drivers have
OL,12,Fbeen getting their licences in
OL,13,FWolverhampton instead, and then
OL,14,Freturning to the town for work.
OL,16,FAccording to law, taxi drivers can
OL,17,Ftechnically be licensed in any local
OL,18,Fauthority - regardless of where the
