OL,10,Fthe earliest starts for the grass
OL,11,Fpollen season in the UK and the

OL,5,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,6,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,7,Fgrasses and weeds to fertilise other
OL,8,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,9,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,10,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.
OL,12,FThe immune system normally defends the
OL,13,Fbody against harmful invaders, such as
OL,14,Fviruses and bacteria, to ward off
