OL,6,FA recent increase in sightings of

OL,13,FThe Seahorse Trust welcomes the rise

OL,6,FMr Garrick-Maidment said: "There are
OL,7,Fdefinitely more sightings now, but I
OL,8,Fput a lot of it down to the fact that
OL,9,Fpeople are more aware of what we're
OL,10,Fdoing and where to report them.
OL,12,F"People are definitely much more
OL,13,Fnature aware than they used to be
OL,14,Fyears ago and they want to help out,
OL,15,Fthey want to send us sightings.
OL,17,F"We've got to be very cautious to say
OL,18,Fthere are more seahorses, but there's
OL,19,Fdefinitely more awareness of seahorses
OL,20,Fand people knowing when to report
OL,21,Fthem, which is great news.

OL,6,F"Good divers are great for us because
OL,7,Fif they accidentally come across a
OL,8,Fseahorse, they take a photograph,
OL,9,Fwithout flash, I have to add, because

OL,15,FMr Garrick-Maidment said the
