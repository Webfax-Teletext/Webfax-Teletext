OL,7,FOne resident, Roger Davies, has
OL,8,Fidentified a brook that runs alongside
OL,9,Fhis property, which he says is being
OL,10,Fpolluted.
OL,12,FRoger believes it is due to a blocked
OL,13,Fup ditch.
OL,15,F"This is a channel that runs under the
OL,16,Froad and to a pool that has been built
OL,17,Fdeliberately there to absorb the
OL,18,Fwater. But because it's been blocked,
OL,19,Fit carries on down the road into the
OL,20,Fbrook and then fills up the Sherbourne
OL,21,FLakes," he said.

OL,15,FEnvironmental campaigners say that

OL,18,Fmeaning the addition polluted

OL,7,FDebbie Campbell from the Cotswold

OL,11,Fpollution that comes from the water
OL,12,Fcompanies, and also we've got water
OL,13,Fthat just literally comes gushing down
OL,14,Fat such a rate and it's just basically
OL,15,Fpicking up microplastics.
OL,17,F"It picks up oil and all those things
OL,18,Fand silt that all comes gushing into

OL,13,F"Unfortunately, agricultural pollution

OL,16,F"There's a huge focus, quite rightly,
