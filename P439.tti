OL,7,F"These long-stay cats have been

OL,9,Fforever home and we are now desperate

OL,11,Fdeserve.
OL,13,F"They were living on the streets
OL,14,Fbefore they came into the cattery so
OL,15,Fall they want is a cosy bed, a comfy
OL,16,Fsofa and a warm lap to call their own.
OL,18,F"These three have been previously
OL,19,Foverlooked and we're not really sure
OL,20,Fwhy as each of them would make a
OL,21,Ffantastic companion."
