OL,8,Fseveral young girls in the Bristol and
OL,9,FDorset area between 2003-2009. The

OL,11,Fand 14 years old at the time of the
OL,12,Fincidents.
OL,14,FIn a personal statement, one victim
OL,15,Fsaid: "It is still in my head now. I
OL,16,Fremember it like it was yesterday. It
OL,17,Fis hard to let what happened to me go
