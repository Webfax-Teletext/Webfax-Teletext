OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV West Country, Mr McCoy
OL,7,Fsaid: "I think the Cheltenham Gold Cup
OL,8,Fthis year is the most amazing race and
OL,9,Flook, it's so hard to win.
OL,11,F"Cheltenham is, like any big sporting

OL,6,F"He has bought a lot of horses trying
OL,7,Fto win the Gold Cup and Synchronised's
OL,8,Fmum was called Mayasta. (It) was the
OL,9,Ffirst horse I ever rode from them, it
OL,10,Fwon in 1996 in Punchestown, and
OL,11,FMayasta bred Synchronised. So, his
OL,12,Fwife, Noreen, actually bred him his
OL,13,Fonly Gold Cup winner.
OL,15,F"So, there was a lot of history with
