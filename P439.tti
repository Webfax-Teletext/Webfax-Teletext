OL,11,FIn the winter of 2021, the Hope
OL,12,FMonument took a hit from a tree branch
OL,13,Fand was knocked off its plinth.
OL,15,FIt was made in tribute to Anne
OL,16,FNielson, who died in 1860 at the age
OL,17,Fof 23. At the time, it gave hope to
OL,18,Fthose who knew her that she had gone
OL,19,Fon to a better place.

OL,11,FLecturers Paul Maggs and Steve Shute

OL,6,FExcited to have the monument back, Ann

OL,9,Ffrom Arnos Vale for over a year. Bath
OL,10,FCollege very kindly used it as a bit
OL,11,Fof a training piece although some of
OL,12,Fthe key leads over there got quite
OL,13,Finvolved.
OL,15,F"They very kindly did this for free.
OL,16,FOf course, there's the cost of the
OL,17,Fscaffolding and people's time, which
OL,18,Fwe've had donations through for, which
OL,19,Fwas absolutely marvellous. But we were
OL,20,Fable to do this very cost-effectively."

OL,6,FThe statue depicts hope as a woman -
OL,7,Fwith an anchor at her feet, a symbol
OL,8,Fof faith in Christ. She is in chains -
OL,9,Fbroken to show her life cut short but
OL,10,Fset free in the hope of eternal life.
OL,12,FThe stone masons were able to replace
OL,13,Fher fingers, mend part of her chain
OL,14,Fand also part of the anchor.

OL,6,FAnn Fiddler added: "She's made of
OL,7,Fmarble, which can make her slightly
OL,8,Ffragile as an outside statue. And we
OL,9,Fcan see that part of her chain has
OL,10,Fbeen repaired, and there is a

OL,15,FOn Friday 24 January 2025, Hope was
OL,16,Freturned to her original place on her
OL,17,Fplinth in the cemetery. It was a
