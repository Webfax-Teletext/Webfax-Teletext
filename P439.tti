OL,6,FAn 'iconic' Giant Redwood tree in
OL,7,FExeter has been deemed unsafe and will
OL,8,Fhave to be felled.
OL,10,FThe Sequioadendron giganteum ` also
OL,11,Fknown in the UK as a 'Wellingtonia' or
OL,12,FGiant Redwood ` measures 23 metres in

OL,16,FTree experts at Exeter City Council
OL,17,Fsay it has noticeably deteriorated
OL,18,Fover the last year with 95% of the
OL,19,Fleaves turning brown so it is now
OL,20,Fbeyond saving.
