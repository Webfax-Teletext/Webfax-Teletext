OL,7,Fsignificantly impacted by technical

OL,10,FThe problems were evident from the    
OL,11,Fstart when viewers were greeted by a VT
OL,12,Fclock and audio from a report on the  
OL,13,Flead story. We then briefly saw some  
OL,14,Fvideo of the lead report, largely minus

OL,6,FTo compensate for the loss of some    
OL,7,Fvideo packages, the presenter recapped
OL,8,Fthe lead story verbally at the end of 
OL,9,Fthe programme and informed viewers that
OL,10,Fa full report was available online.   
OL,12,FHowever, the programme still finished a
OL,13,Fminute earlier than planned. The spare
OL,14,Ftime was filled by displaying the end
