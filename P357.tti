OL,4,FAfter a few days based in a temporary
OL,5,FCSO set, tonight's edition of An La saw
OL,6,Fthe programme return to an updated
OL,7,Fversion of its main set.
OL,9,FThe back panels of the set previously
OL,10,Fincluded one large TV screen and two
OL,11,Ffixed images at either side. The panels
OL,12,Fhave now been entirely replaced  but
OL,13,Flook very similar to what went before.
OL,15,FA key difference is that we now have
OL,16,Fthree large TV screens within the
OL,17,Fpanels, with the ability to display
OL,18,Fimages sent through from the gallery.
OL,20,FThe oval/rectangle desk has been
OL,21,Freplaced with a smaller circular desk.

OL,4,FThe programme's theme tune has also
OL,5,Fundergone a minor update.
OL,7,FThe BBC's Northern Irish radio stations
OL,8,Fhave this evening switched to the new

OL,10,Fmedia accounts.
OL,12,FBBC Radio Ulster moved first. BBC Radio
OL,13,FFoyle followed later, after 9pm.
OL,15,FFoyle's large profile images seem to be
OL,16,Fout-of-step with the Chameleon branding
OL,17,Fused for Ulster. Hopefully just a
OL,18,Ftemporary blip.

OL,4,FUPDATE: by Friday evening, BBC Radio
OL,5,FFoyle had updated its large profile
OL,6,Fimages with to reflect the new
OL,7,FChameleon branding.
OL,9,FMonths after it was replaced, the old
OL,10,FBBC News patch logo lives on in the
OL,11,FDateline London opening titles.
OL,13,FPresumably the patch logo is burnt on
OL,14,Fto the title sequence, rather than
OL,15,Fadded live.
OL,17,FOne of the BBC's longest-running and
OL,18,Fmost internationally respected news
OL,19,Fprogrammes, Dateline London is to due
OL,20,Fto air its final edition at the end of

OL,16,FThere was a similar issue this evening
