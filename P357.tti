OL,6,F"It is very rare and only one in 100
OL,7,Fchildren in the UK every year. The
OL,8,Fsymptoms are so generic that they
OL,9,Fwould just get passed off as viruses
OL,10,Fand infections.
OL,12,F"If you think your child's poorly and
OL,13,Fyou're not getting the answers you
OL,14,Fwant, just keep pushing it, keep
OL,15,Fpushing it until you get a diagnosis.
OL,16,FBecause unfortunately it could have
OL,17,Fbeen too late for Myles. But luckily
OL,18,Fwe got a diagnosis in the end."
