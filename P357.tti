OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV Border, Linda, said:
OL,7,F"I think Sally has come on leaps and

OL,10,F"She was totally shut down when she
OL,11,Fcame here and she could hardly walk
OL,12,Fand two weeks later she is happy to go
OL,13,Fout with up to 35 minutes per walk.
OL,15,F"She's happy, she still has a way to
OL,16,Fgo yet but we are getting there slowly
OL,17,Fbut surely. She is a beautiful dog and
OL,18,FI am just glad we have had her."

OL,12,Fgoing into home environments before we
OL,13,Fre-home them.
OL,15,F"So if we do not have those foster
OL,16,Ffamilies then we can not get the dogs
OL,17,Ffrom the stray pounds. We currently
OL,18,Fhave 11 foster families and have seven
OL,19,Fdogs out at those homes.
