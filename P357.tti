OL,6,GOfcom's proposals to remove some of
OL,7,Gthe limits on advertising on ITV 1,
OL,8,GChannel 4 and Channel 5 seem to
OL,9,Gstrike a sensible compromise.
OL,11,FTheir preferred way forward removes
OL,12,Fadditional restrictions on the
OL,13,Foverall volume of adverts and the
OL,14,Fmaximum length of breaks.
OL,16,FBut the tighter rules on the number
OL,17,Fof breaks within programmes would
OL,18,Fstay.
OL,20,FSo what might this mean in practice?
OL,3,CWhat would a change of PSB ad rules

OL,6,FIt is worth focusing on ITV 1 simply
OL,7,Fbecause its audience is so much
OL,8,Fbigger than the other two channels.
OL,10,FOfcom has noted, as we have discussed
OL,11,Fbefore, that the main impact will be
OL,12,Fon the 6pm and 10pm News hours.
OL,14,FThey would be able to include a full
OL,15,F12 minutes of ads.
OL,17,FDuring the daytime, the 7am, 8am,
OL,18,F10am, 1pm and 2pm hours could see a
OL,19,Fslight rise in advertising. Typically
OL,20,Fthey have 10 minutes 30 seconds worth
OL,21,Fjust now.

OL,6,FBut this could all be achieved by
OL,7,Fmaking the existing breaks longer `
OL,8,Fnot by additional interruptions.
OL,10,FFor instance the 10am and 1pm hours
OL,11,Fhave three breaks of 3 minutes 30
OL,12,Fseconds. They could potentially be
OL,13,Fextended to 4 minutes.
OL,15,FThe option of running longer internal
OL,16,Fbreaks could have pros and cons for
OL,17,Fviewers.
OL,19,FLonger internal breaks could mean
OL,20,Fbreaks between programmes could be

OL,6,FOfcom is also prepared to look at
OL,7,Fwhether to make no changes at all or
OL,8,Fallow a relaxation of the rule on the
OL,9,Fnumber of internal breaks.
OL,11,FThat could lead to two breaks during
OL,12,F30-minute programmes ` clearly
OL,13,Fsomething viewers would notice and
OL,14,Fsomething which could have an adverse
OL,15,Fimpact on the programme itself.

OL,6,FNo date has been announced for the
