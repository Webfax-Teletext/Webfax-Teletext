OL,6,FITV Border's Clare McNeill went to
OL,7,Fmeet Thomas to see how he's getting on
OL,8,Fafter his surgery
OL,10,FThomas the cockapoo came to Oak Tree
OL,11,FAnimals' Charity in Carlisle after his
OL,12,Fowner got ill and could no longer look
OL,13,Fafter him.
OL,15,FThe 9-month-old pup soon started to
OL,16,Flimp.
OL,18,FAfter a visit to the vet, they decided
OL,19,Fthat Thomas needed surgery that cost
OL,20,F#900 per hip, so the charity set up a
OL,21,FJust Giving page to raise the money.

OL,12,F"She was absolutely heartbroken, but

OL,6,F"We got him checked by the vets and we
OL,7,Fdid a bit more investigation and
OL,8,Fthat's when we got the X-rays done and
OL,9,Fit was found that he had hip dysplasia.
OL,11,F"Thomas had to get surgery, so we put
OL,12,Fan appeal out and did a fundraiser
OL,13,Fspecifically to fund that surgery.
OL,15,F"We had an unbelievable response", she
OL,16,Fadded.
OL,18,F"Within seven hours we hit the initial
OL,19,Ftarget and then the donations just
OL,20,Fkept on and so we ended up with over
OL,21,Fdouble, which is just unbelievable.
