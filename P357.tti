OL,6,FStuart Torrance, an insurance claims
OL,7,Fmanager at H&H, said: "The general
OL,8,Fadvice would be the same for all
OL,9,Fparties whether they are insured or
OL,10,Fnot insured really; when it is safe to
OL,11,Fdo so, gather as much evidence as you
OL,12,Fpossibly can - take photographs of any
OL,13,Fdamage, then assess and do a tally of
OL,14,Fwhat damage we are talking about."
OL,16,FHe continued: "If it is building
OL,17,Fdamage, make sure you do a full
OL,18,Fassessment and make sure we know which
OL,19,Fbuildings are affected and the extent
OL,20,Fof the damage.

OL,3,CInsurance advice issued for those
OL,4,Caffected by storm damage
OL,6,F"We have to see how bad the damage is
OL,7,Fand insurers have to know whether to
OL,8,Fappoint an adjuster or not.
OL,10,F"Generally in the industry we say for
OL,11,Fanything sub #5,000 they may not send
OL,12,Fan adjuster out, so it is really just
OL,13,Fgetting an estimate of the damage at
OL,14,Fthe premises."

OL,6,FHe said: "Secure any quotations from

OL,8,Fcontractors straight away, don't wait
OL,9,Ffor insurers. Get people on board, get
OL,10,Fpeople instructed and get to the front
OL,11,Fof the queue."
OL,13,F"People can check their own policy
OL,14,Fdocumentation, if they know they have
OL,15,Finsured through a broker then get in
OL,16,Ftouch with them.
OL,18,F"They will certainly be on hand to
