OL,7,FHidden behind houses is an unloved

OL,13,FPeople of all ages in the area have
OL,14,Fbeen coming together to reimagine the

OL,7,F"The community have come up with some

OL,9,Fwho are part of the skate park down at
OL,10,FStair Park - they would like to see a
OL,11,Fdirt track created!
OL,13,F"There's going to be little lake areas
OL,14,Fcreated and hopefully with a little
OL,15,Fpagoda in the middle that could be a
OL,16,Fbandstand or a meditation place.
OL,18,F"There's going to be footpaths that
OL,19,Fmeans that everybody can use them so
OL,20,Fit's going to be a space accessible
OL,21,Ffor everybody."

OL,12,F"SEPO, the Scottish Environment

OL,14,Fand improve our water quality, so
OL,15,Fthey've come to us and the council and
OL,16,Fsaid we'd like to help to restore this
