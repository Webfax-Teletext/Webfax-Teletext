OL,15,FIn response a Minister said: "The

OL,6,FOpponents have a number of concerns
OL,7,Fabout the proposed park, suggesting
OL,8,Fthat house prices could rise, and over
OL,9,Ftourism could put pressure on local

OL,16,FBut those in favour believe the
OL,17,FNational Park offers a once in a

OL,19,Fwhich could attract inward investment,
OL,20,Fextra Government funding and help look
