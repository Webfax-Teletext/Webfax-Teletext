OL,5,FPollen is a very fine powder produced
OL,6,Fby the male parts of trees, flowers,
OL,7,Fgrasses, and weeds to fertilize other
OL,8,Fplants of the same species. Many
OL,9,Fpeople have an adverse immune response
OL,10,Fwhen they breathe in pollen.
OL,12,FThe immune system normally defends the

OL,14,Fviruses and bacteria, to ward off
