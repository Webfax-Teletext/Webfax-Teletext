OL,6,FFor two weeks around 20 pupils at the
OL,7,F81-pupil-school have been kept at
OL,8,Fhome. But this week the parents set up
OL,9,Fan alternative "school" in the
OL,10,Fcommunity centre next door and are
OL,11,Fteaching pupils themselves.
OL,13,FThey are led by parent council
OL,14,Fchairwoman Rebecca Vasey, whose
OL,15,Fdaughter Izabella is a pupil. Speaking
OL,16,Fto Media Scotland she said: "There are
OL,17,Fabout 20 pupils who have been kept off
OL,18,Fbut the parents of many others are
OL,19,Fconcerned but have no choice but to
OL,20,Fsend their children to school."
