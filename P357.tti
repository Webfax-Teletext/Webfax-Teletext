OL,6,FThe company says that although the
OL,7,Fnumber of incidents of bad behaviour
OL,8,Frepresents a small proportion of many
OL,9,Ftrouble-free journeys, the risk of
OL,10,Fanti-social incidents is particularly
OL,11,Fhigh over the Christmas period.
OL,13,FCustomer service advisor Hannah Scott
OL,14,Fsaid that "you never really know what
OL,15,Fyou're going to be coming into each
OL,16,Fday", adding that anti-social and
OL,17,Fabusive behaviour has become something
