OL,7,FAlan explained the reasons behind what
OL,8,Fstarted the fire, he said: "We believe
OL,9,Fthat what happened was I had a power-
OL,10,Fbank in one of the far end sheds and
OL,11,Fit was being charged by solar panels
OL,12,Fand I think the battery management
OL,13,Fsystem has failed and allowed
OL,14,Felectricity to come into fully charged
OL,15,Fbatteries.
OL,17,F"They overheated, melted the plastic
OL,18,Fand then I believe it ignited which
OL,19,Fcaused the devastation."
