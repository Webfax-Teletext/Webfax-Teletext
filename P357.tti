OL,6,FCarlisle MP Julie Minns is continuing
OL,7,Fher campaign for a law banning the
OL,8,Fsale of illegal high-speed e-bikes.
OL,10,FThe Labour politician first introduced
OL,11,Fthe proposal as a 'ten minute rule
OL,12,Fbill', which allows backbench MPs to
OL,13,Fpropose a new Bill in a speech lasting
OL,14,Fno longer than ten minutes.
OL,16,FShe has since written to the business
OL,17,Fsecretary "demanding urgent action",
OL,18,Fhaving gained the backing of Cumbria's
OL,19,FPolice, Fire and Crime Commissioner,
OL,20,FDavid Allen, and 28 other police and
OL,21,Fcrime commissioners.
