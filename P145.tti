OL,6,FThe question over Freeview's long-term
OL,7,Ffuture is based on two issues:
OL,8,Fquestions over whether frequencies
OL,9,Fshould be turned over to other uses `
OL,10,Fsuch as improving mobile broadband `
OL,11,Fand the support of the broadcasters
OL,12,Ffor Freely.
OL,14,FFreely is dubbed the successor to
OL,15,FFreeview ` but would it not be better
OL,16,Fto describe it as an upgrade?
OL,18,FIt will be interesting to see how much
OL,19,Fdemand there actually is for Freely
OL,20,Fsets. At present set-top boxes are
OL,21,Funavailable.

OL,6,FHowever the idea of switching off
OL,7,FFreeview and actually replacing it
OL,8,Fwith Freely depends on one crucial
OL,9,Ffactor. Every home would need access

OL,13,FAnd even if that access existed, would
OL,14,Fsome people ` especially those who are

OL,16,Factually want it?
OL,18,FAdvances in consumer technology and

OL,21,Fwhich leaves some people behind.
