OL,6,FThe nature of digital TV and radio
OL,7,Fmeans there's at least several
OL,8,Fchannels running a comprehensive
OL,9,Fschedule through the night on most
OL,10,Fmultiplexes.
OL,12,FHowever, it's interesting to note
OL,13,Fthat many mobile networks ` some of
OL,14,Fwhich operate via the same masts as
OL,15,Fdigital TV services ` are turning off
OL,16,Fsites, reducing power and/or
OL,17,Fbandwidth during the night, as they

OL,6,FAs a result, it's possible that your

OL,8,Fmast after midnight, or the available
OL,9,Fbandwidth is reduced ` a move that
OL,10,Fwon't affect most users as there's
