OL,6,GA little look at the official BARB
OL,7,Gratings for August reveal that a
OL,8,Gsignificant moment in broadcasting
OL,9,Gmay not be far off.
OL,11,FChannel 5 is coming close to
OL,12,Fovertaking Channel 4 in terms of
OL,13,Faudience share.
OL,15,FIn August, C4 took 4.17% of viewing
OL,16,Fwhile C5 took 4.07%.
OL,18,FThere were many days when C5 was
OL,19,Fahead of C4 and it is thought the

OL,21,F"plus one" services are excluded.

OL,11,FNow, first of all, there are a number

OL,6,FC4 generally targets the younger

OL,8,FC5 has an increasingly clear focus on
OL,9,Fa maturer audience and is very
OL,10,Fdifferent to the trashy C5 of old.
OL,12,FIt's also important to remember that
OL,13,Fboth C4 and C5 have families of
OL,14,Fchannels. The share of C4's portfolio
OL,15,Fis still comfortably larger than C5's.
