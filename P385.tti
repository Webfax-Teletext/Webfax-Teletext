OL,6,FThe famous artist, J.M.W Turner, has
OL,7,Finspired a new walking trail in which
OL,8,Fcelebrates the sketches he did during
OL,9,Fhis time in the Bailiwick.
OL,11,FThe artist, whose name is used for the
OL,12,Fannual 'Turner Prize' given to British
OL,13,Fartists, spent time on the island in
OL,14,F1832, where around 100 sketches were
OL,15,Fmade to depict his stay in Guernsey.
OL,17,FFrames have been placed around the
OL,18,Fisland in the spots where Turner did
OL,19,Fhis sketches.

OL,6,FCurator of the walk, Jock Pettitt
OL,7,Fsays: "Those sketches offer us a lense
OL,8,Fof what Guernsey looked like in the
OL,9,F1830s and how that differs to today so
OL,10,Fwe've been having a lot of fun trying
OL,11,Fto locate the spots where he sketched."
OL,13,FThe paintings can now be found at the
OL,14,FTate Gallery in London but the mystery
OL,15,Fremains as to why he was in Guernsey.
OL,17,FArt for Guernsey, Jock Pettitt says:
OL,18,F"Things like Cholera were rife in the
OL,19,FUK at that time so maybe he was
OL,20,Fheading to the continent to escape
OL,21,Fthat.

OL,6,F"There are records of him in the
OL,7,Fsketchbook of him working in
OL,8,FHampshire, France and the Channel
OL,9,FIslands there's also an idea of the
OL,10,Froute he was taking.
OL,12,F"When you look at his work he's very
OL,13,Ffocused on built-up areas, there are
OL,14,Ffortifications, Castle Cornet, Vale
OL,15,FCastle, Fort George, the Coupee. All
OL,16,Fthese landmark places within the
OL,17,FBailiwick that he's covered."
OL,19,FThe Turner Trail covers 16 locations
OL,20,Facross the islands, including Town
OL,21,FChurch and bathing pools.

OL,7,Fprolific in general. You see with the
OL,8,Fminimal lines in his sketches, he was
