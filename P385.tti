OL,7,FMinister says he is "really concerned

OL,11,FDeputy Kirsten Morel wants to take a

OL,13,Foverseas businesses and those from
OL,14,Felsewhere on the island to move onto
OL,15,Fthe high street.
OL,17,FHe explains: "Obviously we're a small
OL,18,Fisland, we can't expect all retailers
OL,19,Faround the UK and Europe to know about
OL,20,FJersey so we need to go and talk to
OL,21,Fthem."

OL,6,FThe minister also wants businesses

OL,8,Ftheir stores on Sundays.
OL,10,FHe adds: "If you get off the boat for
OL,11,Fa day trip and very few shops are
OL,12,Fopen, it will make you question why.
OL,13,FIf you go to St Malo, pretty much all
OL,14,Fof them are open and there's a lot to
OL,15,Fdo. In Jersey, I think we need the
OL,16,Fcentre of town to provide that."
OL,18,FDeputy Morel believes regenerating the
OL,19,Ftown centre will play a big part in
OL,20,Fmaking it more attractive.
