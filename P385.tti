OL,6,FPeople in will pay 10% more for their
OL,7,Felectricity from July 2024.JThe
OL,8,Fincrease will be split between the
OL,9,Fcharge per unit and the fixed standing
OL,10,Fcharge - meaning higher bills will
OL,11,Fdepend on how much energy is used.
OL,12,FGuernsey Electricity say the hike will
OL,13,Fhelp meet rising costs and fund
OL,14,Finvestments in the network.
OL,16,FBefore applying to the increase to

OL,18,Fhave it approved by The States'

OL,6,FPresident of the STSB, Deputy Peter

OL,11,Felsewhere.
