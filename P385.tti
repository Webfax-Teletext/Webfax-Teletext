OL,3,CConcerns raised over suitability of

OL,6,FITV News has spoken to several
OL,7,Flifeboat crews, with the main concerns
OL,8,Fabout the new vessel being the
OL,9,Fdifferences in length and height of
OL,10,Fthe new boat compared to its
OL,11,Fpredecessor.
OL,13,FAs a 13-metre vessel, the Shannon
OL,14,Flifeboat is much smaller than the
OL,15,FSevern, which measures 17 metres.
OL,17,FTom Mansell, Regional Operations Lead
OL,18,Fat the Royal National Lifeboat
OL,19,FInstitution (RNLI), rejected such
OL,20,Fclaims when describing the new "state
OL,21,Fof the art" model.

OL,6,FHe explains: "The new Shannon-class is
OL,7,Fpowered by water jets, rather than
OL,8,Fpropellers, which means it can operate
OL,9,Fin shallow water. It's highly
OL,10,Fmanoeuvrable, and it can operate

OL,13,FThe roll-out of the new model forms

OL,15,Fwhich will see changes at twenty out
