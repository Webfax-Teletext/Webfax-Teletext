OL,10,FOpening on Tuesday 18 June, the

OL,12,Fdeciding to become self-sufficient in
OL,13,Ftheir London home.
OL,15,FBut rather than using a puppet to play
OL,16,Fthe Good family's goat, the production
OL,17,Fhas enlisted the help of 14-month-old
OL,18,FKit.

OL,10,FChris Bougourd, who plays Tom Good in

OL,12,Fof using a live farm animal.
OL,14,FHe explained: "The UK production used

OL,16,FGuernsey!

OL,6,FThe mild-mannered Kit is actually
OL,7,FGeraldine's understudy, as the
OL,8,Foriginal goat was 'butt out' after
OL,9,Fbeing, in Chris' words, "quite
OL,10,Fnaughty" with "a bit of an attitude".
OL,12,FMichelle Cox's daughter owns Kit. She
OL,13,Fexplained: "Chris said it would be
