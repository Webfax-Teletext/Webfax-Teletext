OL,16,FIt comes as Jersey Met issued a yellow

OL,19,FWhile it might look like a tornado,
OL,20,Fthe vortex cloud seen off Jersey's
OL,21,Fsouth coast is in fact a waterspout.

OL,6,FSpouts usually occur when cold air
OL,7,Fmoves across the water and there is a
OL,8,Flarge temperature difference between
OL,9,Fthe two.
OL,11,FThey are rotating columns of water and
OL,12,Fspray that are formed by whirlwinds
OL,13,Fover the sea and other bodies of water.
OL,15,FDespite appearances, they are usually
OL,16,Fsmall and weak, averaging around 50
OL,17,Fmeters in diameter.
OL,19,FWaterspouts travel at about 12 to
OL,20,F18mph, but mesocyclones, frequently
OL,21,Fseen in , can cause a danger to life.
