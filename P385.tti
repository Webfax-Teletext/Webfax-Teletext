OL,6,FThe phenomenon is called a 'mast year'
OL,7,F- but what is this and why does it
OL,8,Fhappen?
OL,10,FJohn Michel, from Jersey Trees for
OL,11,FLife, has some of the answers...
OL,13,FWhat is a 'mast year' and what are the
OL,14,Fsigns we are experiencing one here in
OL,15,Fthe Channel Islands?
OL,17,F"A mast year is when a particular
OL,18,Fspecies hugely increases its seed
OL,19,Fproduction for one season," says John.

OL,14,F'Mast years' affect all sorts of trees

OL,17,FThey tend to occur roughly every five

OL,6,F"Trees do this to confuse seed
OL,7,Fpredators," says John.
OL,9,F"Having a season with vastly more seed
OL,10,Fproduction ensures a surfeit of seeds
OL,11,Fwithout enough predators to eat them
OL,12,Fall, which in turn means some of the
OL,13,Fseeds can germinate and grow, in some
OL,14,Fcases going on to become full trees.
OL,16,F"It's very much an evolutionary trick

OL,6,FIt seems to be as though all the trees

OL,8,Fnormal, as they all do it at the same
OL,9,Ftime.
OL,11,FJohn says it is still unclear exactly
OL,12,Fhow tree species coordinate a 'mast

OL,15,F"It's one of nature's mysteries," he
OL,16,Fsays.
OL,18,F"However, there is research to suggest
OL,19,Fthat it's partly linked to weather the

OL,21,Fperhaps even more likely, drought."
