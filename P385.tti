OL,6,FThe Jersey government is facing
OL,7,Fcriticism for being "too reliant" on
OL,8,Fconsultants after a massive #111.8m
OL,9,Fspend, according to a review of their
OL,10,Fcurrent role in .
OL,12,FThe report by Jersey's Comptroller and
OL,13,FAuditor General was a follow-up into
OL,14,Fhow consultants were used on the
OL,15,Fisland and found the practice was "not
OL,16,Fvalue for money".

OL,6,FWhile the report said consultants can
OL,7,Fprovide great benefits when used
OL,8,Fcorrectly, misuse can drain budgets
OL,9,F"very quickly", stating has become too
OL,10,Freliant on consultants for non-major

OL,13,FThe report also found #111.8m was
OL,14,Fspent on healthcare consultancy from
OL,15,F2019 to 2022.
OL,17,FFor example, the Team Jersey project,
OL,18,Fdesigned to train more managers to
OL,19,Fmove away from consultants within the
OL,20,Fgovernment, ironically cost #1.8m in
OL,21,Fconsultancy fees.

OL,6,FDespite this, the Chief Minister also

OL,10,FHe explained: "We have to bring in
