OL,6,FJersey's Social Security Minister has
OL,7,Flodged proposals to radically overhaul
OL,8,Fthe benefits system for islanders with
OL,9,Flong-term health conditions, such as
OL,10,Farthritis, long Covid and chronic pain.
OL,12,FThe proposals aim to modernise the way
OL,13,Fin which illnesses and disabilities
OL,14,Fare financially assessed following
OL,15,Fcriticism that the current system is
OL,16,Foutdated and, at times, unfair.
