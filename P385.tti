OL,3,CDFDS Seaways ferry stuck in UK port as
OL,4,Cfirm takes over island ferry service
OL,6,FDFDS Seaways has taken over Jersey's
OL,7,Fferry services today (Friday 28
OL,8,FMarch), but an issue with licensing
OL,9,Fhas prevented one vessel from sailing.
OL,11,FIt was smooth sailing at first after
OL,12,Fthe Danish firm's first freight boat
OL,13,Ffrom the UK - Arrow - arrived at 5am
OL,14,Fas planned.
OL,16,FHowever, licensing issues with the
OL,17,FTarifa Jet, which is meant to run the
OL,18,Froute to St Malo, meant Friday's
OL,19,Fvoyage - as well as the 5:25pm sailing
OL,20,Fon Saturday 29 March - was cancelled.

OL,6,FIt means the Stena Vinga that arrived
OL,7,Ffrom Portsmouth at 6pm is the first
OL,8,Fpassenger ferry to reach Jersey under
OL,9,FDFDS.
OL,11,FThe Tarrifa Jet is currently in the
OL,12,FSouth of England, where it is
OL,13,Fundergoing a refit service.
OL,15,FWhilst there, DFDS decided to 're-

OL,17,Fa UK one.

OL,3,CDFDS Seaways ferry stuck in UK port as

OL,6,FHowever, this means the Maritime and
OL,7,FCoastguard Agency (MCA) had to
OL,8,Fundertake another assessment to allow
OL,9,Fthe Tarifa Jet to sail under a UK flag.
OL,11,FThe MCA identified that additional
OL,12,Fwork is needed and has detained the
OL,13,Fvessel until it's fit for service.
OL,15,FChris Parker, DFDS' route director for
OL,16,FJersey, explains: "It's really
OL,17,Fdisappointing. It's our first day, and
