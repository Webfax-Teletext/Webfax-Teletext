OL,10,FShaun and Carrie Tullier bought the

OL,12,Fisland in 2021.
OL,14,FAlthough they were aware it was built
OL,15,Fon a former gun emplacement, they had
OL,16,Fno idea about the extent of the
OL,17,Fstructure until a former owner's

OL,19,Fthere may be more to the site's story.

OL,15,FShaun explains: "When we first came

OL,17,Fbottles. I think it had been used for
OL,18,Frecycling, with people just throwing
