OL,6,FWhen Sir Lindsay, the Speaker of the

OL,9,Fme with the question, 'Should they
OL,10,Fhave an elected speaker?'.
OL,12,F"It's not for me, it's for the people
OL,13,Fof Jersey to decide. I always respect
OL,14,Fthe views of the people.
OL,16,F"I come to parliaments, I visit

OL,12,F"Theoretically, I've supported the
