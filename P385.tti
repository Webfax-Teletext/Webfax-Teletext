OL,6,FDecember is characterised by shorter
OL,7,Fdays and often wet and windy weather.
OL,9,FIt is also one of the chillier months
OL,10,Fof the year.
OL,12,FShorter daylight hours and more cloud
OL,13,Fcover mean less sunshine - just over
OL,14,Ftwo hours a day on average in December
OL,15,F- giving us colder days and chillier

OL,6,FDecember can therefore feel noticeably
OL,7,Fcolder than November or October.
OL,9,FHowever, the sea is still relatively
OL,10,Fmild at this time of year, which
OL,11,Fmitigates temperature cooling. This
OL,12,Fmeans December is rarely as cold as
OL,13,FJanuary or February.
OL,15,FA white Christmas is rare, but a wet
OL,16,Fone is more common.
