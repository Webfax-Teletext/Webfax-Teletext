OL,6,FParents in Jersey say they are having
OL,7,Fto consider leaving the island due to
OL,8,Fthe high price of childcare.
OL,10,FFull-time nursery fees are around
OL,11,F#23,000 a year for babies and toddlers
OL,12,Fup to the age of two, almost double
OL,13,Fthe average price in England, which is
OL,14,F#12,425.
OL,16,FMother Marijcke Klynsmith explains how
OL,17,Fhigh childcare costs were a key factor
OL,18,Fin her choosing to step away from her
OL,19,Fcareer: "It caused us to say, 'Ok,
OL,20,Flet's just stop work completely'".

OL,10,FMarijcke adds: "I think our long-term

OL,12,Fwe really love Jersey, but it's much

OL,13,FThe Government of Jersey currently
OL,14,Foffers 30 hours of free nursery
OL,15,Feducation every week in the year a
OL,16,Fchild turns four, during term time.

OL,11,F"In this day and age, a lot of those

OL,16,FThe Jersey Childcare Trust thinks this

OL,6,FExecutive Director Fiona Vacher says:
OL,7,F"I think parents are in a catch-22. Do
OL,8,Fthey return to work with the enormous
OL,9,Fcosts of childcare, or do they stay at
OL,10,Fhome for a little period of time and
OL,11,Fcare for their child, but face housing
OL,12,Fand other living costs as well? It's a
OL,13,Fvery difficult balance for them."
OL,15,FIn response, Deputy Andy Howell, the
OL,16,FAssistant Minister for Health and
OL,17,FSocial Services, says: "I do
OL,18,Funderstand for them it's a bit of a

OL,21,Fit better for people."
