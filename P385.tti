OL,4,Ccriteria for IVF treatment
OL,6,FNearly half of the Government's
OL,7,F#620,000 funding set aside for IVF
OL,8,Ftreatment in Jersey last year was not
OL,9,Fspent, according to one of the
OL,10,Fisland's Deputies.
OL,12,FDeputy Lucy Stephenson is now calling
OL,13,Ffor the unspent #280,000 to top up
OL,14,Fthis year's budget, so that more
OL,15,Ffamilies facing infertility can be
OL,16,Fhelped.
OL,18,FShe also argues the current benchmark
OL,19,Ffor accessing the funding is "overly-
OL,20,Frestrictive", and one of the reasons
OL,21,Ffor the significant underspend.

OL,6,FThe government pays for up to three
