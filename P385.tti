OL,6,FThe UK's largest airline, easyJet, is
OL,7,Fin talks with the States of Guernsey
OL,8,Fover running flights from the island's
OL,9,Fairport.
OL,11,FITV News understands the services

OL,15,FIt would be the first time the carrier

OL,13,FShe adds that bringing in more

OL,15,Fthe island is "the kind of

OL,6,FShe adds that while talks with easyJet

OL,6,FOne aviation expert says the move

OL,13,FChris Cairns states: "A lot of the
