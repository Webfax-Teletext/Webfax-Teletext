OL,10,FUp to September 2024, the Alderney
OL,11,FAsian Hornet Group has killed 101

OL,14,FThe group has also managed to destroy
OL,15,F17 nests, thanks to residents
OL,16,Freporting sightings on social media.
OL,18,FDespite their success, they are
OL,19,Fappealing to islanders for help to
OL,20,Fcatch more of these invasive insects.

OL,6,FDavid Jarolik, a volunteer from the
OL,7,FAlderney Asian Hornet Group says: "If
OL,8,Feveryone could at least check the
OL,9,Ftrees in their garden or look up while
OL,10,Fwalking (especially with a dog), it
OL,11,Fcould help significantly."
OL,13,FBut he stressed that if a nest is
OL,14,Funcovered, the public should "never"
OL,15,Fattempt to deal with it themselves, as
OL,16,Fthis could be "extremely dangerous".
OL,18,FInstead, they should contact the Asian
OL,19,FHornet Group directly, or speak to
OL,20,FGuernsey's Asian Hornet Team.
