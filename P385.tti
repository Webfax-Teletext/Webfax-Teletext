OL,8,Fwith many taking to social media to
OL,9,Fquestion what exactly they had seen.
OL,11,FEagle-eyed islanders shared photos and

OL,14,FSt Brelade and Corbiere, on Thursday

OL,6,FThey are often what occurs visually

OL,9,FWaterspouts
OL,11,FWaterspouts are funnel clouds that
OL,12,F"gradually stretch down to sea level",
OL,13,Faccording to Jersey Met.
OL,15,FSpouts tend to happen when cold air

OL,18,Fdifference between cold air and water.

OL,6,FThe vortex-shaped clouds are usually
OL,7,Fsmall and weak, with an average
OL,8,Fdiameter of 50 metres and approximate
OL,9,Fwind speeds of 50mph.
OL,11,FThe rotating columns of water and
OL,12,Fspray are created by whirlwinds over

OL,15,FSome social media users compared the

OL,11,FOne of the worst tornadoes that Jersey

OL,8,FBased on the footage and the reports

OL,13,FSome shots show the funnel making
