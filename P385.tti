OL,5,FDonna De Gruchy, the BDMLR Channel
OL,6,FIsland coordinator said: "Apart from
OL,7,Fthe leatherback in the summer months,
OL,8,Fall other turtles should not be in our
OL,9,Fcold seas.
OL,11,F"They would have accidentally been
OL,12,Fswept here on the currents from warmer
OL,13,Fwaters, maybe after a storm, or if
OL,14,Fthey were already in poor health, they
OL,15,Fmay have made a navigational error."
OL,17,FDonna continued :"If anyone finds a
OL,18,Fturtle on one of our beaches, they are
OL,19,Fasked to call the JSPCA animal animal
OL,20,Fshelter on 724331 and ask them to
OL,21,Fcontact us asap.
