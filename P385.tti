OL,6,FPeter Bott was a war baby. He grew up
OL,7,Fonly knowing life under the Occupation
OL,8,Fand the hardship that came with it.
OL,10,FPeter says: "I never wore a pair of
OL,11,Fshoes until I was six years old, so my
OL,12,Ffeet were like leather.
OL,14,F"I walked for six years without any
OL,15,Fshoes on and when we did, we had bits
OL,16,Fof leather and bits of cardboard cut
OL,17,Fup and strapped on our feet."
OL,19,FPeter and his other siblings grew up
OL,20,Fwith very little, and what they did
OL,21,Fhave was always shared amongst them.
