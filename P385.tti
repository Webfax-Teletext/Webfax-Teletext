OL,7,Fwith a unique tale to tell.
OL,9,FA few years ago, Boris had to have his
OL,10,Fback leg amputated at the vets after
OL,11,Fgetting gout.
OL,13,FHe has now been nursed back to full
OL,14,Ffitness by his owner, with a little
OL,15,Fhelp from a nifty bit of imagination -
OL,16,Fhis back leg was replaced by a Lego
OL,17,Fwheel so he could keep moving.

OL,6,FCollette Sloan, who adopted Boris from
OL,7,Fa local tortoise sanctuary after
OL,8,Fhaving his foot amputated, told ITV
OL,9,FNews: "He'd lost his leg and was just
OL,10,Fhad his wheel fitted when I took him
OL,11,Fon, so I still did a bit of nursing
OL,12,Fwith him but he did get his wheel off
OL,13,Fseveral times so we had to keep taking
OL,14,Fhim back to the vet but we've sorted
OL,15,Fthat out now.
OL,17,F"We tend to keep it on for a good year
OL,18,For two."

OL,6,FWhen asked why a Lego wheel was the
OL,7,Fperfect fit for Boris, Collette said:
OL,8,F"The size was just right; he just
OL,9,Fneeded something very little.
OL,11,F"When he first had it on he used it
OL,12,Flike a crutch and he sort of hopped
OL,13,Falong on it. He wasn't quite sure what
OL,14,Fto do with this alien piece of
OL,15,Fequipment.
OL,17,F"But slowly he just learned to use his
OL,18,Fthree legs and just wheel the wheel
OL,19,Falong as though it were a leg. I mean,
OL,20,Fhe's adapted fantastically and he gets
OL,21,Faround really well with it.
