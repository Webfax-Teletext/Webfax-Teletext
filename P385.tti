OL,6,FMr Wickings explains that while it is

OL,9,Fwith "shock and great disappointment".
OL,11,FHe says a new deal was being

OL,13,Fof the Executive Lounge - along with a
OL,14,Frebrand and upgrade - but that has now
OL,15,Ffallen through.
OL,17,FAlthough travellers can access the

OL,20,FWickings says the withdrawal of BA has
OL,21,Fmade it impossible to continue.
