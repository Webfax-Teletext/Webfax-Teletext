OL,6,F1. Pay growth weakens, closer to 3%,
OL,7,Fand one-off shocks like energy and
OL,8,Ffood costs fade - along with the
OL,9,Fheadline rate of inflation. That would
OL,10,Fgive the Bank of England room to
OL,11,Fgradually cut interest rates back to a

OL,14,F2. Pay growth remains strong, keeping
OL,15,Finflation elevated. In that scenario,
OL,16,Fthere would be little or no room to
OL,17,Fcut interest rates in the next year or
