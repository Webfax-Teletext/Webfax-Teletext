OL,7,FIt is thought by scientists that that
OL,8,F2.9 million whales were killed for
OL,9,Fcommercial purposes in the 20th
OL,10,Fcentury, driving many species to near
OL,11,Fextinction.
OL,13,FCommercial whaling was banned in 1986
OL,14,Fand since then populations around the
OL,15,Fworld have slowly been creeping back
OL,16,Fup.
OL,18,FHumpback whales have been the fastest
OL,19,Fto recover - they are nearly at pre-

OL,7,FThe iconic blue whale, the biggest

OL,10,Fprolifically during the last century
OL,11,Fthat the population of 42,000 in
OL,12,FAntarctic waters was decimated to just
OL,13,F3,000.
OL,15,FBut researchers are now sighting them
OL,16,Fmore often - a sign of a positive
OL,17,Fcomeback.
