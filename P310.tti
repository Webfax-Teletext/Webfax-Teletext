OL,6,FFor the second time in eight years
OL,7,FDonald Trump has delivered a political
OL,8,Fearthquake.
OL,10,FThis time it is even greater on the
OL,11,FRichter Scale. In 2016, Democrats
OL,12,Fplausibly argued it was a fluke. They
OL,13,Fnoted that he had lost the popular
OL,14,Fvote and had only secured the White
OL,15,FHouse because of the idiosyncrasies of
OL,16,Fthe Electoral College.

OL,6,FThere can no such argument this time.
OL,7,FTrump won the popular vote. It appears
OL,8,Fhe has won all seven battleground
OL,9,Fstates. He swept Florida and Texas by
OL,10,Fwide margins, which were expected to
OL,11,Fbe much more competitive races.
OL,13,FIt doesn't stop there. He made inroads
OL,14,Finto Democratic strongholds like New
OL,15,FJersey. He attracted significant
OL,16,Fsupport from young voters in the
OL,17,FMidwest and Black voters in Georgia.
OL,19,FRepublicans won control of the Senate.
OL,20,FThey may win the House.

OL,6,FIn other words, this was a sweeping

OL,9,FHe has faced four trails and nearly
OL,10,Fone hundred criminal charges. He was
OL,11,Fconvicted of multiple felonies in New

OL,14,FFurthermore, and even more
