OL,6,FKemi Badenoch has said the Tories will
OL,7,Fconsider means-testing the state
OL,8,Fpension triple-lock, in what would be
OL,9,Fa major policy shift for the party.
OL,11,FThe Conservative leader said that
OL,12,Fwhile in government the party had
OL,13,Fsupported the system, but that "we
OL,14,Fneed to make sure we are growing".
OL,16,FUnder the policy, the state pension
OL,17,Frises each year by whichever is
OL,18,Fhighest out of 2.5%, inflation, or
OL,19,Fearnings.

OL,9,F"No, we're going to look at means-

OL,13,FHowever, she criticised the Labour
