OL,3,CWhat's the difference between whooping

OL,6,FWhooping cough is a infection of the
OL,7,Flungs and airways. It is caused by
OL,8,Fbacteria called Bordetella pertussis,
OL,9,Fand is very contagious.
OL,11,FWhat are the symptoms?
OL,13,FThe first signs of whooping cough are
OL,14,Fsimilar to those of a cold, such as a
OL,15,Frunny nose and a sore throat.
OL,17,FSymptoms then progress after about a
OL,18,Fweek into coughing bouts lasting a few
OL,19,Fminutes, which might get worse at
OL,20,Fnight. Coughing can last for weeks or
