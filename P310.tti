OL,6,FI have a few more reflections to share
OL,7,Fon Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring
OL,8,FStatement that we'll hear on Wednesday.
OL,10,FThe first is that the Office for
OL,11,FBudget Responsibility is bound to make
OL,12,Fa gloomier forecast for real household
OL,13,Fdisposable income - a proxy for our
OL,14,Fliving standards - than even the
OL,15,Fpretty gloomy forecast it made in
OL,16,FOctober.
OL,18,FBack then, it said Real Household
OL,19,FDisposable Income (RHDI) would rise in
OL,20,Fthis parliament a paltry 0.5% a year
OL,21,Fon average.

OL,14,Fcut its forecast for next year from

OL,6,FI have two other facts to share.
OL,8,FThe first is that Reeves will only
OL,9,Fmake spending and welfare cuts that
OL,10,Frestore her eroded fiscal headroom of
OL,11,Fa short #9.9 billion, rather than
OL,12,Fincrease it.
OL,14,FThis is a pretty racy bet by her.
OL,15,FShe's taking a big economic and
OL,16,Fpolitical risk in not increasing
OL,17,Fheadroom to double or treble that.
OL,19,FThe point is that #9.9 billion is
OL,20,Falmost no buffer or headroom at all.

OL,6,FAid is classified largely as day-to-

OL,8,Fmuch of defence is capital. And since
OL,9,Fthe primary binding fiscal rule is to
OL,10,Fbalance day-to-day spending with tax
