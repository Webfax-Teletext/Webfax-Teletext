OL,6,FThe 4B movement emerged in South Korea
OL,7,Fin 2019. Its name comes from four
OL,8,Fwords all starting with "bi", the
OL,9,FKorean word for "no":
OL,11,FBihon means no heterosexual marriage,
OL,12,Fbichulsan is the refusal of
OL,13,Fchildbirth, biyeonae means no dating,
OL,14,Fand bisekseu refers to abstaining from
OL,15,Fsex.
OL,17,FThe 4B movement marked an attempt for
OL,18,Fwomen in South Korea to reject
OL,19,Fpatriarchy and misogyny, which they
OL,20,Fconsidered rampant in their society.
