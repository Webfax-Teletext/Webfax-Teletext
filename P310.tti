OL,6,FFinn Brennan, Aslef's full-time
OL,7,Forganiser on London Underground, said:
OL,8,F"We don't want to go on strike ` we
OL,9,Fdon't want to make travelling in and
OL,10,Faround the capital more difficult for
OL,11,Fpassengers and we don't want to lose a
OL,12,Fday's pay ` but we have been forced
OL,13,Finto this position because LU
OL,14,Fmanagement won't sit down properly and
OL,15,Fnegotiate with us.
OL,17,F"Our members voted by over 98% in
OL,18,Ffavour of strike action, but
OL,19,FUnderground management are still
OL,20,Frefusing to even discuss key elements
OL,21,Fof our claim.

OL,12,FAslef said a pay offer of 3.8%, plus a
