OL,6,FThe Defence Secretary has announced
OL,7,Fcuts to a number of military
OL,8,Fprogrammes in an effort to "modernise"
OL,9,Fthe army.
OL,11,FJohn Healey told the Commons on
OL,12,FWednesday he made the "difficult
OL,13,Fdecision" to scrap six military
OL,14,Fprojects, including a number of
OL,15,Fwarships, drones and helicopters.
OL,17,FJustifying the cuts, Healey said the
OL,18,Fplans are part of an effort to "make
OL,19,Four Armed Forces fit for the future",
OL,20,Fand to get "better value for money."
