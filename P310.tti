OL,6,FI said to Starmer these may well be
OL,7,Fseen as insufficiently ambitious in a
OL,8,Fcountry where living standards have
OL,9,Fstagnated for 16 years, where there is
OL,10,Fa risk of massive economic and social

OL,13,Fwhere we are at greater risk of being

OL,15,Fthan at any point since the second

OL,17,FLabour PM Gordon Brown points out -
OL,18,Frecord numbers of children live in

OL,3,CWhat's the point of Starmer's 'first

OL,6,FHis reply, paraphrased, was that it

OL,9,Fhopes of radical rehabilation and then
OL,10,Fdisappoint voters.
OL,12,FWhat he didn't say, but is presumably

OL,10,Feven if polling day is still six

OL,13,FStarmer knows that torpor and apathy
