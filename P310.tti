OL,5,CStatement
OL,7,FThe whole point about a general sales

OL,10,Fdomestically made goods and services.
OL,11,FIt is definitionally NOT a tariff. It
OL,12,Fis not discriminatory, least of all on

OL,15,FNow you would assume that no British
OL,16,Fgovernment would ever engage in trade
OL,17,Fnegotiations with another country on

OL,11,Ffactor in its determination of what it
