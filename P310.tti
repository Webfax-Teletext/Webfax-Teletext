OL,6,FChancellor Rachel Reeves has admitted
OL,7,Fthat there is "more to do" as her
OL,8,Fhistoric Budget speech was accompanied
OL,9,Fby disappointing growth forecasts.
OL,11,F"The growth forecasts today are
OL,12,Fcertainly not the summit of my
OL,13,Fambition," she told ITV's Peston
OL,14,Fprogramme.
OL,16,F"This is the first Budget of this
OL,17,Fparliament, is there more to do?
OL,18,FAbsolutely."

OL,6,FOne of the key areas both she and
OL,7,FPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pushed
OL,8,Fahead of the general election was
OL,9,Feconomic growth.
OL,11,FHowever, the Office for Budget
OL,12,FResponsibility's (OBR) forecast
OL,13,Fsuggests the increase in spending in
OL,14,Fthe Budget will only provide a

OL,6,F"There's often criticism of

OL,9,Fparliament, rather than long-term
OL,10,Fdecisions to put our country on a

OL,13,F"What the OBR say is that the long
OL,14,Fterm impact of the decisions we've
OL,15,Fmade today, particularly on
OL,16,Finvestment, will boost GDP by 1.4%.
OL,17,FThat's really welcome."
