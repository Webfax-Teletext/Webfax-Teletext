OL,6,FBy Daniel Boal, ITV News producer
OL,8,FThousands of mosquitoes are being
OL,9,Fdropped into Hawaii by drone in a bid
OL,10,Fto save an almost extinct species of
OL,11,Fbird.
OL,13,FThese aren't just any mosquitoes.
OL,15,FThe ones being dropped are non-biting,
OL,16,Flab-reared male mosquitoes which carry
OL,17,Fa bacteria meaning they cannot
OL,18,Fsuccessfully mate with wild female
OL,19,Fmosquitos.

OL,7,Fthe archipelago's invasive mosquito
OL,8,Fpopulation, which has decimated native
OL,9,Fbird populations including the rare
OL,10,FHawaiian honeycreepers.
OL,12,FThe birds play a central role in
OL,13,FHawaiian ecosystems as pollinators and
OL,14,Fseed dispersers.
OL,16,FAt one point, there were more than 50

OL,18,FHawaii, but today there are only 17
OL,19,Fleft, the majority of which are now

OL,6,FOne species, named the 'akikiki'

OL,10,FSpeaking to ITV News' US partner CNN,
OL,11,FDr Chris Farmer, Hawaii programme

OL,16,FThe insects thrive in tropical

OL,6,FScientists have successfully bred male
OL,7,Fmosquitoes in a lab that carry a
OL,8,Fstrain of naturally occurring
OL,9,Fbacteria, which causes non-viable eggs
OL,10,Fwhen they mate with wild females.
OL,12,FOver time, with repeated releases, the
