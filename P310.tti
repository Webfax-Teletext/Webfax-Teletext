OL,8,FEvery four years February gets an
OL,9,Fextra day and the quadrennial date
OL,10,Fcomes with lots of traditions and
OL,11,Fsuperstitions.
OL,13,FSo, how do people celebrate February
OL,14,F29, why do we have leap years, and
OL,15,Fwhat would happen if they didn't
OL,16,Fexist? ITV News explains.
OL,18,FWhat is a leap year?
OL,20,FIt takes around 365.25 days for Earth
OL,21,Fto orbit the Sun.

OL,6,FMost years this is rounded down to 365
OL,7,Fdays, but once every four years there
OL,8,Fis an additional day to make up for
OL,9,Fthose extra four quarters of a day.
OL,11,FThe end of February may seem like an
OL,12,Fodd day to tack on the extra 24 hours,
OL,13,Fbut it lines up with the end of the

OL,6,FLegend has it Irish Saint Bridget and

OL,8,Fcould take the reigns and propose to a

OL,10,Fshe complained that men were too slow
OL,11,Fto pop the question.
OL,13,FAnd the refusal of a Leap Day proposal
OL,14,Fcan get expensive. Historically in
OL,15,FIreland a rejected proposal has to be
OL,16,Fcompensated with a gift, typically in
