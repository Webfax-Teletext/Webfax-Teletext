OL,6,FAlthough it's worth saying that there
OL,7,Fare big questions in Birmingham today
OL,8,Fas the council claimed equal pay
OL,9,Fliability would hit #700m when they
OL,10,Fissued the section 114.
OL,12,FBut my sources suggest the payout to
OL,13,Fclaimants is #250m (the council nor
OL,14,Funions would confirm a number) with
OL,15,F#100m more to prevent future claims.
OL,17,FSo did they need to take such drastic
OL,18,Faction? The leader of the council,
OL,19,FJohn Cotton, argued to me today that
OL,20,Fthey did because equal pay wasn't the
