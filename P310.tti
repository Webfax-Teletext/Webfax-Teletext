OL,6,FLabour's amendment to the motion that
OL,7,Fcalls for a ceasefire in Gaza is
OL,8,Falmost identical to the SNP's original
OL,9,F- except in one material aspect,
OL,10,Fnamely that Labour does not accuse
OL,11,FIsrael of "the collective punishment
OL,12,Fof the Palestinian people".
OL,14,FBut in condemning any Israeli ground
OL,15,Finvasion of Rafah, and in pressing for
OL,16,Fa general immediate ceasefire, the SNP
OL,17,Fand Labour are now more-or-less in
OL,18,Flockstep.
OL,20,FThis carries a number of implications:

OL,6,F1) Since the Foreign Secretary Lord
OL,7,FCameron has also voiced deep concern
OL,8,Fabout a Rafah invasion, there is a
OL,9,Fquestion about whether the government
OL,10,Fcan simply vote against both the SNP

OL,12,Fdo nothing else.
OL,14,FThat could send a signal which is

OL,6,F3) In those circumstances, Labour and
OL,7,FStarmer would then face a dilemma.
OL,8,FWould Labour vote for the SNP's
OL,9,Funamended motion? Presumably it would
OL,10,Fsince its position on Gaza is now so
OL,11,Fclose to the SNP's.
OL,13,FBut Starmer and his colleagues will be
OL,14,Fwary of confirming in this way what is
OL,15,Fa plain truth (in any case), that the
OL,16,FSNP has been making the running on
OL,17,Fcalling for a ceasefire and Labour has
OL,18,Fbeen in its slipstream.
