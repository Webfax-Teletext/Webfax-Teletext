OL,6,FThere was a big production behind
OL,7,Flaunch of his "first steps": the
OL,8,Fentire shadow cabinet, assorted
OL,9,Factivists and Tory defectors were
OL,10,Fgathered in an Essex rehearsal studio
OL,11,Fthat was decked out in banners and
OL,12,Fprompt screens, and is more normally
OL,13,Fused for theatre rehearsals.JThe event
OL,14,Fitself consisted of speeches by five
OL,15,Fmembers of the shadow cabinet, a
OL,16,FLabour candidate and assorted real
OL,17,Fpeople - including deeply moving
OL,18,Ftestimony of teacher and cancer
OL,19,Fsufferer, Nathaniel Dye - plus the
OL,20,Fusual roster of filmed endorsements,
OL,21,Fincluding one from the boss of Boots
OL,22,Fthe chemist, Seb James.JAt the top of
OL,23,Fthe bill, of course, was Starmer
OL,24,Fhimself, roaming the central stage in
OL,25,Fa tieless, unbuttoned white shirt.

OL,6,FHe made himself a deliberate
OL,7,Fcounterpoint to his shadow ministers,
OL,8,Fwith their suits, Windsor Knots and
OL,9,Fsummer dresses. His informality was
OL,10,Fsaying "in this team, I make the

OL,13,FSo what was the point of the
OL,14,Fperformance? There were several.
OL,15,FFirst, he has shrunk his so-called

OL,19,FStarmer enters 10 Downing Street.

OL,6,FWhat he didn't say, but is presumably
OL,7,Falso on his mind, is that it's
OL,8,Fpointless taking big political risks
OL,9,Fwhen his party is so far ahead in the

OL,11,Fnot bad for him and his party that he
OL,12,F- from opposition - seems to be firing

OL,6,FStarmer wants to look like a PM in

OL,8,Freinforce that image, although there
OL,9,Fis a danger of hubris.JFinally, he
OL,10,Fneeds to find a way to sustain the

OL,13,Fis like one of those childhood car

OL,15,Faccompanied by the plaintiff cries of

OL,18,Fbe avoided at all costs.
