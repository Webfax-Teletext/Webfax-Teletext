OL,6,FThe Chancellor has plenty of
OL,7,Fheadaches: growth is weak, inflation
OL,8,Fis stubborn, the government's paying
OL,9,Fmore to borrow, and the welfare
OL,10,Fsavings it planned haven't
OL,11,Fmaterialised.
OL,13,FBut it's the prospect of an impending
OL,14,Fdowngrade to productivity growth by
OL,15,Fthe Office of Budget Responsibility
OL,16,F(OBR) that's really forcing her hand.
OL,18,FIt means she will have to find big
OL,19,Fsums of money.

OL,3,CWhy Reeves is acknowledging tax rises
OL,4,Care coming in the Budget
OL,6,FRachel Reeves has only been Chancellor
OL,7,Ffor a year. She can't be blamed for
OL,8,Ffifteen years of weak productivity
OL,9,F-but some will argue it's precisely
OL,10,Fbecause productivity has been weak for
OL,11,Fso long that she should have seen the
OL,12,Fdowngrade coming.
OL,14,FIn last year's Budget, she set new
OL,15,Frules for debt and borrowing, but left
OL,16,Flittle room for manoeuvre if things
OL,17,Fwent wrong.
OL,19,FShe gambled that the economy would
OL,20,Fpick up - and it hasn't.
