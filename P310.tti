OL,6,FA woman who was abused by Jeffrey
OL,7,FEpstein and groomed by his accomplice
OL,8,FGhislaine Maxwell, has told ITV News
OL,9,FUS Correspondent Dan Rivers that she
OL,10,Ffeels "violated".
OL,12,FThis report contains distressing

OL,15,FTeresa Helm doesn't like being
OL,16,Flabelled as a Jeffrey Epstein victim.
OL,17,FOr an Epstein survivor.
OL,19,FShe feels that having his name
OL,20,Fattached to hers defines her on his
OL,21,Fterms.
