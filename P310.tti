OL,7,FMr Khalidy said: "One of the most
OL,8,Fprominent obstacles is that there is
OL,9,Fno wheat to be ground now, and we are
OL,10,Fnow on the verge of famine. If no
OL,11,Fwheat, aid, or flour is brought in, we
OL,12,Fare on the verge of famine."
OL,14,FThe price of fuel has been another
OL,15,Fobstacle in running the mill.
OL,17,F"We're working on diesel. If it is
OL,18,Favailable in the black market, a 20-

OL,20,Fwhich is approximately thirty shekels
