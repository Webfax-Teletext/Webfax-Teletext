OL,6,FElijah J. Magnier, a senior political

OL,9,FHezbollah and survivors of Tuesday's
OL,10,Fpager attack. He said the pagers were
OL,11,Fprocured earlier this year.
OL,13,F"The pagers functioned perfectly for

OL,15,Fsuggesting that an error message sent
OL,16,Fto all the devices triggered the

OL,6,FBased on his conversations with

OL,8,Fsaid that many pagers didn't go off,
OL,9,Fallowing the group to inspect them.
OL,10,FThey came to the conclusion that three
OL,11,Fto five grams of a highly explosive
OL,12,Fmaterial were concealed or embedded in

OL,15,FHezbollah already changed their

OL,18,Fsuggests the group will now have to
