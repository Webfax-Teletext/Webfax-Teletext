OL,6,FSupermoons occur when a full moon is
OL,7,Fclosest to the Earth in its orbit,
OL,8,Fmeaning it appears larger and brighter
OL,9,Fthan other full moons.
OL,11,FThis is because the moon's orbit
OL,12,Faround the Earth is not perfectly
OL,13,Fcircular.
OL,15,FAs it completes its 27-day cycle

OL,17,Fthere is a point where the moon is
OL,18,Fclosest to the Earth, known as the

OL,11,FThe Earth usually sees one full moon a
