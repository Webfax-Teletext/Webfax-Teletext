OL,7,FUS Vice President Kamala Harris has
OL,8,Fcalled demands for Ukraine to give up

OL,10,Funacceptable" during a meeting with
OL,11,FPresident Volodymyr Zelenksyy.
OL,13,FIt comes after suggestions from
OL,14,FRepublican presidential candidate and
OL,15,FFormer President Donald Trump that
OL,16,FUkraine should quickly cut a deal to
OL,17,Fend the war.
OL,19,F"They are not proposals for peace,"
OL,20,FHarris said. "Instead they are
OL,21,Fproposals for surrender."
