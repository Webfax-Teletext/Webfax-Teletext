OL,6,FJames Cook University researcher
OL,7,FProfessor Angus Emmott, who helped
OL,8,Fwith the identification, said it is
OL,9,Fsuspected to be Australia's heaviest
OL,10,Finsect.
OL,12,F"There are longer stick insects out
OL,13,Fthere (in the region), but they're
OL,14,Ffairly light-bodied," he said.
OL,16,FProfessor Emmott and his colleagues
OL,17,Fsuspect that this stick insect species
OL,18,Fhas not been discovered until now
OL,19,Fbecause its habitat is simply too
OL,20,Fdifficult to access.

OL,6,F"It's restricted to a small area of
OL,7,Fhigh-altitude rainforest, and it lives
OL,8,Fhigh in the canopy. So, unless you get
OL,9,Fa cyclone or a bird bringing one down,
OL,10,Fvery few people get to see them," he
OL,11,Fsaid.
OL,13,FTheir environment might also explain
OL,14,Ftheir large bodies, as they help them
OL,15,Fto survive cool and wet conditions.
OL,17,FTwo specimens of the stick insect have
OL,18,Fnow been included in the Queensland
OL,19,FMuseum for use by other scientists to
OL,20,Fhelp with identifying other animals.
