OL,7,FProfessor Anand Menon, from UK in a
OL,8,FChanging Europe, told ITV News that
OL,9,Fone issue was the number of people
OL,10,Funaware that they can register in
OL,11,Fadvance, arguing that tourists turning
OL,12,Fup without that information will
OL,13,Finevitably slow down the speed at
OL,14,Fwhich the crossings are made.
OL,16,FHe argued there was not much Britain
OL,17,Fcould do given the new system was the
OL,18,Fchoice of the EU and would be coming
OL,19,Finto place later this year.
