OL,8,Fwere experiencing the most significant
OL,9,FGeneral Election result since Margaret
OL,10,FThatcher's victory in 1979.
OL,12,FI haven't changed my view, though 1979
OL,13,Fand 2024 could not be more different
OL,14,Fin the explanations for why they are
OL,15,Fdefining moments.
OL,17,FThatcher's victory mattered for how
OL,18,Fshe changed everything about the
OL,19,Feconomic stewardship of the UK. She
OL,20,Fremade the landscape for generations.

OL,16,FPerhaps the most important is that
