OL,6,FTory leader Kemi Badenoch had said the
OL,7,FConservatives will scrap plans to ban
OL,8,Fthe sale of new petrol and diesel cars
OL,9,Fby 2030, if they win the next general

OL,12,FWriting in the Sunday Telegraph,
OL,13,FBadenoch branded the electric vehicle
OL,14,Fquotas as "economic self-harm".
OL,16,FThe new policy comes as the EU
OL,17,Freportedly plans to back down from its
OL,18,Fown 2035 target to ban the sale of
OL,19,Fpetrol, diesel and hybrid cars.
