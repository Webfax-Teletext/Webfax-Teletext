OL,5,FYou'll gain an hour of sleep when
OL,6,Fclocks go backwards, we lose an hour
OL,7,Fwhen it "springs forward".
OL,9,FSome people like to use the mnemonic

OL,11,Fremember that clocks go forward an
OL,12,Fhour in spring and back in the autumn.
OL,14,FWhat happens if I'm working when the

OL,17,FOf course, everyone is not in bed at

OL,12,FThe decision to change the clocks on a

OL,14,Fmade to minimise disruption to schools

OL,6,Fthe great-great-grandfather of
OL,7,FColdplay lead singer Chris Martin, who
OL,8,Fsuccessfully campaigned in Britain to
OL,9,Fchange the clocks.
OL,11,FIn his pamphlet, The Waste of
OL,12,FDaylight, he proposed clocks should be
OL,13,Fput forward by 80 minutes in four
OL,14,Fsteps during April and reversed the

OL,17,FThanks to his campaigning, British
OL,18,FSummer Time was established in the

OL,20,Fnot live to see the extra daylight he
OL,21,Fhad fought for as he died in 1915.
