OL,6,FIn the first four months of the year
OL,7,F177 pharmacies across England closed,
OL,8,Faccording to The National Pharmacy
OL,9,FAssociation (NPA).
OL,11,FIt means that on average ten
OL,12,Fpharmacies shut every single week.
OL,14,FThe association believes many are
OL,15,Fclosing due to a decline in government
OL,16,Ffunding and high levels of inflation,
OL,17,Fwhich is causing an increase in the
OL,18,Fcost of dispensing medicine.
