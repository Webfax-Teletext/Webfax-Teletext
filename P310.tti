OL,6,FOn Friday, that lawsuit will be heard
OL,7,Fin a US Court, in the Superior Court
OL,8,Fof the State of Delaware. The hearing
OL,9,Fcould see the case thrown out, or else
OL,10,Fgiven the go-ahead to move to the
OL,11,Fdiscovery stage. The latter would
OL,12,Fessentially move the case into an
