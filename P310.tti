OL,6,FExplaining why taxes are rising again
OL,7,Fafter promising they wouldn't was
OL,8,Falways going to be tricky.
OL,10,FThis morning, the prime minister
OL,11,Fsought to defend the narrative the
OL,12,Fgovernment pushed in the run-up to the
OL,13,FBudget.
OL,15,F"I started off #16 billion down," Sir
OL,16,FKeir insisted at a press conference, a
OL,17,Freference to the worst outlook for
OL,18,Fgrowth handed to the government by the
OL,19,FOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

OL,6,F1. The PM is technically correct: the

OL,8,F"could" cut tax revenues by #16

OL,11,F2. But, as the OBR said, higher

OL,14,Fwere forecast to be #16 billion higher

OL,18,Fbillion on welfare and debt interest,
