OL,7,FVeale explained: "When you get this

OL,10,Fand smaller and compressed until you
OL,11,Fget to the very bottom and you can't

OL,14,FSome of these bubbles have been
OL,15,Ftrapped in stasis for over a million
OL,16,Fyears.
OL,18,FThey are so old that these tiny bits

OL,20,Fbeen breathed in by giant mammoths
