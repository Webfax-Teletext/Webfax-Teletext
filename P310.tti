OL,6,FChancellor Rachel Reeves has admitted
OL,7,Fthat there is "more to do" as her
OL,8,Fhistoric Budget speech was accompanied
OL,9,Fby disappointing growth forecasts.
OL,11,F"The growth forecasts today are
OL,12,Fcertainly not the summit of my
OL,13,Fambition," she told ITV News Political
OL,14,FEditor Robert Peston.
OL,16,F"This is the first Budget of this
OL,17,Fparliament, is there more to do?
OL,18,FAbsolutely."

OL,4,CChancellor reflects on Budget
OL,6,FOne of the key areas both she and the
OL,7,Fprime minister pushed ahead of the
OL,8,Fgeneral election was economic growth.
OL,10,FHowever, the Office for Budget
OL,11,FResponsibility's forecast today
OL,12,Fsuggests the increase in spending in
OL,13,Fthe Budget will only provide a

OL,6,F"There's often criticism of

OL,8,Fdecisions reflecting the lifetime of a
OL,9,Fparliament, rather than long-term
OL,10,Fdecisions to put our country on a
OL,11,Fbetter path," Reeves explained.
OL,13,F"What the OBR say is that the long
OL,14,Fterm impact of the decisions we've
OL,15,Fmade today, particularly on
OL,16,Finvestment, will boost GDP by 1.4%.
OL,17,FThat's really welcome."
