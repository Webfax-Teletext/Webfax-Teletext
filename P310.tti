OL,6,FThe Middle East - and countries with
OL,7,Fvested interests in the region - are
OL,8,Fbeing held ransom by two ultra right-
OL,9,Fwing and messianic parties in Israel's
OL,10,Fparliament, the Knesset.
OL,12,FBoth hold just 14 of 120 seats, but
OL,13,Fthose 14 MKs (members of the Knesset)
OL,14,Fgive Benjamin Netanyahu his ruling
OL,15,Fmajority.

OL,19,FBiden, to keep them on board.

OL,6,FBecause of the proportional

OL,8,Fgovernments are always coalitions.
OL,10,FReaching a majority of 61 seats or
OL,11,Fmore often means enlisting the support
