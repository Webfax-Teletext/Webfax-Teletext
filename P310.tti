OL,11,Fparent phrase "no it won't snow today
OL,12,FI'm afraid, it's too cold, it needs to

OL,5,FThe East Antarctic Plateau is
OL,6,Fofficially the coldest place on earth
OL,7,Fwhere air temperatures can reach -90C
OL,8,F- as you can see, there's snow on the
OL,9,Fground.
OL,11,FOymyakon, Russia, is the coldest
OL,12,Fpermanently inhabited place on earth
OL,13,Fwith an average annual temperature of
OL,14,F-16C - snow here too!
OL,16,FThe Andes Mountain in southern Chile
OL,17,Fis the snowiest place on earth and
OL,18,Freceives more than 2,000 inches of
OL,19,Fsnow throughout a 12-month period

OL,8,FSo, at the risk of contradicting mums
OL,9,Feverywhere - I think we can establish
OL,10,Fthat "it's too cold to snow" is not
OL,11,Fstrictly accurate!
OL,13,FHowever, what is certainly true is
OL,14,Fthat the colder the temperature, the
OL,15,Fless likely it is to snow - and that
OL,16,Fis because cold air holds less
OL,17,Fmoisture, and of course, the two
OL,18,Fingredients you need for snow are low
OL,19,Ftemperatures and moisture.

OL,5,FSo when you get those bitterly cold,
OL,6,Fclear winter's days when the lack of
OL,7,Fmoisture in the air makes it feel
OL,8,Fbiting, it's not that it's too cold to
OL,9,Fsnow, it's that it's actually too dry
OL,10,Fto snow.
OL,12,FAnd whilst we're myth-busting, did you

OL,14,Factually need to drop below freezing

OL,3,CIs it ever too cold to snow?
OL,5,FIn fact, in the UK, the heaviest
OL,6,Fsnowfalls tend to occur when the air
OL,7,Ftemperature is between zero and 2C
OL,8,Fbecause the air is cold enough for
OL,9,Fsnow but still mild enough for it to
OL,10,Fhold enough moisture for that other
OL,11,Fvital ingredient.
OL,13,FSo will it be cold and moist enough
OL,14,Ffor widespread snow this week?

OL,5,FThere's not huge amounts of moisture
OL,6,Faround this week apart from a few
OL,7,Fshowers mostly towards eastern areas -
OL,8,Fand whilst we can expect these to
OL,9,Fprobably fall as snow on the high
OL,10,Fground, the air temperature closer to
OL,11,Fsea level will just be too warm.
OL,13,FGranted it feels absolutely freezing

OL,16,Fsweet spot of 0-2C.
