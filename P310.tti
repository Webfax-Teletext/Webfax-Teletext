OL,6,FIt certainly sounded impressive. The
OL,7,Fidea is to weaken Moscow's military-
OL,8,Findustrial complex.JBut in reality
OL,9,Fmany of the sanctions are symbolic.
OL,10,FAfter all, if the US Treasury really
OL,11,Fthought these sanctions would be
OL,12,Feffective in tilting the battlefield
OL,13,Fin Ukraine's favour they would have
OL,14,Fbeen tried two years ago.JSo don't
OL,15,Fexpect the new measures to make much
OL,16,Fdifference despite the rhetoric coming
OL,17,Ffrom the White House.JThe far more
OL,18,Fradical financial step that would
OL,19,Fcertainly change the equation is too
OL,20,Fcontroversial - legally and
OL,21,Fpolitically - to be imposed. At least,
OL,22,Ffor now.

OL,8,Foverseas - currently frozen in
