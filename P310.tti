OL,6,FMethane is the second-largest

OL,8,Fcarbon dioxide, so experimenting with
OL,9,Fways to bring it down is being seen as
OL,10,Fa game-changer.
OL,12,FBut people have made a series of false
OL,13,Fclaims, including accusing Arla of
OL,14,Fbeing "woke" over trying to make the
OL,15,Fdairy industry more environmental.
OL,17,FSo what's Bill Gates got to do with
OL,18,Fit? Nothing. But he has previously
OL,19,Fmade investments in similar methane-
OL,20,Fbusting feeds, but has no direct links
