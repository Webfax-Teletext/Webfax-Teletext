OL,9,Ftechnology start-up Neuralink has
OL,10,Frevealed its first human test subject
OL,11,Fto receive a brain implant.
OL,13,FNoland Arbaugh, 29, was named as the
OL,14,Fvolunteer during a livestream on X,
OL,15,Fformerly known as Twitter.
OL,17,FMr Arbaugh, who is paralysed below the
OL,18,Fshoulder, received the implant in
OL,19,FJanuary and said he was now able to
OL,20,Fplay chess online.

OL,6,F"If y'all can see the cursor moving

OL,8,Fsaid, during the livestream. "It's
OL,9,Fpretty cool, huh?"
OL,11,FNeuralink, which was co-founded by Mr
OL,12,FMusk in 2016, uses brain-computer
OL,13,Finterface (BCI), which analyses brain
OL,14,Fneural signals and translates them
OL,15,Finto commands that can control
OL,16,Fexternal devices.

OL,6,FA social media post by Mr Musk in
OL,7,FJanuary announced the product's name
OL,8,Fas Telepathy, saying initial users
OL,9,Fwould "be those who have lost the use
OL,10,Fof their limbs".
OL,12,F"Imagine if Stephen Hawking could
OL,13,Fcommunicate faster than a speed typist
OL,14,For auctioneer. That is the goal," the
OL,15,Fpost read.
OL,17,FMr Arbaugh, who became a quadriplegic
OL,18,Fafter a driving accident, said that
OL,19,Fthe surgery to get the implant was
OL,20,F"super easy" and that he was "released
OL,21,Ffrom the hospital a day later".

OL,6,FCurrently, Mr Arbaugh seems to have
OL,7,Fexhibited no cognitive impairements
OL,8,Fafter the surgery.
OL,10,FThe procedure involves a surgical
OL,11,Frobot designed to insert the threads
OL,12,Fof the implant into the appropriate
OL,13,Fpart of the brain.
OL,15,FMr Musk had previously said that it
OL,16,Fwould not require anaesthesia and
OL,17,Fwould be an hour long.
OL,19,FNeuralink received a last year to
OL,20,Fbegin initial trails, and began

OL,6,FIn January, Mr Musk tweeted on his

OL,8,Fsubject to receive the impant was
OL,9,F"doing well".
OL,11,FMr Aubaugh, who was also seen playing

OL,13,Fsaid that he had given up trying to
OL,14,Fplay the game.
OL,16,F"You all (Neuralink) gave me the
OL,17,Fability to do that again and (I)
OL,18,Fplayed for eight hours straight," he
OL,19,Fsaid.
