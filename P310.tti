OL,6,FAt the start of the summer many in
OL,7,FWestminster assumed that this new
OL,8,Fparliament, with its young intake and
OL,9,Fbig Labour majority, was on course to
OL,10,Ftake an historic opportunity to pass a
OL,11,Fnew law and enable assisted dying.
OL,13,FNow the outcome is far less certain.
OL,14,FThe majority of MPs say they are
OL,15,Fgenuinely undecided on the issue, or
OL,16,Fare yet to declare their view publicly.
