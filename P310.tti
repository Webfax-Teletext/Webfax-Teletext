OL,6,FMore than two-thirds (68%) of UK
OL,7,Felectric vehicle owners who use public
OL,8,Fchargers say they are unhappy with the
OL,9,Finfrastructure, a survey of consumer
OL,10,Fgroup members suggested.
OL,12,FSome 73% of respondents to the Which?
OL,13,Fpoll said they had experienced a
OL,14,Ffaulty public charger at least once in
OL,15,Fthe previous 12 months, while 37% said
OL,16,Fit was difficult to find a working
OL,17,Fcharger.
OL,19,FDrivers also complained about
OL,20,Fchargepoints being too expensive and
OL,21,Fdifficult to use.
