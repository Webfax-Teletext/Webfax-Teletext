OL,6,Fhighest diesel prices in Europe,
OL,7,Faccording to new analysis.
OL,9,FThe RAC, which carried out the
OL,10,Fresearch, said there is "no good
OL,11,Freason" why British fuel retailers are
OL,12,Fnot cutting pump prices.
OL,14,FIt found the average price of a litre
OL,15,Fof diesel at UK forecourts is 155p.
OL,17,FThat is 5p more than Ireland and
OL,18,FBelgium, which have the continent's
OL,19,Fjoint second most expensive diesel at
OL,20,F150p per litre.

OL,9,FThe vast majority of commercial

OL,13,FRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams
OL,14,Fdescribed having Europe's most

OL,18,FHe said the average retailer margin on

OL,20,Fthe delivered wholesale price and the
OL,21,Fretail price before VAT - is 18p.

OL,5,F"That's a shocking 10p more than the

OL,7,Fof a litre of diesel should really be

OL,12,F"The margin on petrol is also, in our
