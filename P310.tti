OL,6,FEd Davey has said the Liberal
OL,7,FDemocrats are the most united
OL,8,Fpolitical party in Westminster by "a
OL,9,Fcountry mile" as his party's annual
OL,10,Fconference begins.
OL,12,FThe Lib Dem leader insisted his party,
OL,13,Fwhose parliamentary outfit was
OL,14,Fstrengthened nearly fivefold at the
OL,15,Fgeneral election, is "very serious,"
OL,16,Fas he brushed off reports that some of
OL,17,Fhis MPs are concerned about what has
OL,18,Fbeen dubbed his "bull**** stunts".

OL,6,FHe also said that as Labour and the

OL,11,FSpeaking from his parliamentary

OL,14,Fto "make sure our message gets out to

OL,16,Fno other party is saying".
OL,18,F"People, I think, have lost trust in
