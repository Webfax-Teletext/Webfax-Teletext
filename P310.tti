OL,7,FA law which would allow the King to
OL,8,Fformally strip Prince Andrew of his
OL,9,Fdukedom is being introduced in the
OL,10,Fcommons on Wednesday.
OL,12,FYork Central MP Rachael Maskell has

OL,14,Fthe King the power to remove titles.
OL,16,FThe prince announced last week he
OL,17,Fwould stop using his Duke of York
OL,18,Ftitle to avoid distracting from the
OL,19,Fwork of the royal family, but an Act
OL,20,Fof Parliament would be required to
OL,21,Fformally remove the dukedom.
