OL,6,FI wrote last week about Keir Starmer's
OL,7,FPlan for Change, the government's
OL,8,Ftargets for this parliament that will
OL,9,Fbe published on Thursday.
OL,11,FI argued that it represented a return
OL,12,Fto Tony Blair-style cross-departmental
OL,13,Ftarget setting, which were the
OL,14,Fhallmark of Blair's second term in
OL,15,Foffice, under the influence of the
OL,16,Fhead of his "delivery unit", Michael
OL,17,FBarber.

OL,6,FIn Starmer's case, the delivery
OL,7,Fmechanisms will be his "mission
OL,8,Fboards", which are like cabinet
OL,9,Fsubcommittees in bringing together
OL,10,Fassorted cabinet ministers - but are
OL,11,F"more freewheeling", according to a
OL,12,Fmember of the government.
OL,14,FMy impression is that, so far, these
OL,15,Fboards have lacked any urgency to
OL,16,Ftackle the nation-crippling challenges
OL,17,Ffacing underfunded public services and
OL,18,Fa sluggish economy.
