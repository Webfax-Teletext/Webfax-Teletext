OL,3,CAndrew arrest: A crisis at the heart
OL,4,Cof the monarchy
OL,6,FThe message from King Charles today
OL,7,Fwas clear: no one is above the law,
OL,8,Fand that includes my younger brother.
OL,10,FIn issuing his first public words on
OL,11,Fthe matter (previous statements came
OL,12,Ffrom "the Palace"), it was a
OL,13,Frecognition of a crisis at the heart
OL,14,Fof Britain's monarchy.
OL,16,FNo wonder he spoke of his "deepest
OL,17,Fconcern" but added, for clarity, that
OL,18,Fa "full, fair and proper process"
OL,19,Fshould follow.
