OL,6,FBy the middle of next week, a ridge of
OL,7,Fhigh pressure returns, and we expect
OL,8,Fconditions to settle down again. With
OL,9,Fthe chance of more strong late July
OL,10,Fsunshine, it won't take much for
OL,11,Ftemperatures to recover and return to
OL,12,F27-28C in places.
OL,14,FAt this stage, high pressure is
OL,15,Flooking to re-establish itself as we
OL,16,Fgo into August and with drier, settled
OL,17,Fconditions, with more sunshine,
OL,18,Fthere's a higher chance of higher
