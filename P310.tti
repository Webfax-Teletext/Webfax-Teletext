OL,6,FWith the announcement of cuts
OL,7,Famounting to around #47 billion,
OL,8,Fsavings made largely from slashing the
OL,9,Fwelfare system, the shadow chancellor
OL,10,Fwas keen to distance himself from
OL,11,Funfunded promises.
OL,13,F"We will bring taxes down, we must,
OL,14,Fbut we will only do so when it is
OL,15,Faffordable," he said.
OL,17,FSpeaking in the Manchester conference
OL,18,Fhall, Stride critiqued Labour's
OL,19,Feconomic policy and "the vicious cycle
OL,20,Fof more spending, more taxes, more
OL,21,Fborrowing, more debt."
