OL,7,FThe Director of Public Prosecutions
OL,8,F(DPP), Stephen Parkinson, said the
OL,9,Ftrial collapsed because the government
OL,10,Frefused to brand Beijing a threat to

OL,13,FHe also said the Crown Prosecution
OL,14,FService made many attempts to acquire

OL,16,Fwith the trial, but it was not
OL,17,Fprovided by the government.

OL,9,Foutrage over the collapse of a case
OL,10,Fagainst two alleged spies for China as
OL,11,F"nonsense," claiming the trial
OL,12,Fcollapsed due to the previous

OL,15,FHe blamed the collapse of the trial on
OL,16,Fthe "ropey" and "archaic" Official

OL,18,Fminister's view that the Conservative
OL,19,Fgovernment at the time needed to have
OL,20,Fbranded China a threat to secure a
OL,21,Fsuccessful prosecution.
