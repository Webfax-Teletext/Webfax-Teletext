OL,10,FAt the start of a hearing on Thursday,

OL,16,FThe court was told that under

OL,8,Fexceeds the 28 days, or whatever of
OL,9,Fthat was available, so none of that
OL,10,Fproposed use is permitted development.
OL,11,FThat is at the heart of this case."
OL,13,FIn written submissions, the barrister
OL,14,Fsaid in the last few years, Brockwell
OL,15,FPark has "increasingly" been used for
OL,16,Flarge commercial events, with
OL,17,F"substantial" parts of the park being
OL,18,Ffenced off from the public during the
OL,19,Fevents and damage caused to the ground.
