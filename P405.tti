OL,6,FSpeaking to ITV News London, the MP
OL,7,Ffor Finchley & Golders Green said he
OL,8,Fwas called a 'Jewish homosexual pig'
OL,9,Fduring an event where he met voters.
OL,11,FThe threats became so intense Mr Freer
OL,12,Fstarted wearing a stab vest to public
OL,13,Fevents.
OL,15,F"After Ali Harbi Ali () if I was doing
