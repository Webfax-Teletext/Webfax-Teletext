OL,7,FThe head of Britain's biggest police
OL,8,Fforce has hit out at "armchair
OL,9,Fcommentators" who film officers while

OL,12,FMet Police Commissioner Sir Mark
OL,13,FRowley claimed the prospect of
OL,14,Ffrequently being filmed and later
OL,15,Fcritiqued on social media might put

OL,7,FIn the piece, first posted on business
OL,8,Fnetworking site LinkedIn, he said:
OL,9,F"The reality is that policing is
OL,10,Fcomplex, challenging and can look
OL,11,Fmessy.
OL,13,F"We expect officers to arrive on scene
OL,14,Fquickly and act with limited
OL,15,Finformation based on what they see.
OL,17,F"They don't have the benefit of being
OL,18,Fable to watch a full incident unfold
OL,19,Fbefore deciding what to do, they have
OL,20,Fto be decisive and act quickly.
