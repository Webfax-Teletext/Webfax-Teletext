OL,7,FIn an interview with ITV News he said:
OL,8,F"I've had season tickets at Arsenal

OL,13,FBut he explained: "Now I'm prime

OL,15,Fcan't go into the stands. Or if I did
OL,16,Fyou'd have to put so much sort of
OL,17,Fsecurity in that it would cost the
OL,18,Ftaxpayer a fortune."

OL,7,FHe added: "As a result I've been

OL,14,FSir Keir also described his
