OL,6,FLondon doesn't just have one council.
OL,7,FIt has 32 boroughs, plus the City of
OL,8,FLondon Corporation which is over 1,000
OL,9,Fyears old and runs the financial
OL,10,Fdistrict known as the Square Mile. On
OL,11,Ftop of that, there is a London-wide
OL,12,Fmayor.
OL,14,FLondon's 32 borough councils - from
OL,15,FBarnet in the north to Bromley in the
OL,16,Fsouth-east - are responsible for the
OL,17,Fservices you deal with most: rubbish
OL,18,Fcollection, local roads, libraries,
OL,19,Fsocial care, housing and most planning
OL,20,Fdecisions.

OL,3,CWho controls my local council in
OL,4,CLondon?
OL,6,FCouncillors are elected every four
OL,7,Fyears. The party (or independent
OL,8,Fgroup) with the most councillors
OL,9,Fusually takes control and appoints a
OL,10,Fcouncil leader.
OL,12,FThen there's the City of London - the
OL,13,Fhistoric Square Mile - which is
OL,14,Fgoverned separately by the City of
OL,15,FLondon Corporation which traces its
OL,16,Froots back to medieval times. It works
OL,17,Flike a council, but businesses as well
OL,18,Fas residents get votes in local
OL,19,Felections.

OL,3,CWho controls my local council in

OL,6,FAbove all of this sits the Greater
OL,7,FLondon Authority, led by the Mayor of
OL,8,FLondon. The Mayor handles city-wide
OL,9,Fissues such as transport (through
OL,10,FTransport for London), policing
OL,11,Foversight, fire services, and London-
OL,12,Fwide planning strategy.
OL,14,FPut simply: boroughs run your
