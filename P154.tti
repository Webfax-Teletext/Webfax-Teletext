OL,8,Gstrange scheduling on ITV 1 lately.
OL,10,FDifferent weeks have brought feasts or

OL,13,FRecently, there has been up to 90
OL,14,Fminutes of regional output at peak

OL,17,FBut anyone who imagines a resurgence

OL,9,FSince the ITV Evening News was

OL,12,Fthe nations: 8.30pm on Thursday and

OL,15,FThis week neither of these slots are

OL,6,FNobody should blame ITV for this. It

OL,10,FBut when the regional slots start to

OL,12,Fquestions over whether the current
OL,13,Farrangements could be improved.
OL,15,FTopical programmes like UTV Life need

OL,15,FIf ITV can drop Coronation Street or
