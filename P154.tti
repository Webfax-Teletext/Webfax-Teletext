OL,6,GSome may have been surprised to read
OL,7,Gmy argument that ITV should drop the
OL,8,Guse of legacy brands in the English
OL,9,Gregions.
OL,11,FIt may seem like an odd argument to
OL,12,Fmake for someone who cares about the
OL,13,Frich heritage of broadcasting.
OL,15,FOf course, arguments are just that `
OL,16,Farguments. Other people can take the
OL,17,Fopposite view and nobody is right or
OL,18,Fwrong.

OL,6,FMy belief that a rebranding should be
OL,7,Fconsidered is rooted in a passionate
OL,8,Fconcern for regional news provision
OL,9,Fitself.
OL,11,FIt is one of ITV's key legal
OL,12,Fobligations. High quality regional
OL,13,Fnews on C3 provides competition for
OL,14,Fthe BBC, choice for the public and
OL,15,Fplurality in a democracy.
OL,17,FWith TV ratings declining, it is
OL,18,Fimportant to make sure high quality,
OL,19,Freputable journalism is available
OL,20,Fonline too.

OL,6,FHistorically English TV regions
OL,7,Freflected transmitter coverage areas `
OL,8,Fnot existing political or cultural
OL,9,Fentities. Where the two combined it
OL,10,Fwas fortuitous.
OL,12,FHowever when ITV was a commercial
OL,13,Fmonopoly, TV regions helped to forge
OL,14,Fan additional identity. Which TV

OL,6,FAs far as I know, only TV Times, the

OL,6,FAn old brand name is not a bad thing
OL,7,Fwhen it is still relevant. Many of the
OL,8,FBBC's English regional news titles
OL,9,Fdate from the 1960s. But with the
OL,10,Fexception of Spotlight they all
OL,11,Fexplicitly refer to the broad region
OL,12,Fthey serve, not a bygone corporate
OL,13,Fname.
OL,15,FCrucially the BBC does not apply those
OL,16,Fprogramme brands to its website.
OL,18,FITV could be accused of treating its
OL,19,Fregional names with a certain benign
OL,20,Fneglect ` it isn't building the
OL,21,Fregional brands but it is not killing
OL,22,Fthem either.
