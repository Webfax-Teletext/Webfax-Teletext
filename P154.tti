OL,6,GQuietly and with no ceremony, there
OL,7,Ghas been a significant change to the
OL,8,Gformat of the STV News at 6.
OL,10,FAn innovative format which saw the
OL,11,Fprogramme co-presented from both
OL,12,FGlasgow and Edinburgh has been dropped.
OL,14,FThere is now just one presenter based
OL,15,Fin Glasgow.
OL,17,FThe sub-opt bulletin for the Edinburgh
OL,18,Farea remains but is presented from
OL,19,FGlasgow.
OL,21,FNothing is said on-air to draw

OL,6,FHaving said all that, the story of

OL,9,Fthey are really effective.
OL,11,FSTV only started to split advertising

OL,15,FA news sub-opt followed around 2006.

OL,6,FThe editorial justification is obvious
OL,7,Fbut the split between the east and
OL,8,Fwest of Scotland is not as
OL,9,Fstraightforward as many other sub-opts.
OL,11,FThe Edinburgh service is carried from

OL,15,FHowever some viewers in Edinburgh have
OL,16,Ftheir aerials directed towards

OL,20,FEdinburgh takes the Blackhill signal.

OL,10,FWhile the Edinburgh opt is definitely
OL,11,Fa boost to viewers there, the scale of
OL,12,Fthe area covered by the Glasgow

OL,6,FAt one level, it is a regional news
OL,7,Fprogramme for Central Scotland. At
OL,8,Fanother, it competes with the BBC to
OL,9,Fprovide Scottish national news.
OL,11,FThe STV News sometimes includes

OL,15,FSimilarly it is not always possible to
OL,16,Fneatly define a Glasgow or Edinburgh

OL,19,FHopefully though the new format will
