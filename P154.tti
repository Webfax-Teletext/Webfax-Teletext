OL,6,GUKTV, already no stranger to quirky
OL,7,Gchannel names, has announced it's
OL,8,Gtaking a major step next year in
OL,9,Gbringing all of its services under a

OL,12,FThe broadcaster that brought us Alibi,
OL,13,FDave and W has confirmed that from
OL,14,Fsummer 2024, its free-to-air and
OL,15,Fstreaming services will transition to
OL,16,Fa new brand, simply called 'U'. Its
OL,17,Fpay channels will follow later.

OL,8,Fwill become U&Dave.
OL,9,F Drama turns into U&DRAMA.
OL,10,F Yesterday becomes U&YESTERDAY.
OL,11,F And W will be known as U&W.
OL,12,F Streaming service UKTV Play will
OL,13,Fsimply be known as U.
