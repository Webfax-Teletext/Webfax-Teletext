OL,7,FA man from Carlisle says more needs to

OL,15,FThe reformed shoplifter from Barrow

OL,5,Ccrime
OL,7,FWith his criminal past now behind him,
OL,8,FDanny is sharing his story as he
OL,9,Fbegins a new chapter in Carlisle,
OL,10,Fhoping to inspire others to follow in
OL,11,Fhis footsteps.
OL,13,FThe 41-year-old explained that his
OL,14,Foffending began during his teenage
OL,15,Fyears with "petty theft", slowly
OL,16,Fescalating to stealing cars and other
OL,17,Fmore serious crimes.
OL,19,FHe says much of his motivation was the
OL,20,Fdesperate need for money to fund his
OL,21,Fdependency.

OL,13,FDanny initially relied on friends and
