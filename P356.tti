OL,7,Freview of the rules covering          
OL,8,Fadvertising on ITV, Channel 4 and     
OL,9,FChannel 5.                            
OL,11,FIt is seeking views on whether        
OL,12,Fadditional rules still need to apply to
OL,13,Fthese three channels.                 
OL,15,FThere are three particular rules which
OL,16,Fmay change:                           
OL,18,FCrucially there is no suggestion of   
OL,19,Frelaxing the rule which means there can
OL,20,Fbe no more than 12 minutes of adverts

OL,6,FThe clarification from Ofcom about the
OL,7,Fdetails of their review is helpful and
OL,8,Fmakes it easier to look at how the

OL,12,FIn a couple of earlier articles, I    
OL,13,Fnoted how ITV already runs 12 minutes

OL,16,Fespecially between 4pm and 6pm and    
OL,17,Fbetween 7pm and the start of News at

OL,6,FOn a typical day, there is at least 10
OL,7,Fminutes 30 seconds of advertising in  
OL,8,Fevery clock hour except those beginning
OL,9,Fat 6am, 2pm, 3pm, 6pm, 10pm and 11pm. 
OL,10,FThere is, of course, little or no     
OL,11,Fadvertising after midnight.           
OL,13,FThe only dramatic changes would be in 
OL,14,Fthe two "news hours" although a few   
OL,15,Fprogramme durations may have to be    
OL,16,Freduced slightly to make the schedule

OL,6,FBut one crucial question is whether too
OL,7,Fmuch advertising could simply be      
OL,8,Fcounterproductive and scare viewers   
OL,9,Foff.                                  
OL,11,FWhen hour long dramas started to have 
OL,12,Fthree internal breaks rather than two 
OL,13,Faround 20 years ago, there was some   
OL,14,Finitial backlash.                     
OL,16,FLooking at the potential changes, there
OL,17,Fcould be a trade off between longer

OL,6,FITV could, in theory, schedule two    
OL,7,Fbreaks during Emmerdale if the rules  
OL,8,Fwere relaxed. But they would be very  
OL,9,Fbrave to do this  especially when, in
OL,10,Fpractice, that would not allow them to
OL,11,Fshow any more advertising during that 
OL,12,Fhour.                                 
OL,14,FOn the other hand, could the option of
OL,15,Frunning internal breaks of a longer   
OL,16,Fduration prove handy? This can already
OL,17,Fhappen during films to reduce the     
OL,18,Fnumber of breaks.

OL,6,FAt present, there are three breaks of 
OL,7,F3.30 during the first hour of This

OL,9,Fextend these breaks to 4 minutes'

OL,6,FIt is also seeking views on whether the
OL,7,Frule which prevents ITV, Channel 4 and
OL,8,FChannel 5 running teleshopping before 
OL,9,Fmidnight should go. To my mind, this  
OL,10,Fwould undoubtedly be a damaging

OL,13,FUltimately though it is becoming      
OL,14,Fincreasingly hard to justify actual   
OL,15,Frestrictions on the three channels    
OL,16,Fwhich do not apply to others. The
