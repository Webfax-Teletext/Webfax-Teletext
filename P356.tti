OL,8,Fbyelaw restricting the right to roam
OL,9,Fon the proposed site of Scotland's

OL,12,FThe byelaw would restrict public
OL,13,Faccess rights over land at Huntlaw and
OL,14,FMuirfield Farm, near Hawick, but it
OL,15,Fwill need ministerial approval from
OL,16,Fthe Scottish Government to go ahead.
OL,18,FCouncillors had already agreed
