OL,6,Gthere was unexpected news from the
OL,7,Gbroadcaster.
OL,9,FIts on demand service and spinoff
OL,10,Fchannels are to be rebranded with the
OL,11,FChannel 4 name.
OL,13,FThe on-demand service will simply be
OL,14,Fknown as Channel 4 but the exact
OL,15,Fbranding of the spinoff channels has
OL,16,Fnot been revealed.

OL,11,FBut the idea of using the Channel 4

OL,9,Fas audiences increasingly no longer

OL,13,F'Channel 4' brand.
OL,15,FThe brand transformation follows

OL,5,FUp until now, the "4" alone has been
OL,6,Fthe linking theme  effectively the

OL,8,FThe problem is there are other channels

OL,11,FThe renaming brings the family of

OL,5,FPerhaps you might like to see the

OL,7,Fcollectively as an eclectic range of
OL,8,Foutlets for different programmes 
OL,9,Frather like the main channel in

OL,12,FIt looks as if Channel 4 has escaped
OL,13,Fthe threat of privatisation by the skin
OL,14,Fof its teeth.
OL,16,FThe apparent public apathy towards the

OL,5,FIt would seem the public no longer
OL,6,Fregard Channel 4 as special although
OL,7,Fthe economic arguments against
OL,8,Fprivatisation seemed very convincing 
OL,9,Ffew but the Treasury looked likely to
OL,10,Fpositively benefit.
OL,12,FHowever it would seem inevitable that
OL,13,Fprivatisation will come up again at
OL,14,Fsome point.
OL,16,FIf Channel 4 commissions more
OL,17,Fprogrammes which are obviously unlike
OL,18,Fthose on other commercial channels,
OL,19,Fthen hopefully it will be easier for
