OL,7,Fafternoon on 5th December 2015 when I
OL,8,Fdrove down to Penrith with my 3 year
OL,9,Fold daughter. Having enjoyed a great
OL,10,FChristmas day out at Rheged the year
OL,11,Fbefore, I was keen to take her back
OL,12,Fthere to post her letter to Santa.
OL,14,FIn hindsight, we should have stayed
OL,15,Fhome but at lunchtime, the weather
OL,16,Fwasn't worryingly bad.
OL,18,FHow wrong I was.

OL,6,FOn the way home we turned the car

OL,8,Fthe Environment Agency. Flood alerts
OL,9,Fhad gone out and homes on Warwick Road
OL,10,Fwere being evacuated.
OL,12,FSuddenly I began to panic and called
OL,13,Fmy husband who was at work.
OL,15,FI had not long moved back to ITV
OL,16,FBorder from ITV Yorkshire, and had
OL,17,Freported on the Carlisle floods of
OL,18,F2005 which at the time, had been
OL,19,Fdescribed as a 'once in a 200 year'
OL,20,Fevent.

OL,4,Cto dry land': when my home flooded
OL,6,FWe were renting a house in the pretty
OL,7,Fvillage of Warwick Bridge very close
OL,8,Fto the River Eden.
OL,10,FAs we arrived home in the dark, the
OL,11,Frain by this time was torrential. The
OL,12,Friver had burst its banks and the
OL,13,Fwater was quickly heading in our
OL,14,Fdirection.
OL,16,FI spotted my husband and neighbours
OL,17,Ffrantically gathering sandbags. If
OL,18,Fyou've never lifted one, they are much
OL,19,Fheavier than you think.

OL,6,FThe next morning mountain rescue teams
OL,7,Ffrom Worcestershire came to our aid.
OL,8,FThey'd travelled up to Cumbria to
OL,9,Fsupport the county's emergency
OL,10,Fservices and we were so grateful to
OL,11,Fthem. They carried me and my daughter
OL,12,Fand we made our way to dry land via
OL,13,Fboat holding onto precious belongings.
OL,15,FWe were fortunate that this wasn't our
OL,16,Fown home and we had family to move in
OL,17,Fwith. While we could walk away from
OL,18,Fthe property, for so many others the
OL,19,Fnightmare had only just started.
