OL,8,Fsaid: "I went to school near Moniaive
OL,9,Fand then onto university.
OL,11,F"I was working for 10 years or so
OL,12,Facross the UK looking at geography and
OL,13,Ftrue environmental science. I ended up
OL,14,Flooking at people and how people

OL,11,FMcNabb explained the work that went on
OL,12,Fduring the project, saying: "The
OL,13,FGalloway Glens scheme is five years of
OL,14,Fco-ordinated activity. Rather than
OL,15,Fdoing a single big project you do a
OL,16,Fseries of projects in a defined area
OL,17,Fand these projects feed off of each

OL,6,F"By approaching them in a more co-

OL,12,Fout a little corner.
OL,14,F"The Galloway Glens name was chosen
OL,15,Fbecause it doesn't exist. The Galloway
