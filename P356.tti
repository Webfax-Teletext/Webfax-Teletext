OL,7,FSpeaking to ITV Border, Simpson said:
OL,8,F"I think for long periods against
OL,9,FGillingham the performance was good
OL,10,Fbut we didn't make it count and I
OL,11,Fthought against Stoke City on Tuesday
OL,12,Fit was good as well.
OL,14,F"We had opportunities in the first
OL,15,Fhalf where we could have worked the
OL,16,Fgoalkeeper. We had an opportunity from
OL,17,Fa set play right at the beginning of
OL,18,Fthe second half. Then you get punished
OL,19,Ffor it, especially when you are
OL,20,Fplaying against that level of
OL,21,Fopposition.

OL,7,F"I thought on paper we had two tough

OL,11,F"We faced a Gillingham side who hadn't
