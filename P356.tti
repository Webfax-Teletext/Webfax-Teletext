OL,7,FStuart Hall, from Stainburn near ,
OL,8,Fspent his 18th birthday in 1984 in a
OL,9,Fhospital ward fighting cancer. During
OL,10,Fhis treatment, he was given multiple
OL,11,Fblood transfusions.
OL,13,FIn 1995, he was informed that one of
OL,14,Fthe samples he had received had been
OL,15,Fcontaminated hepatitis C, a virus that
OL,16,Fcan seriously damage the liver. This
OL,17,Fled to diagnoses of diabetes and,
OL,18,Feventually, liver cancer.
