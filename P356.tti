OL,12,FNo. Normally the World Cup takes place
OL,13,Fat the height of summer amidst repeats
OL,14,Fand fillers. Instead it's at the peak
OL,15,Fof the autumn TV season.

OL,7,FThe only regular winter sporting events
OL,8,Fwhich dominate and disrupt the
OL,9,Fschedules are the Winter Olympics and,
OL,10,Fsometimes, the Commonwealth Games.
OL,12,FBut these events are only shown by the
OL,13,FBBC. Scheduling World Cup games poses
OL,14,Fdilemmas for both the BBC and ITV.
OL,16,FThe unusual nature of this World Cup
OL,17,Fmeans there are occasions when matches
OL,18,Fare being shown simultaneously on both

OL,7,FThe adaptations to the two main

OL,7,FIt is not ideal but when English

OL,12,FITV 1 however seems to consider the

OL,14,Fdispensable.

OL,7,FEven on nights without football, the
