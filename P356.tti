OL,6,FWe have argued before that proposed BBC
OL,7,Fcuts can sometimes seem like          
OL,8,Fnegotiating positions.                
OL,10,FIn the past, plans to axe services such
OL,11,Fas 6 Music and the Red Button text    
OL,12,Fservice were dropped or substantially 
OL,13,Fmodified.                             
OL,15,FSo is the proposal to merge the BBC   
OL,16,FNews Channel and BBC World News also a
OL,17,Fnegotiating position? Or is it the    
OL,18,FBBC's final word?

OL,6,FNaturally there will be a worry over  
OL,7,Fjobs. Staff are having to reapply for a
OL,8,Freduced number of positions. Naturally
OL,9,Fthere is a fear over redundancies.    
OL,11,FIt should be stressed that any        
OL,12,Fcompulsory redundancies would almost  
OL,13,Fcertainly lead to industrial action.  
OL,14,FThe NUJ is in a very strong position at

OL,6,FPerhaps the bigger concern to the wider

OL,9,Ftoo little has been said.
