OL,6,F"And we also know that 80% of marine
OL,7,Flitter comes from land and it's making
OL,8,Fits way down stream down rivers to the
OL,9,Fsea.J"Of course when it gets into the
OL,10,Fsea it's affecting the marine
OL,11,Fenvironment, it's killing wildlife,
OL,12,Fand threatening habitats and
OL,13,Fecosystems.J"So our Upstream Battle
OL,14,Fcampaign is to tackle marine litter at
OL,15,Fsource along rivers in Scotland.J"It
OL,16,Fstarted on the river Clyde in 2018 but
OL,17,Fwe've been spreading it across
OL,18,FScotland so we're down in Lockerbie
OL,19,Fbecause we want to get an idea of what
OL,20,Fthe litter problem is across all of
OL,21,Four rivers.J"So the surveys that we
OL,22,Fgather across Scotland will contribute
OL,23,Fto a national dataset which will
OL,24,Fhopefully give a better picture of
OL,25,Fwhat's going on and where the problems
OL,26,Fare, where the hotspots are."
