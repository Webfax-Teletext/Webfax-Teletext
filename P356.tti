OL,5,GIt is 30 years this month since Channel
OL,6,G4's first attempt to break the mould of
OL,7,Gbreakfast television came to an end.
OL,9,FThe Channel 4 Daily included a high
OL,10,Fquality world news service, arts
OL,11,Fcoverage, business bulletins and even a
OL,12,Fmini version of Countdown.
OL,14,FLaunched in a wave of publicity its
OL,15,Finitial ratings were dismal but, as was
OL,16,Ftypical of Channel 4 at the time, the
OL,17,Fchannel persevered. The programme won a
OL,18,Floyal audience albeit one much smaller
OL,19,Fthan the BBC's and TV-am's.

OL,6,Ffirst edition (3rd April 1989).
OL,8,FIt came to an end months before Channel
OL,9,F4 started to sell its own advertising
OL,10,Fand lost its direct subsidy from ITV.
OL,11,FThe timing was not coincidental.
OL,13,FChannel 4 was not prepared to subsidise
OL,14,Fthis particular venture with the ad
OL,15,Fmoney from Brookside or Countdown. It
OL,16,Fhad much more important things to

OL,5,FIn its place came The Big Breakfast  a
OL,6,Fshow aimed at a different audience
OL,7,Fwhich soon became very popular and
OL,8,Fcommercially successful but was also in
OL,9,Fkeeping with the quirky side of Channel
OL,10,F4's personality.
OL,12,FWhen Channel 4 announced it was to move
OL,13,Finto breakfast television, the channel
OL,14,Fwas clear that it would not take
OL,15,Fresources away from the rest of the
OL,16,Fschedule.
OL,18,FJust as the regional ITV companies sold
OL,19,FChannel 4's advertising time in their
OL,20,Fareas, so TV-am sold the time between
OL,21,F6am and 9.25am.

OL,5,FTV-am then paid a "fourth channel
OL,6,Fsubscription" agreed by the IBA  this
OL,7,Feffectively meant TV-am was subsidising
OL,8,FThe Channel 4 Daily. In turn, The
OL,9,FChannel 4 Daily was not aimed at
OL,10,FTV-am's target audience and did not
OL,11,Fcompete against it.
OL,13,FHowever, as far as we are aware, TV-am
OL,14,Fwas not responsible for playing out the
OL,15,Fadverts and the Channel 4 signal was
OL,16,Fnot rerouted through TV-am.
OL,18,FAt all times the Channel 4 signal
OL,19,Fcontinued to pass through the regional

OL,21,Ftransmitters.

OL,5,FIt is thought  but not confirmed 
OL,6,Fthat ITN played in the ads. ITN was
OL,7,Falso responsible for the coordination

OL,10,Fpassed through Channel 4 Presentation

OL,13,FIt is perhaps sad to think of the
OL,14,Ffailure of The Channel 4 Daily. Did the
OL,15,Fmarket not exist? Or was it simply
OL,16,Fovershadowed by the two big programmes

OL,18,Fwas it sufficiently different to BBC
