OL,6,FKirsty Gomersal, the senior coroner
OL,7,Ffor Cumbria, has now written a Report
OL,8,Fto Prevent Future Deaths addressed to
OL,9,Fthe Electricity Networks Association
OL,10,F(ENA), calling for action to avoid a
OL,11,Frepeat of the incident.
OL,13,FThe coroner concluded in Mr Oates'
OL,14,Finquest that a "rare and complex
OL,15,Fsequence of events" led to his death,
OL,16,Fand said that, in her opinion, there
OL,17,Fis a low "risk that future deaths will
OL,18,Foccur unless action is taken".

OL,6,FThe inquest into Mr Oates' death heard
OL,7,Fthat a 11kv conductor wire was hanging
OL,8,Flow and continued to be live as it did
OL,9,Fnot touch earth.
OL,11,FThe coroner was told this was a result
OL,12,Fof the failure of two porcelain
OL,13,Ftension disc insulators, due to voids
OL,14,Fin their concrete filling, which an
OL,15,Finvestigation found was "introduced in
