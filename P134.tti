OL,6,G1970 Robert Dougall presents the first
OL,7,Gedition of the Nine o'Clock News (BBC
OL,8,GOne). Each news presenter (Dougall,
OL,9,GBaker and Kendall) anchored the
OL,10,Gprogramme for one week at a time.
OL,11,GDougall commented that the desk was
OL,12,Gfar too small and he disliked the
OL,13,G"porthole" set. He was referring to
OL,14,Gthe large clock face, which was a
OL,15,Gprominent feature of the grey set. The
OL,16,Gset was described in one newspaper as
OL,17,Ga "sort of polystyrene padded cell".
OL,18,GDougall was instructed to wear a logo
OL,19,Gnecktie, a suggestion that offended
OL,20,Ghis gentlemanly taste - so he refused.
