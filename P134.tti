OL,6,G1970 Robert Dougall presents the
OL,7,Gfirst edition of the Nine o'Clock
OL,8,GNews (BBC One). Each news presenter
OL,9,G(Dougall, Baker and Kendall) anchored
OL,10,Gthe programme for one week at a time.
OL,11,GDougall commented that the desk was
OL,12,Gfar too small and he disliked the
OL,13,G"porthole" set. He was referring to
OL,14,Gthe large clock face, which was a
OL,15,Gprominent feature of the grey set.
OL,16,GThe set was described in one
OL,17,Gnewspaper as a "sort of polystyrene
OL,18,Gpadded cell".JDougall was instructed
OL,19,Gto wear a logo necktie, a suggestion
OL,20,Gthat offended his gentlemanly taste -
OL,21,Gso he refused.
