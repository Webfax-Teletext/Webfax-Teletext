OL,6,FThe BBC's Wimbledon coverage saw the  
OL,7,Fintroduction of a new BBC Sport       
OL,8,Fgraphics package. I began to recreate 
OL,9,Fthe on-screen graphics, firstly as    
OL,10,Fstills, but with the aim of eventually
OL,11,Frecreating the animations.            
OL,13,FAs a 'what if' I applied the graphics 
OL,14,Fto the BBC's coverage of the Winter   
OL,15,FOlympic Games.                        
OL,17,FWhen the BBC updated the graphics used
OL,18,Ffor Final Score, they kept the previous
OL,19,Flayout and simply updated the design  
OL,20,Fand animations to match the new BBC   
OL,21,FSport branding.

OL,6,FI felt a few elements didn't completely
OL,7,Fmatch, such as the grey ticker  a new
OL,8,Fstyle version has been used on Match of
OL,9,Fthe Day.                              
OL,11,FThe large box displaying the BBC Sport
OL,12,Fand Final Score logos was also        
OL,13,Fsomething I didn't think was needed, so
OL,14,FI extended the vidiprinter to fit the

OL,6,FMy animated recreation of the name    
OL,7,Fstrap is largely the same as the      
OL,8,Fversion we've seen used for Wimbledon 
OL,9,Fand the Commonwealth Games. This      
OL,10,Fversion has the yellow (and multicolour
OL,11,Fgradient) portion of the strap fade   
OL,12,Finto place. I prefer this to other    
OL,13,Fversions which use a vertical stretch 
OL,14,Finstead.                              
OL,16,FThe only element of the original      
OL,17,Fgraphic I changed is the animation of 
OL,18,Fthe BBC Sport logo. The fade version  
OL,19,Fmoved a bit too quickly, so I swapped 
OL,20,Fit for the slower version used on the 
OL,21,Fstretch animation.
