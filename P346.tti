OL,6,
OL,7,GThere was an awkward moment at the
OL,8,Gstart of the weather segment on the BBC
OL,9,GNews at One today, when a studio guest
OL,10,Ggot in the way of the camera shot.
OL,12,
OL,13,FEconomics correspondent Andy Verity was
OL,14,Fseated at the Studio E desk for a brief
OL,15,Fdiscussion with presenter Jane Hill on
OL,16,Fthe programme's final story.
OL,18,
OL,19,FDiscussion complete and it was time to
OL,20,Fpop across to the catwalk for the
OL,21,Fweather, with Tomasz Schafernaker.

OL,6,
OL,7,FAs usual, when we transition to the
OL,8,Fweather segment, we get a wide shot of
OL,9,Fthe studio. But something's not quite
OL,10,Fright.
OL,12,
OL,13,FThe floor manager is seen waving
OL,14,Ffrantically to catch Andy Verity's
OL,15,Fattention. Presumably she's been
OL,16,Finformed by the director that Andy is
OL,17,Fobstructing the camera shot of the
OL,18,Fweather presenter.

OL,8,Fthe back of Andy's head is in shot.
