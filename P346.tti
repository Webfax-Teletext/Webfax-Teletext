OL,5,GThere was an awkward moment at the
OL,6,Gstart of the weather segment on the BBC
OL,7,GNews at One today, when a studio guest
OL,8,Ggot in the way of the camera shot.
OL,10,FEconomics correspondent Andy Verity was
OL,11,Fseated at the Studio E desk for a brief
OL,12,Fdiscussion with presenter Jane Hill on
OL,13,Fthe programme's final story.
OL,15,FDiscussion complete and it was time to
OL,16,Fpop across to the catwalk for the
OL,17,Fweather, with Tomasz Schafernaker.

OL,5,FAs usual, when we transition to the
OL,6,Fweather segment, we get a wide shot of
OL,7,Fthe studio. But something's not quite
OL,8,Fright.
OL,10,FThe floor manager is seen waving
OL,11,Ffrantically to catch Andy Verity's
OL,12,Fattention. Presumably she's been
OL,13,Finformed by the director that Andy is
OL,14,Fobstructing the camera shot of the
OL,15,Fweather presenter.
OL,17,FWhen we then cut to the weather camera,
OL,18,Fthe back of Andy's head is in shot.
OL,19,FAfter a few seconds, he moves out of
OL,20,Fthe way.
