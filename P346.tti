OL,6,GThey say Christmas comes earlier every
OL,7,Gyear. But when it comes to the BBC News
OL,8,Gon BBC One, there's never been
OL,9,Gconsistency to holiday scheduling.
OL,11,FThis year, the BBC started to move
OL,12,Ftowards a holiday schedule unusually
OL,13,Fearly.
OL,15,FOn 21st December, the BBC News at Six
OL,16,Fand the regional programmes were
OL,17,Fcurtailed because of Sports Personality
OL,18,Fof the Year ` pushed from its normal
OL,19,FSunday night slot by the World Cup.

OL,6,FThe following night, more surprisingly,
OL,7,FA Question of Sport took the 6.30pm
OL,8,Fslot. On both days, the One and Ten ran
OL,9,Fto their usual lengths.
OL,11,FThe exact reasoning seems unclear. On
OL,12,Fboth occasions, the full news hour
OL,13,Fwould have been likely to get more

OL,6,FBut a look back at the schedules
OL,7,Freveals that the BBC has form in this
OL,8,Ffrom decades ago.
OL,10,FOn Friday 20th December 1974 there was
OL,11,Fno Nine o'Clock News. A shortened
OL,12,Fbulletin was shown at 9.15pm. The
OL,13,Freason? It seems a repeat of The
OL,14,FGoodies and Ken Dodd's World of
OL,15,FLaughter was more in keeping with the
OL,16,Fholiday mood.
OL,18,FFast forward to 1978. Of course, BBC TV
OL,19,Fwas blacked out for several days before
OL,20,FChristmas that year but the planned
OL,21,Fschedule for 22nd December was unusual.

OL,6,FThere was to be no regional news and

OL,8,Fbe allowed to opt out of The Clangers
OL,9,Fat 5.35pm for a brief bulletin. At 6pm
OL,10,FEBC 1 with Rod Hull and Emu was due to

OL,13,FThe periods between Christmas and New
OL,14,FYear have also witnessed changing
OL,15,Fattitudes towards news over the years.
OL,17,FIn the late-80s, there were occasions
OL,18,Fwhen all the main national and regional
OL,19,Fbulletins were shown as usual on any
