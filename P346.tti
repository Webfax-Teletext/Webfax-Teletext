OL,5,GThe BBC's reputation rests on its
OL,6,Gjournalism. The breakdowns during Laura
OL,7,GKuenssberg's interview with the Prime
OL,8,GMinister this morning will be taken
OL,9,Gseriously.
OL,11,FWhat went wrong? Could anything have
OL,12,Fbeen done differently? Or was it,
OL,13,Fsadly, just one of those things which
OL,14,Fhappen in live television?
OL,16,FThe fact the programme DOG remained

OL,5,FFrom here, it would have made its way
OL,6,Fto what we still like to think of as
OL,7,FNetwork Control aka Playout.

OL,5,FThe basic procedures were clear to
OL,6,Fevery network director and announcer.
OL,7,FThe announcer calmly apologised, played
OL,8,Fmusic if the problem persisted and 
OL,9,Fwhen appropriate  kept viewers across
OL,10,Fthe situation. It was taken seriously.
OL,12,FDuring a high-profile breakdown, one
OL,13,Fexperienced announcer couldn't get the
OL,14,Fstandby music to start and made a joke
OL,15,Fabout it. It may have seemed human but
OL,16,Fsuch was Presentation's concern for the
OL,17,FBBC's reputation that he got told off.

OL,5,FProblems can arise during any live

OL,13,FNo doubt behind the scenes, efforts

OL,7,Fprogrammes would seem to be in need of
OL,8,Freview  even if, thankfully, serious
OL,9,Fbreakdowns are now rare.
OL,11,FIt's true that the output of the
