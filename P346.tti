OL,6,GThe effective merger of the old BBC

OL,11,FBig news in the UK may not be of much

OL,14,FBut perhaps the strangest example we

OL,6,FIt is easy to justify this decision
OL,7,Fto UK viewers ` especially as news
OL,8,Fchannels often lead on what is new
OL,9,Frather than necessarily most
OL,10,Fimportant.
OL,12,FViewers in the UK will be familiar

OL,6,FHowever the details of some tabloid

OL,10,FUnless news organisations have actual
OL,11,Fproof that these stories are true,
OL,12,Fthey could be successfully sued.
OL,14,FNaturally the BBC had to be very
