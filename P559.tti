OL,6,FA subtle change seems to have been made
OL,7,Fto UTV's promotions for local
OL,8,Fprogrammes.
OL,10,FThey now seem to be routinely referring
OL,11,Fto ITV X orally.
OL,13,FFor example, they might end with words
OL,14,Fsuch as: "Dogs with Jobs, coming soon
OL,15,Fon UTV and ITV X."
OL,17,FThis is in line with the practice on
