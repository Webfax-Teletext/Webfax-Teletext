OL,6,FPeople living with disabilities in
OL,7,FGuernsey have spoken out over 'near
OL,8,Fmisses' which they say are caused by
OL,9,Fnarrow pavements on the island.
OL,11,FThey want pedestrian routes to be made
OL,12,Fmore accessible as they face several
OL,13,Fsafety issues including cars on
OL,14,Fpavements, cobbles and high curbs
OL,15,Fwhich make it hard to get around
OL,16,Feasily.
OL,18,FSimon De La Mare is visually impaired
OL,19,Fand relies on his guide dog Cyril to
OL,20,Fnavigate the streets.

OL,6,FHe says: "The main issue for me is if
OL,7,Fthere are cars parked, road signs or
OL,8,Funexpected roadworks."
OL,10,FMr De La Mare adds: "Everyday you'll
OL,11,Fget the traffic news on the radio and
OL,12,Fit will obviously explain all the
OL,13,Froads that are closed but it wouldn't
OL,14,Fusually say if certain pavements were
OL,15,Fclosed and that's an issue for me."
OL,17,FHe says he hopes to raise more
OL,18,Fawareness about pavements and
OL,19,Fpotential trip hazards for people with
OL,20,Faccessibility needs.
