OL,6,FA family in Guernsey has said they are
OL,7,F"drowning" over a lack of support for
OL,8,Ftheir autistic child.
OL,10,FAlana McKane is four years old, and
OL,11,Fher condition means she is often non-
OL,12,Fverbal and prone to violent outbursts.
OL,14,FThe situation has left her parents,
OL,15,FChantelle and Ady, constantly needing
OL,16,Fto restrain her and protect her from
OL,17,Fherself.

OL,11,FAlana attends school but often ends
