OL,10,FBusiness owner Jo Corder said: "Every
OL,11,Ftime you find a pothole you think how
OL,12,Fclose was that, how dangerous was that?
OL,14,F"Then you see them patch it up and
OL,15,Fthat takes away our flights, the
OL,16,Fflights then aren't happening and
OL,17,Fpeople are disappointed- they are

OL,20,FJo added: "It is so disheartening to
OL,21,Fpeople trying to make this island work.

OL,11,FRepairs to Alderney's airport and
OL,12,Frunway have been ongoing since 1967,
OL,13,Fbut in 2019, the States of Guernsey

OL,17,FThe budget was doubled in 2022 with

OL,19,Fand runway extension.
