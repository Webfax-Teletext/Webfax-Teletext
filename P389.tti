OL,6,FA new report has highlighted concerns
OL,7,Faround the "unfair" funding of
OL,8,Fapprenticeships in Jersey.
OL,10,FEmployers and training providers told
OL,11,FPolicy Officers for the government
OL,12,Fthat "the support for higher level
OL,13,Fapprenticeships was disproportionately
OL,14,Fmore generous compared to lower level
OL,15,Ftraining".
OL,17,FThe review found that participants
OL,18,Ffelt that the current funding method
OL,19,Ffor level 2 and 3 apprenticeships is
OL,20,F"unfair" compared to other education
OL,21,Foptions at the same level.
