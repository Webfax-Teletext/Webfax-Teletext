OL,6,FJersey Airport is being accused of a
OL,7,Fcover-up after a government minister
OL,8,Frevealed that staff missed a bomb
OL,9,Fthreat, eventually evacuating the
OL,10,Fterminal more than seven hours later.
OL,12,FDeputy Ian Gorst confirmed that an
OL,13,Femail was sent to the airport's
OL,14,Fcustomer enquiries inbox at 11:16pm on
OL,15,FTuesday 4 March, but it is only
OL,16,Fmonitored during operational hours -
OL,17,F5:30am to 9pm - so officials
OL,18,Fdiscovered the threat the next morning
OL,19,Fduring standard opening checks.
