OL,7,FThe Farmers Association say a shortage
OL,8,Fof butchers on the island is causing
OL,9,Fconcern for the industry.
OL,11,FMichael Bray, who heads the
OL,12,Fassociation, says a shortage of
OL,13,Fbutchers means fewer people farm
OL,14,Fanimals such as pigs.
OL,16,FPrime cuts fetch higher prices but
OL,17,Fincreasingly local meat ends up as
OL,18,Fmince. As a result, the profit an
OL,19,Findividual cow can produce are reduced.

OL,7,FTen years ago, Guernsey's abattoir

OL,11,FSteve Robert, owner of Cobo Butchers,
OL,12,Fhas been butchering meat for more than
OL,13,F50 years and says butchery is a dying
OL,14,Ftrade: "There's nobody coming through
OL,15,Fnow.
OL,17,F"It's very hands on and very manual
OL,18,Fwork - and people don't tend to like
OL,19,Fthat nowadays.
