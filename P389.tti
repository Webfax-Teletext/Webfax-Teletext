OL,7,FThe UK Envoy said: "Numbers matter
OL,8,Fbecause the truth matters. The dead
OL,9,Fdeserve the dignity of the truth; the
OL,10,Fresidents of Alderney deserve accurate
OL,11,Fnumbers to free them from the
OL,12,Fdistortion of conspiracy theorists."
OL,14,FHe added: "Exaggerating the numbers of
OL,15,Fthe dead, or even minimising them, is
OL,16,Fin itself a form of Holocaust
OL,17,Fdistortion and a critical threat to
OL,18,FHolocaust memory."
OL,20,FThe review's findings are due to be
OL,21,Fpublished next month.
