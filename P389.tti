OL,6,FHe blamed inflation, Brexit, the
OL,7,Fpandemic and global conflicts as
OL,8,F"significant hurdles" that the
OL,9,Findustry has faced over the past five
OL,10,Fyears.
OL,12,FMr Cox added the CI Coop has resisted
OL,13,Fincreasing prices on many everyday
OL,14,Fitems to protect its members as
OL,15,Fhousehold budgets are under pressure.
OL,17,FHowever, in absorbing some of those
OL,18,F"relentless" costs, Mr Cox said the
OL,19,Fsociety's net surplus or profit will
OL,20,Fbe "notably reduced" in its end-of-
OL,21,Fyear financial report.
