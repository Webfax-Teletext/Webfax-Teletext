OL,6,FThere are claims older people in the
OL,7,Fare delaying their retirement because
OL,8,Fthey cannot afford to live on just
OL,9,Ftheir state pension.
OL,11,F87-year-old John Cooper works at an
OL,12,Fantique store in St Helier and told
OL,13,FITV News that he continues working for
OL,14,Fenjoyment and financial reasons.
OL,16,FHe said: "My youngest is 17, and I
OL,17,Falso have a daughter at university,
OL,18,Fstudying Nursing. I could survive, but
OL,19,Fif you want to live and have one or
OL,20,Ftwo luxuries occasionally, it's nice
OL,21,Fif you can carry on working."
