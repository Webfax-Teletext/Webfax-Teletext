OL,6,FConstable Andy Jehan, Jersey's

OL,13,Fnew, vibrant area where both locals
OL,14,Fand visitors can enjoy themselves
OL,15,Fthroughout the year, and I think

OL,18,F"It will be quicker, it'll be safer,
OL,19,Fand it will also be cheaper for us to
OL,20,Fredevelop - we hope to open in the
