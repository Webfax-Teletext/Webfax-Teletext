OL,6,FIt's chairman, Paul Bourgaize, says
OL,7,Fthis one is different to others: "When
OL,8,Fwe initially opened it up it was a
OL,9,Freally unique set up. There's a deep
OL,10,Fset of entry steps that shouldn't be
OL,11,Fthere. That in itself is very exciting.
OL,13,F"There's so much reinforced concrete
OL,14,Fgone into this one. It's also a huge
OL,15,Fhole that they would have had to
OL,16,Fexcavate to start with."

OL,6,FIt's believed the bunker was filled in

OL,8,Fwill make a great addition to the
