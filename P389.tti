OL,7,FIn her spacious office in Broad

OL,11,FAfter the heated that forced her out
OL,12,Fof office, she now has the laborious
OL,13,Ftask of clearing her desk to make way
OL,14,Ffor next Chief Minister.
OL,16,FWhen I ask her what went wrong, she
OL,17,Ffocuses on the assembly that voted
OL,18,Fagainst her.

OL,7,FThe starting gun for her political
OL,8,Fdownfall was fired by the constant
OL,9,Fcritic in her government, , the former
OL,10,FInfrastructure Minister.
OL,12,FNow she reveals that she had written a

OL,14,Fit, something she thinks was a mistake.
OL,16,F"That was written months ago, but I

OL,19,Ffind a way forward".

OL,7,FIt was an error that led to her losing

OL,9,Fallegations in the States, including
OL,10,Fthat had been seen leaving the Chief

OL,13,FShe continues to argue that they had a
