OL,7,Ftheir concerns over being taxed twice
OL,8,Fare not being acted on.
OL,10,FIt comes as a petition, that received
OL,11,Fmore than 5,000 signatures, called for
OL,12,Fthe States of Jersey to debate whether
OL,13,Fdouble-taxing pensions should be
OL,14,Fabolished.
OL,16,FThe petition stated: "All employed
OL,17,Fpersons are obliged by law to pay
OL,18,Fsocial security contributions.
OL,19,FContributions are not deducted from
OL,20,Fgross pay for taxation purposes.

OL,6,F"At pensionable age, such pensions

OL,12,FIn its original response, the States
OL,13,Fresponded that even though the old age
OL,14,Fpension is taxable, pensioners on low
OL,15,Fincomes who receive only the old age

OL,17,Fadding that making the States old age
