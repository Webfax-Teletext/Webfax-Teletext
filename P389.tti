OL,6,FIn the men's contest Guernsey were
OL,7,Fsimply too hot to handle. They started
OL,8,Ffast with three early tries and from
OL,9,Fthere Jersey were always playing catch
OL,10,Fup. The hosts led 28-14 at the break
OL,11,Fand continued their dominance after
OL,12,Fthe restart, eventually running out 49-
OL,13,F33 winners.
OL,15,F"I don't think people understand the
OL,16,Femotion that goes into this" said
OL,17,FGuernsey boss Jordan Reynolds
OL,18,Ffollowing the win. "I've been pretty
OL,19,Fmiserable for the past month trying to
OL,20,Fprepare this game. This is not just a
OL,21,Fsport, it's a way of life."

OL,6,FJersey head coach Myles Landick made

OL,8,F"When you come to Footes Lane it's
OL,9,Falways a very difficult atmosphere and
OL,10,Fif you're not on your game that can

OL,12,FGuernsey they came out all guns
OL,13,Fblazing and the first half really hurt

OL,16,FThe women's contest was one of the
OL,17,Fgreat Siam Cup contests. For a long
OL,18,Fperiod it looked as though Jersey
OL,19,Fwould retain the cup and pick up their
OL,20,Ffirst Siam triumph away from home.
