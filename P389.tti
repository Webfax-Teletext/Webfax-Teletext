OL,6,FHundreds of drivers in Guernsey could
OL,7,Fbe unknowingly breaking the law due to
OL,8,Fthe weight of their vehicles.
OL,10,FUnder the Road Traffic 1987 law, any
OL,11,Fnon-commercial automobile that weighs
OL,12,Fover two tonnes and exceeds 25mph is
OL,13,Fbreaking the law.
OL,15,FHowever, there are concerns from the
OL,16,FCommittee for Home Affairs that this
OL,17,Flaw is not being enforced enough.

OL,6,FOne said that because of the island's
OL,7,Fnarrow roads, it "might be advisable
OL,8,Fthat (larger cars) stuck to something

OL,8,Fpedestrian death as a result of a

OL,10,F5.5 times more likely than at traffic

OL,14,FHowever, a three-year research project
OL,15,Fby Queen's University Belfast found
OL,16,Fthat their city's roll-out of 20mph
OL,17,Fspeed limits impacted traffic volumes
