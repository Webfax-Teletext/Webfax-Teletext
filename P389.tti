OL,6,FPatients in Jersey have been
OL,7,Fresuscitated against their wishes and
OL,8,Fgiven medications they are allergic to
OL,9,Fdue to a poorly integrated medical
OL,10,Frecords system.
OL,12,FThe revelations came from the health
OL,13,Fdepartment's Chief Information
OL,14,FOfficer, Martin Carpenter, during a
OL,15,Fscrutiny panel meeting.
OL,17,FHe said: "In the hospital, we're
OL,18,Frecording an average of about 80
OL,19,Fpatient safety incidents a month as a
OL,20,Fresult of fragmented data.

OL,6,F"We've had 'do not resuscitate' on a

OL,11,FThe issues stem from there being no
