OL,6,FA former Jersey Chief Minister has
OL,7,Ffailed in their bid to change how the
OL,8,Fperson for the top job is selected.
OL,10,FDeputy Kristina Moore proposed that
OL,11,Fthe Chief Minister should be elected
OL,12,Fthrough an island-wide vote, which
OL,13,Fwould be held in parallel with the
OL,14,FGeneral Election, rather than being
OL,15,Fselected after polling day by fellow
OL,16,Fpoliticians.
OL,18,FHowever, not a single one of her
OL,19,Fcolleagues supported the move - with
OL,20,F43 votes against. Deputy Moore was the
OL,21,Fonly one to vote in favour.

OL,6,FDeputy Sir Philip Bailhache called the

OL,9,FThe Housing Minister, Deputy Sam

OL,11,Flooking to change the electoral
OL,12,Fsystem, which he described as
OL,13,F"inadequate".
