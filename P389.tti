OL,7,FDeputy Kazantseva-Miller says: "It
OL,8,Fbecame clear very quickly that the
OL,9,Findustry was facing many challenges
OL,10,Fthat were making it difficult to meet
OL,11,Fthe current childcare demand, never

OL,13,Fand number of spaces available if
OL,14,Fchildcare policies were extended.""We
OL,15,Fsaw that it was premature to run
OL,16,Fbefore we could walk in, that we could
OL,17,Fnot progress the ambition behind our
OL,18,Famendment before the States could
OL,19,Fdevelop a better understanding of the
OL,20,Fchallenges facing the childcare
OL,21,Fproviders and how these could be
OL,22,Faddressed."The review will consult
OL,23,Fwith people working in the childcare
OL,24,Fsector to listen to their concerns in
OL,25,Fa bid to work out how to address them.
