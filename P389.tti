OL,6,FCool easterly winds can be a

OL,8,Fnot far from our shortest day of the

OL,10,Fhours and therefore a limited
OL,11,Fopportunity for our temperatures to
OL,12,Fclimb during the day.
OL,14,FThe sun also sits low in the sky at
OL,15,Fthis time of year, meaning the
OL,16,Fsunlight is very weak. UV only reaches
OL,17,Faround UV1 at midday in January, which
OL,18,Fis equivalent to the strength of the

OL,12,FThat being said, our winters are far
