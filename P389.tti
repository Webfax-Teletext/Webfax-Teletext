OL,8,Ffinished excavating stone from Les

OL,10,Fsince 1961.
OL,12,FPlans were passed in October of 2022
OL,13,Ffor the new site, but concerns were
OL,14,Fraised by nearby residents before its
OL,15,Fapproval regarding the impact on

OL,18,FIt's hoped the nine-acre site at

OL,20,Ftonnes of granite from the headland,
OL,21,Fwhich could take up to 40 years.
