OL,6,FA Guernsey mother who has two
OL,7,Fdaughters with autism says "people
OL,8,Fhave no idea what it's like", amid
OL,9,Fcalls for extra support for parents.
OL,11,FAntonia Rainbow set up the 'Autism &
OL,12,FMe' Facebook group in 2023 for local
OL,13,Fcarers of neurodiverse children as she
OL,14,Fbelieves while the island's system for
OL,15,Fdiagnosing young people with autism
OL,16,Fhas improved, more needs to be done to
OL,17,Fassist parents.
OL,19,FAntonia tells ITV News: "If someone
OL,20,Fspent the day in your shoes, they just
OL,21,Fwouldn't believe it.

OL,6,FAntonia explains that neurodiversity
OL,7,Faffects people differently and often
OL,8,Fmakes it hard for her daughters to
OL,9,Fjoin in socially.
OL,11,FShe says: "There are no summer

OL,15,F"There is nowhere that you can leave
