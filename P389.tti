OL,3,CWhat are these jellyfish-like
OL,4,Ccreatures washing up on beaches?
OL,6,FThey are 'colonial hydriods' which
OL,7,Fmeans they are made up of a number of

OL,9,Fto prey on young fish and other
OL,10,Fsmaller creatures.
OL,12,FVelella velella are often called 'By-
OL,13,Fthe-wind-sailors' owing to an
OL,14,Fattachment they have which resembles a
OL,15,Fsail and determines which direction
