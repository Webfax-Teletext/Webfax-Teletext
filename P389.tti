OL,6,F'It's beggars belief that people are
OL,7,Fthat stupid. If you were on a motorway
OL,8,Fin the UK, you wouldn't be doing those

OL,10,Flike that here. It's just so
OL,11,Fdangerous.'
OL,13,FHe added: "Drug and alcohol driving is
OL,14,Fan issue. With Christmas coming up
OL,15,Fthat usually peaks."
OL,17,FEven though incidents of speeding have
OL,18,Frisen in Jersey, the honorary police
OL,19,Fare struggling to recruit new
OL,20,Fvolunteers to help catch those
