OL,6,FPeople in Jersey are calling for the
OL,7,Fplanning system to be simplified,
OL,8,Fsaying that the amount of red tape
OL,9,Finvolved is preventing essential
OL,10,Fprogress from being made.
OL,12,FFor planning permission to be granted
OL,13,Fon the island, people must complete a
OL,14,Fseries of checks - such as
OL,15,Farcheological surveys, nature surveys,
OL,16,Fand land surveys - and obtain a
OL,17,Fconsensus from a wide range of experts.
OL,19,FThey say this system creates
OL,20,Funnecessary bureaucracy and incurs
OL,21,Fcosts that can stall development.

OL,11,FBen Cairney, a construction firm
OL,12,Fdirector, says that whilst access to
OL,13,Fplanning officers has improved in
OL,14,Frecent years, the system itself is
OL,15,Fstill failing.
OL,17,FHe says: "The problem is the amount of

OL,19,Fthrough before, during, and after you
OL,20,Fget planning permission.

OL,12,FHe says: "What (the department) is not
