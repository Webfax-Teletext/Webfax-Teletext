OL,7,FProfessor Katerina Michaelides, from

OL,9,Fphenomenon can be particularly
OL,10,Fdifficult to cope with.
OL,12,F"Places that were historically wet are
OL,13,Fbecoming dry and vice versa," she
OL,14,Fexplained. "Other places are now
OL,15,Fincreasingly battered by both extreme

OL,17,Funderstanding of localized climate
OL,18,Fhazards can support more intelligent

OL,7,FThe other measure is vulnerability -
OL,8,Fhow geared up cities are to cope?
OL,9,FMadrid, Barcelona and Paris all score
OL,10,Fworse than cities in Australia and
OL,11,FAmerica, because of their aging
OL,12,Finfrastructure.
OL,14,FAnd it's a similar story in London -

OL,16,Flevel of drying is quite mild, our
OL,17,Fwater defences and storage aren't
