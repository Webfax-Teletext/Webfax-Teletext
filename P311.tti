OL,3,CWhy Rayner's job remains in peril
OL,5,FThe crucial section from Angela
OL,6,FRayner's statement on why she paid too
OL,7,Flittle stamp duty - around #40,000 too
OL,8,Flittle I understand - is this:
OL,10,F"When purchasing the property my
OL,11,Funderstanding, on advice from lawyers,
OL,12,Fwas that my circumstances meant I was
OL,13,Fliable for the standard rate of stamp
OL,14,Fduty."
OL,16,FIf she can prove she was given the
OL,17,Fwrong advice by a qualified solicitor,
OL,18,Fthen I assume both the PM's ethics
OL,19,Fadviser and the British people will
OL,20,Fgive her the benefit of the doubt.

OL,14,FAlthough, I am struggling to get my
OL,15,Fhead around the idea that any
