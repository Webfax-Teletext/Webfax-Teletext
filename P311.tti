OL,7,FThursday morning, everything looked
OL,8,Fvery normal.
OL,10,FA routine royal engagement to the film
OL,11,Fset of the ITV drama Trigger Point
OL,12,Fand, having been one of the reporters
OL,13,Fat the event, neither the Queen nor
OL,14,Fher staff looked rattled to me.
OL,16,FBut we now know that it was around
OL,17,Fthis time that the King was having to
OL,18,Fmake an unscheduled trip to hospital.

OL,6,FHe has regular cancer treatment. We
OL,7,Fare not told what it is or when he has
OL,8,Fit, but it happens, usually in London
OL,9,Fand often at his residence, Clarence
OL,10,FHouse.
OL,12,FBut something went wrong today which
OL,13,Fmade it necessary for him to go to the
OL,14,FLondon Clinic - the same hospital he
OL,15,Fattended more than a year ago for his
OL,16,Fprostate operation - which then led to
OL,17,Fthe discovery of his cancer.

OL,6,FIt's the kind of event he hosts all

OL,14,FThe King had to cancel a very routine
OL,15,Fmeeting with ambassadors on Thursday

OL,6,FThe big question for the King's

OL,10,FThe King and Queen are due to be
