OL,6,FAmerica was told about Joe Biden's
OL,7,Fcancer diagnosis late on Sunday
OL,8,Fafternoon, while the former President
OL,9,Fwas at his home in Wilmington,
OL,10,FDelaware.
OL,12,FWhile some of the details sound
OL,13,Fshocking, for instance, that his
OL,14,Fprostate cancer scored a 9 /10 on the
OL,15,FGleason aggressiveness scale and that
OL,16,Fit has spread to his bones, there is
OL,17,Falso some reason for cautious optimism.

OL,6,FThe statement says the cancer is
OL,7,Fhormone sensitive, which means it may
OL,8,Frespond well to drug treatment.
OL,9,FExperts think it is unlikely the 82-
OL,10,Fyear-old former President will undergo
OL,11,Fsurgery because the cancer has already

OL,15,Fabout one in eight men in the United
OL,16,FStates, will be managed through a
