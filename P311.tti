OL,6,FOne of England's leading medics has
OL,7,Fwarned of an "extraordinary" increase
OL,8,Fin abuse aimed at GP teams, which is
OL,9,Fpushing some family doctors to leave
OL,10,Fthe profession.
OL,12,FDr Claire Fuller, primary care medical
OL,13,Fdirector for NHS England, said it is
OL,14,Fnot acceptable to "bash" GPs, who are
OL,15,F"exhausted" and working "flat out",
OL,16,Fclaiming there has been a rise in
OL,17,Fattacks both physical and verbal.

OL,6,F"When you talk to GPs about why they

OL,11,F"It has now become acceptable to bash

OL,13,Fthat from every GP I speak to. And
OL,14,Fpeople do leave because they've just

OL,17,FDr Fuller added: "So if you think

OL,19,F(they) will get a phone call from a
