OL,6,FStorm Chandra arrived at a point when
OL,7,Flarge parts of the UK were already
OL,8,Fvulnerable.
OL,10,FHuge swathes of the UK had been
OL,11,Fsaturated by weeks of persistent
OL,12,Frainfall, leaving little capacity for
OL,13,Fthe ground to absorb more water.
OL,15,FWhen Chandra brought further heavy
OL,16,Frain, rapid runoff into rivers and
OL,17,Fdrainage systems made localised
OL,18,Fflooding an inevitability.

OL,6,FThis is a crucial point often missed

OL,6,FIs this flooding the result of climate

OL,9,FWhile Storm Chandra itself cannot be

OL,12,Flikely certainly can.
OL,14,FWithout a doubt, climate change is

OL,17,FThis is because a warmer atmosphere
OL,18,Fcan hold more moisture (around 7% more
