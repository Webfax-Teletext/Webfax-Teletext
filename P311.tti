OL,7,Fhas spoken out about being the show's

OL,12,FSamira appeared on season 4 back in
OL,13,F2018 and says the lack of diversity
OL,14,Fwas clear from the start.
OL,16,F"I even asked a producer, 'Do you
OL,17,Fthink it's because I'm Black?' They
OL,18,Fwere shocked ` but it was obvious
OL,19,Fafter a few weeks. I wasn't anyone's
OL,20,Ftype," she told ITV News.

OL,11,F"When I came out of Love Island, I
