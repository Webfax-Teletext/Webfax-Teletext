OL,3,CHow new brain scanning technology
OL,4,Ccould help detect conditions early
OL,6,FIt's been developed at the University
OL,7,Fof Nottingham. It was there 50 years
OL,8,Fago Sir Peter Mansfield invented
OL,9,FMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). That
OL,10,Fhas become a mainstay of medical
OL,11,Fscanning. This is different.
OL,13,F"MRI is exceptional technology," Matt
OL,14,FBrookes, Professor of Physics at
OL,15,FNottingham told me. "It can make
OL,16,Fstructural images of your brain with
OL,17,Fmillimeter precision but what it can't
OL,18,Fdo is measure the electrical activity
OL,19,Fin your brain. And that's what our new
OL,20,Fpiece of kit does."

OL,6,FHow it works
OL,8,FThe OPM-MEG system uses quantum
OL,9,Ftechnology to monitor the electrical
OL,10,Fsignals passed around the brain.
OL,11,FInside each sensor is a gas of atoms
OL,12,Fwhose magnetic properties have been
OL,13,Faltered by a laser. Magnetic fields
OL,14,Ffrom our brain's activity changes how
OL,15,Fthe atoms move and by measuring that
OL,16,Fscientists can monitor brain activity.

OL,6,FThe benefit of the new technology is
OL,7,Fthat it's lightweight, cheaper and you
OL,8,Fcan move while wearing it. In one test
OL,9,FI'm asked to turn on the spot.
OL,10,FScientists monitor my brain activity
OL,11,Fin real-time. If I had early
OL,12,FParkinsons they would be able to
OL,13,Fdetect signs of disease from my neural
OL,14,Fresponses.
OL,16,FIn another test, I hold two fingers
OL,17,Fonto braille sensors which tingle when
OL,18,Factivated. The data is then analysed
OL,19,Fby Dr Karen Mullinger and her team.
