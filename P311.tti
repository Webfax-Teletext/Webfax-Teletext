OL,6,FThe Chancellor has said he "won't take

OL,8,Fthe Budget as he looked to taper

OL,11,FJeremy Hunt told The Sunday Telegraph
OL,12,Fthat bringing down the current tax
OL,13,Fburden is a "long path".
OL,15,FHe also confirmed that the financial
OL,16,Fforecasts setting out how much so-
OL,17,Fcalled "headroom" he has in order to
OL,18,Fmeet his fiscal rules had "gone
OL,19,Fagainst us", in a move that is likely
OL,20,Fto curtail his ability to serve up pre-
