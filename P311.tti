OL,7,Fcompanies who make the decision when
OL,8,Fit comes to a hosepipe ban.
OL,10,FTypically, a ban may be considered
OL,11,Fwhen rainfall has been well below
OL,12,Faverage for several weeks or months,
OL,13,Fwhen reservoir and groundwater levels

OL,5,FThe length of a hosepipe ban depends
OL,6,Fon weather conditions and how quickly
OL,7,Fwater sources recover. In past years,
OL,8,Fbans have lasted from a few weeks to
OL,9,Fseveral months.
OL,11,FIn 2022, when we experienced three
OL,12,Fheatwaves in as many months and
OL,13,Ftemperatures exceeded 40C, a ban was
OL,14,Fintroduced across parts of southern
OL,15,FEngland and remained in place through
