OL,3,CJohn Kerry: Path to peace in Ukraine
OL,4,Cstill possible amid ceasefire talks
OL,6,FFormer US Secretary of State John
OL,7,FKerry has said he still sees a
OL,8,Fpossible path to peace in Ukraine, as
OL,9,Ftalks over a US-brokered ceasefire
OL,10,Fbetween Kyiv and Moscow continue.
OL,12,FThis comes after US media reports
OL,13,Fsuggesting Ukraine has agreed to a US-
OL,14,Fbrokered peace plan to end its war
OL,15,Fwith Russia.
OL,17,FSpeaking at Chatham House in London on
OL,18,FTuesday, Kerry told ITV News that any
OL,19,Fdeal would require both sides to be at
OL,20,Fthe negotiating table, but only after
OL,21,Fa ceasefire is agreed.

OL,9,Fhe said.
OL,11,F"You need to get a ceasefire, I mean,

OL,14,F"Another starting place is to lay out
