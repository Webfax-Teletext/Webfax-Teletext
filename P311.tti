OL,12,FOne of my abiding memories of doing
OL,13,Fthis job was three years ago when I
OL,14,Fwas filming in Stratford-upon-Avon.
OL,16,FI was doing an interview with author
OL,17,FMaggie O'Farrell about her best

OL,19,Fthe stage with the Royal Shakespeare

OL,6,FWe were in the room where it's thought
OL,7,FShakespeare may have been born, at the
OL,8,Ffamous house in the town.
OL,10,FStanding by the bed talking to Maggie
OL,11,Fabout her book, one of the best I've
OL,12,Fever read, I turned to look behind me
OL,13,F- and did a double take.
OL,15,FBecause there leaning across the
OL,16,Fdoorway to the bedroom was director
OL,17,FChloe Zhao listening in to us.
OL,19,FI immediately asked Maggie, "Are they
OL,20,Fmaking a film of your book? Is Chloe
OL,21,Fdirecting?"
