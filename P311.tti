OL,6,FThe jump in Consumer Prices Index
OL,7,F(CPI) inflation to 3% has taken
OL,8,Fanalysts a little by surprise (it was
OL,9,Fexpected to hit 2.8%). But it may not
OL,10,Fbe quite as bad as it looks.
OL,12,FThe rise in food and non-alcoholic
OL,13,Fdrink inflation to 3.3% is definitely
OL,14,Fconcerning because it hits the poorest
OL,15,Fhouseholds the hardest.
OL,17,FBut the other two big drivers of this
OL,18,Fjump are unlikely to have the same
OL,19,Feffect next month.

OL,4,Cto 3% may not be as bad as it looks
OL,6,FOne is airfares - usually those take-

OL,8,Fplunge back down again in January.
OL,10,FBut for technical reasons the price
OL,11,Fincrease in December 2024 was nowhere
OL,12,Fnear as pronounced as usual and so the
OL,13,Fsubsequent drop in January 2025 was
OL,14,Falso smaller.
OL,16,FAnother major driver was the VAT which
OL,17,Fthe government slapped on private
OL,18,Fschool fees from January. That pushed
OL,19,Fthose up by a hefty 13%.

OL,6,FAlthough some of that effect might
OL,7,Fstill be felt next month (depending on
OL,8,Fwhen the bills go through), it is
OL,9,Fgenerally considered a one-off effect
OL,10,Fas a result of a policy decision and
OL,11,Ftherefore not integral to the overall
OL,12,Finflationary picture.
OL,14,FThis pair of unusual features -
OL,15,Fairfares and school fees - means the
OL,16,FBank of England may be less likely to
OL,17,Fhold interest rates higher for longer
OL,18,Fas a result of Wednesday's CPI.

OL,7,Finflation is still expected to rise
OL,8,Fthis year (to 3.7% thinks the Bank),
