OL,6,FRodri - The Manchester City midfielder
OL,7,Fhas been a standout performer for club
OL,8,Fand country for several years now.
OL,9,FRodri showed with his strike against
OL,10,FGeorgia in the round of 16 that he
OL,11,Fposes a real goal threat to go

OL,13,FHe is likely to come face-to-face with
