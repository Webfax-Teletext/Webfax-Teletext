OL,4,Cso long this year?
OL,6,FAfter what has seemed to be an
OL,7,Finterminable winter, spring is finally
OL,8,Fupon us with sunshine on the cards for
OL,9,Fmuch of the UK this weekend.
OL,11,FWhen is the official start of spring?
OL,13,FThere are two answers to that and it
OL,14,Fseems to be personal preference!
OL,15,Fmeteorologically speaking, with our
OL,16,Ffirst spring month being March.
OL,18,FHowever, some believe that spring is
OL,19,Fheralded in by the Vernal Equinox on
OL,20,FMarch 20.

OL,6,FWhy has winter felt so long this year?
OL,8,FOn the face of it, winter has been
OL,9,Frelatively unremarkable; a touch
OL,10,Fwarmer than average and somewhat drier
OL,11,Fthan average - Northern Ireland in
OL,12,Fparticular have seen a dry season with
OL,13,Fonly 70% of their expected rainfall.
OL,15,FHowever, that sense of never-ending
OL,16,Fwinter is almost certainly because of
OL,17,Fthe lack of sunshine - particularly in
OL,18,FEngland where sunshine amounts were
OL,19,Fdown by almost a fifth.

OL,6,FThese gloomy stats exacerbated by,
