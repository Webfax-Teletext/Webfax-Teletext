OL,6,FThat came only days after ITV News
OL,7,Freported that only 100 spaces were
OL,8,Fleft in male prisons in the UK,
OL,9,Ffollowing the August bank holiday

OL,12,FThe government are deeply concerned by
OL,13,Fwhat could happen if prison spaces run
OL,14,Fout.
OL,16,FLord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood, when
OL,17,Fshe announced the measures, warned
OL,18,Fthat police could even have to stop
OL,19,Fcarrying out arrests in a worst case
OL,20,Fscenario, possibly leading to looting
OL,21,Fand the collapse of law and order.

OL,13,FWhat is the plan?
OL,15,FTo free up space in prisons, the

OL,18,Fserving only 40% of their sentence

OL,3,CWhy are thousands of prisoners to be
OL,4,Creleased early from UK jails?
OL,6,FThe first set of prisoners to be
OL,7,Freleased from the September 10 are
OL,8,Fthose who were given sentences of five
OL,9,Fyears or less.
OL,11,FThere are exceptions, however. Those
OL,12,Fserving sentences for sex and violent
OL,13,Foffences are excluded, as are some
OL,14,Foffences related to domestic violence.
OL,16,FA total of 5,500 prisoners are
OL,17,Fexpected to be let out, along with a
OL,18,Fsecond release from October of those
OL,19,Fserving five years or more.
OL,21,FAre there risks?

OL,3,CWhy are thousands of prisoners to be

OL,6,FYes. The justice secretary admitted as
OL,7,Fmuch when announcing the measures, and
OL,8,Fsince then, experts including the
OL,9,Fchief inspector of probation have
OL,10,Fwarned that the plans amount to
OL,11,F"rolling the dice".
OL,13,FConcerns centre around whether those
OL,14,Freleased will go onto reoffend, but
OL,15,Falso the strain releasing thousands of
OL,16,Fpeople early could put on services,
OL,17,Fincluding those for the homeless.
OL,19,FThe government insists that they have
OL,20,Fno other option and "do not take this
OL,21,Fdecision lightly".

OL,11,FWhy have prisons become full?
OL,13,FExperts say a combination of longer
OL,14,Fsentences for crimes, the creation of
OL,15,Fnew offences, record numbers of
OL,16,Freleased prisoners being recalled, and
OL,17,FCovid court backlogs have all

OL,6,FEven with new prisons being built,
OL,7,Fprojections show that prison
OL,8,Fpopulations will grow faster.
OL,10,FThis new scheme replaces a previous
OL,11,Fplan implemented by the last
OL,12,FConservative government in 2023 to
OL,13,Frelease some prisoners ten weeks early.
OL,15,FBut with warnings of prisons becoming
OL,16,Ffull within days, the new
OL,17,Fadministration felt they had to take
OL,18,Ffurther action.
