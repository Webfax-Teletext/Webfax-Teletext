OL,3,CWill Iran step back? The West hopes
OL,4,Cso, but the region doubts it
OL,6,FToday, Western sources tell me Iran's
OL,7,Fleadership may be considering leaving
OL,8,Fany retaliation to Lebanon-based
OL,9,FHezbollah and other proxies in the
OL,10,Fregion and thus, not repeating April's
OL,11,Fdirect strike on Israel.
OL,13,FHowever, those in the region say they
OL,14,Fdon't think that is Iran's position.
OL,15,FWhy does this matter?
OL,17,FWell, if the Western assessment plays
OL,18,Fout in reality, it is significant.

OL,6,FIf Iran is considering delegating the
OL,7,Fresponsibility of response to
OL,8,FHezbollah, it reduces the risk of
OL,9,Fmassive escalation through a state on
OL,10,Fstate attack.
OL,12,FA Hezbollah attack - likely supported
OL,13,Fby the Houthis and others - would
OL,14,Fstill be a very big deal but
OL,15,Fmarginally less inflammatory than one
OL,16,Ffrom Tehran itself.
OL,18,FWhat comes next very much depends on

OL,13,FHowever other sources, closer to Iran,
