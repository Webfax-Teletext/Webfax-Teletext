OL,11,Fthe party's 1997 victory, 'Things Can

OL,9,Fsaid they were hoping for from Keir

OL,12,FAnd his speech was certainly more
OL,13,Fupbeat than the one he delivered in
OL,14,Fthe Downing Street garden, where his
OL,15,Fdeep focus on the party's economic
OL,16,Finheritance, and how difficult things
OL,17,Fare about to become, led to a sense
OL,18,Fthat the new PM had told the country -

OL,6,FToday, Starmer offered a much more
OL,7,Foptimistic vision under the idea of
OL,8,F'change begins' in a speech that
OL,9,Fstressed the Labour nature of his
OL,10,Fgovernment (notably getting standing
OL,11,Fovations for the more left-wing parts
OL,12,Fof the agenda including workers'
OL,13,Frights, rail nationalisation and a
OL,14,FGaza ceasefire).
OL,16,FAnd Starmer was more personal and
OL,17,Fdelivered the crescendo of the speech
OL,18,Fin a way I've rarely seen before.

OL,6,FDowning Street had heard the
OL,7,Fcomplaints, but they weren't changing
OL,8,Fthe entire message. As one senior aide
OL,9,Fsaid - we shifted the treble and the
OL,10,Fbase, but the tune was the same.
OL,12,FAnd it is true that Starmer still had
OL,13,Fa negative message - around the idea
OL,14,Fthat the country was suffering from
OL,15,Fanxiety and that every change required
OL,16,Fdifficult compromises - such as
OL,17,Fprisons near communities to solve the
OL,18,Fjustice crisis, or pylons above ground
OL,19,Fto spread green energy.

OL,9,FCertainly, his cabinet was spinning

OL,12,FBut it is still the case that Labour

OL,14,Fscandals around clothing budgets and
OL,15,Fstaff pay that went unmentioned.

OL,6,FToday was Starmer's attempt to lift
OL,7,Fhis party.
OL,9,FWhether it will work might depend on
OL,10,Fthe substance, however.
OL,12,FIt was moving when he said he wanted
OL,13,Fhis carer sister to be given as much
OL,14,Frespect as him as PM.
OL,16,FBut the evidence of whether he really
OL,17,Fbelieves that will be when we find out
OL,18,Fwhat the government's fair pay for
OL,19,Fcarers really looks like.
