OL,7,FHigh street fashion retailer Zara has
OL,8,Fbeen labelled "socially irresponsible"
OL,9,Fby the advertising watchdog after it
OL,10,Fused photos of models who appeared to
OL,11,Fbe unhealthily thin to advertise its
OL,12,Fclothes.
OL,14,FThe two product listings on the Zara
OL,15,Fwebsite in May featured an image of a
OL,16,Fmodel wearing an oversized pocket
OL,17,Fshirt and another of a model wearing a
OL,18,Fvoluminous combined short dress.

OL,7,FThe Advertising Standards Authority
OL,8,F(ASA) received one complaint that the
OL,9,Fads were irresponsible because the
OL,10,Fmodels appeared to be unhealthily thin.
OL,12,FZara said the models had worked for
OL,13,Fwell-known and reputable fashion
OL,14,Fbrands and confirmed that both models
OL,15,Fhad medical certification, which
OL,16,Fproved they were in good health.
OL,18,FThey said that none of the images had
OL,19,Fbeen modified, beyond very minor
OL,20,Flighting and colouring edits.

OL,7,FZara confirmed that it had amended the

OL,9,Fcomplaint and removed the specific
OL,10,Fimages.
OL,12,FThe ASA said the low-cut design of the
OL,13,Fshirt in the first ad drew attention
OL,14,Fto the model's upper chest area,
OL,15,Fcreating a focal point around her
OL,16,Fcollarbone, which was protruding.
OL,18,FIn addition, the positioning of her
OL,19,Farms, while wearing a baggy shirt,
OL,20,Fcreated the impression that her arms,
OL,21,Fshoulders and chest were very slim.

OL,16,Fcreated the impression that the model
