OL,12,FThere is probably some scope to borrow

OL,6,FReeves's belated reworking of the debt
OL,7,Ffiscal rules would only create
OL,8,Fadditional borrowing space for much-

OL,10,Fbe seen as welcome - but not for day-

OL,13,FSo, on my rough calculations the

OL,15,Fbillion from expenditure cuts.
OL,17,FRight now I can't see how Reeves
OL,18,Fescapes measures - spending cuts -
OL,19,Fthat will look and feel a lot like the
