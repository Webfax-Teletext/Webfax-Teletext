OL,8,Fso it's even a topic for him and the
OL,9,FFirst Lady.
OL,11,FAfter a day in the office he tells her
OL,12,Fhe had a nice chat with Vladimir but
OL,13,Fthen when she puts the TV on, she says
OL,14,F"Oh really, he's bombed a nursing
OL,15,Fhome", which upsets the President.
OL,17,FHow's that for a glimpse of geo-
OL,18,Fpolitics Chez Trump?
