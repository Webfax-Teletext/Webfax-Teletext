OL,6,FCardinals are set to gather in Rome's
OL,7,FSistine Chapel on Wednesday to form a
OL,8,Fconclave and vote for the next pope.
OL,10,FFor centuries, Conclave, meaning "with
OL,11,Fkey" in Latin, has seen cardinals
OL,12,Flocked away until they agree on a new
OL,13,Fpope, ensuring the process is shrouded
OL,14,Fin secrecy and hidden from public view.
OL,16,FSo, how will people know when a new
OL,17,Fpope has been chosen?

OL,6,FThe tradition of using smoke dates

OL,9,Fto mark the result was at the 1903

OL,12,FHow is the smoke created?
OL,14,FInside the Sistine Chapel, two stoves

OL,16,Fconclave, both connected to a flue - a
OL,17,Fpipe within a chimney - that leads the
OL,18,Fsmoke up through the chapel roof and
OL,19,Foutside.
