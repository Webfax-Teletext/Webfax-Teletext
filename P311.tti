OL,6,FSeen through an election lens, the
OL,7,Fsolution on which both main parties
OL,8,Fagree is that Britain needs to build
OL,9,Fmore homes.
OL,11,FWe do not have enough places for
OL,12,Fpeople to live - the UK is more than
OL,13,Ffour million homes short of what it
OL,14,Fneeds - and the human consequences are
OL,15,Fdire.
OL,17,FIt is easy to say you will build more,
OL,18,Fbut no government of any colour in
OL,19,Frecent years can claim a particularly
OL,20,Fgreat record on housebuilding.
