OL,7,FHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has
OL,8,Fasked for "reassurances" from the
OL,9,FGeneral Medical Council (GMC) after it
OL,10,Fwas reported that doctors who changed
OL,11,Fgender could have their disciplinary
OL,12,Frecords erased.
OL,14,FThe Daily Telegraph reported that the
OL,15,FGMC had confirmed doctors who change
OL,16,Ftheir gender identity were issued with
OL,17,Fa new registration and GMC number,
OL,18,Fwith no links to their previous
OL,19,Fregistration on the watchdog's public
OL,20,Fregister.
