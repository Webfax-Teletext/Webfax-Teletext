OL,6,FSir Keir Starmer has defended the
OL,7,Fgovernment's decision to ditch plans
OL,8,Fto delay elections across 30 local
OL,9,Fauthorities this May, saying the
OL,10,Fdecision was "locally led".
OL,12,F"I think it's important to remind
OL,13,Fourselves that the decision to cancel
OL,14,Fwas a locally-led decision in the
OL,15,Fsense that each authority could
OL,16,Fdecide," he told reporters in Wales.
OL,18,F"And, yes, Labour authorities came
OL,19,Fforward to say, 'please delay'. But so
OL,20,Fdid Tory authorities, so did Lib Dem
OL,21,Fauthorities."
