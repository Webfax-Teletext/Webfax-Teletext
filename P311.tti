OL,3,CLord Mandelson: What are the business
OL,4,Cinterests of the potential US
OL,5,Cambassador?
OL,7,FAs I mentioned on last week's Talking
OL,8,FPolitics, Lord Mandelson may well be
OL,9,Fappointed as Keir Starmer's person in
OL,10,FWashington, British ambassador to the
OL,11,FUS - though I am told no decision or
OL,12,Fannouncement is imminent.
OL,14,FGiven that so much of the
OL,15,Fambassadorial job will be to promote
OL,16,Fthe UK's economic interests - and this
OL,17,Fmay well be even more important with
OL,18,Fprotectionist Trump in the White House
OL,19,F- I took a look at Mandelson's
OL,20,Fbusiness interests, in case they are
OL,21,Frelevant to his appointment.

OL,15,FBut as I said, here is what stood out.
OL,16,FThe official register shows that in
