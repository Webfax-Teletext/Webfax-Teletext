OL,6,FNASA has had to delay its highly
OL,7,Fanticipated flight yet over a new
OL,8,Fproblem with its rocket in the latest
OL,9,Fsetback for the Artemis II mission to
OL,10,Fthe moon.
OL,12,FApril is now the earliest that the
OL,13,Ffour Artemis II astronauts are
OL,14,Fexpected to fly to the moon, the space
OL,15,Fagency said on Saturday,
OL,17,FNASA revealed the latest problem just
OL,18,Fone day after targeting March 6 for
OL,19,FArtemis II, humanity's first flight to
OL,20,Fthe moon in more than half a century.

OL,6,FOvernight, the flow of helium to the
OL,7,Frocket's upper stage was interrupted,
OL,8,Fofficials said. Solid helium flow is
OL,9,Fessential for purging the engines and
OL,10,Fpressurizing the fuel tanks.
OL,12,FThis helium issue has nothing to do
OL,13,Fwith the hydrogen fuel leaks that
OL,14,Fmarred a countdown dress rehearsal of
