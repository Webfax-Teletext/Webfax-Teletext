OL,5,FIn this episode of Tonight, Paul Brand
OL,6,Finvestigates what is behind the record
OL,7,Flevels of shoplifting in the UK. The
OL,8,Fprogramme hears from a number of

OL,10,Fcrisis, who have been repeatedly
OL,11,Ftargeted by shoplifters. What is being
OL,12,Fdone to tackle the problem, and are
OL,13,Fconsumers ultimately paying the price?
OL,15,F"The retail industry is suffering from
OL,16,Fwhat appears to be an epidemic of
OL,17,Fshoplifting. We're seeing it more and
OL,18,Fmore every year, the stats are higher
