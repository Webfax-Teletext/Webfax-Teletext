OL,6,FIn a major U-turn, Sir Keir Starmer is
OL,7,Fset to backtrack on spending #28bn a
OL,8,Fyear on green projects, arguing it's
OL,9,Fnot possible due to the state of the
OL,10,Feconomy
OL,12,Fwants to make his general-election
OL,13,Fmanifesto bombproof, which is why he
OL,14,Fremoved that pledge to deploy #28
OL,15,Fbillion a year on green investments.

OL,6,FHis hope is this would neutralise
OL,7,Fcharge that Labour's investment plan
OL,8,Fwould lead to higher taxes or higher
OL,9,Finterest rates.JBut the question is
OL,10,Fwhether he is thereby turning that
OL,11,Fmanifesto into a dud, a blank, a great
OL,12,Ffat yawnathon, for a UK that is crying
OL,13,Fout for big ideas and hope.JThere are
OL,14,Fa few important and related points to
OL,15,Fmake about this significant U-turn.
OL,16,FThe first is that for any economically
OL,17,Fliterate person, the #28 billion was
OL,18,Fno longer the lethal weapon for the
OL,19,FTories that they wanted it to be -
OL,20,Fafter said on my programme (and every
OL,21,Ftime she opens her mouth, anywhere)
OL,22,Fthat it would only be spent if it
OL,23,Fdidn't risk breaching the fiscal rules
OL,24,F(namely that debt as a share of
OL,25,Fnational income must be falling on a
OL,26,Frolling timetable of five years).JThis

OL,6,FSo in that sense, the investment is no
OL,7,Fmore likely to increase inflation,
OL,8,Finterest rates or any other factor
OL,9,Faffecting our living standards than
OL,10,Fany spending or investment decision he
OL,11,Fmakes.JTo put it another way, the #28
OL,12,Fbillion had become, at the point that
OL,13,FReeves said the fiscal rules always
OL,14,Ftake precedent, simply a symbol of how
OL,15,FLabour's fiscal choices are different
OL,16,Ffrom those of the Tories.JThe #28
OL,17,Fbillion was a shorthand for "if there
OL,18,Fis money to invest, it will go on
OL,19,Finsulating homes, building giga
OL,20,Ffactories, connecting windfarms to the
OL,21,Fgrid and so on" and in the process
OL,22,Freduce household energy bills, create

OL,6,FStarmer will claim that Labour would
OL,7,Fstill prioritise more green investment
OL,8,Fthan the Tories. But his claims will
OL,9,Fsound less compelling, less exciting,
OL,10,Fless brave.JPerhaps what is most
OL,11,Fsurprising is that he has been
OL,12,Fallowing the government to set the
OL,13,Feconomic agenda - despite the Tories
OL,14,Fastonishing lack of popular support -
OL,15,Fby repeatedly saying he agrees the tax

OL,17,Fnot increase corporation tax, income
OL,18,Ftaxes and so on.JHe's defining Labour
OL,19,Fat the moment by what it would not do
OL,20,Fin government: he won't put up taxes,
OL,21,Fhe won't re-integrate the UK's economy
OL,22,Fwith that of the European Union (EU),
OL,23,Fhe won't restore the cap on bankers'

OL,8,Fdoesn't think they are universally
OL,9,Fpopular - such as giving more power to
