OL,8,Fmanufacturing center where exports to
OL,9,Fthe United States make up nearly 70%
OL,10,Fof their output
OL,12,FIt is in places like Dongguan in
OL,13,Fsouthern China where Donald Trump's
OL,14,Ftariffs are hitting the hardest.
OL,16,FThe city is a hub for tech and
OL,17,Findustrial manufacturing, and it is
OL,18,Fone of many cities in Guangdong
