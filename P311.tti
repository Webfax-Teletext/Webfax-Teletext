OL,6,FAn original issue of the Magna Carta,
OL,7,Fwhich auctioneers mistakenly
OL,8,Fcatalogued as a copy in the 1940s and
OL,9,Fsold for a "fairly derisory price",
OL,10,Fhas been identified.
OL,12,FResearchers have concluded that the
OL,13,Fdocument is far more valuable than
OL,14,Ffirst thought and is in fact a rare
OL,15,Fversion from 1300 issued by King
OL,16,FEdward I.
