OL,6,FAJ Bell has crunched the numbers for
OL,7,FITV News and has calculated that in
OL,8,Fbroad terms, higher-risk pensions are
OL,9,Fdown 5.9%, medium risk 3.8% and low
OL,10,F1.9%.
OL,12,FExperts say don't panic though.
OL,14,FMost people will have their pensions
OL,15,Fmoved to safer assets in the years
OL,16,Fbefore retirement, and younger people
OL,17,Fhave time to ride out the volatility.
OL,18,FThose losses were also down on Monday
OL,19,Fwhen by comparison a higher-risk
OL,20,Fpension was down around 8%.

OL,6,FSomething similar started happening in
OL,7,Fthe US in recent days. Spooked
OL,8,Finvestors started selling government
OL,9,Fbonds, which in turn acted to push up
OL,10,Finterest rates that the US government
OL,11,Fwould have to pay to borrow.
OL,13,FThere were serious concerns that this

OL,15,Fget out of control. That's why Trump
OL,16,Ffelt he had to act.
