OL,6,FSpeaking about the importance of the

OL,8,FEcology Dr Kelly Hemmings, said: "Our

OL,11,Fus to piece together patterns of
OL,12,Fbiodiversity change over the last two

OL,15,FShe continued: "The research
OL,16,Fpossibilities are endless - branching
OL,17,Fout into climate change, habitat
OL,18,Fmanagement, genetics, and so much
OL,19,Fmore."
