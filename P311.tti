OL,6,FForecaster Simon Partridge said: "It
OL,7,Fdoes look like we will have the
OL,8,Fcoldest night of this winter so far,
OL,9,Fwidely areas are below freezing.
OL,11,F"And the main reason for that is we've
OL,12,Fgot a little ridge of high pressure
OL,13,Fmoving across the UK overnight tonight
OL,14,Fand basically the main difference
OL,15,Fbetween that and previous nights is
OL,16,Fthe winds are a lot lighter."
OL,18,FMr Partridge said that much of the
OL,19,Fcountry will see frost in the morning
OL,20,Fbut that later in the day there is
OL,21,Fexpected to be widespread sunshine.
