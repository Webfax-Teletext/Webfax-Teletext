OL,3,CSir Ian McKellen: Fat suit saved me
OL,4,Cfrom worse injuries after West End fall
OL,6,FSir Ian McKellen has revealed that a
OL,7,Ffat suit "saved" his "ribs and other
OL,8,Fjoints" during a fall from a stage in
OL,9,Fthe West End but said he was "nervous"
OL,10,Fto leave his house after the accident.
OL,12,FThe veteran screen and stage actor,
OL,13,F85, lost his footing during a Player
OL,14,FKings fight scene in June when the
OL,15,Fproduction was at the Noel Coward
OL,16,FTheatre and has since been suffering
OL,17,Ffrom wrist and neck injuries.
OL,19,FSpeaking to Saga magazine, he said:
OL,20,F"I've relived that fall I don't know
OL,21,Fhow many times. It was horrible.

OL,8,Fshake it off I started to slide on
OL,9,Fsome newspaper that was scattered over

OL,12,F"The more I tried to get rid of it,

OL,6,F"The end", he clarifies, did not mean
OL,7,F"my death. It was my participation in
OL,8,Fthe play. I have to keep assuring
OL,9,Fmyself that I'm not too old to act and
OL,10,Fit was just a bloody accident.
OL,12,F"I didn't lose consciousness, I hadn't

OL,14,Fgo back and they still played without
OL,15,Fme.
OL,17,F"I don't feel guilty, but the accident
OL,18,Fhas let down the whole production," he
OL,19,Fsaid.
