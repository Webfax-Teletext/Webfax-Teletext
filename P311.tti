OL,6,FMany are furious it's taken so long,
OL,7,Fbut this is a moment of history -
OL,8,Fhistoric and momentous.
OL,10,FThe ceasefire deal between Hamas and
OL,11,FIsrael is most historic thing that's
OL,12,Fhappened since Iran attacked Israel
OL,13,Ffor the first time ever, by sending
OL,14,Fhundreds of missiles and drones this
OL,15,Fway last April.
OL,17,FI mention that attack because it was a
OL,18,Fdirect result of the war in Gaza, and
OL,19,Fit proved just how inflammatory the
OL,20,Fconflict could become.

OL,3,CAn 'historic' ceasefire, but
OL,4,Cvolatility lies ahead
OL,6,FWe often talk about the potential for
OL,7,FMiddle East conflicts to spread and
OL,8,Fthe Gaza war proved itself to be
OL,9,Fdangerously contagious.
OL,11,FIt sparked those tit-for-tat exchanges
OL,12,Fwith the Iranians; it sparked a war in
OL,13,FLebanon and it prompted the Houthis of
OL,14,FYemen to attack Israel for the first
OL,15,Ftime.
OL,17,FIt could also be argued that the war
OL,18,Fin Gaza indirectly led to the fall of
OL,19,FAssad in Syria, so it had enormous
OL,20,Fconsequences for this region.

OL,6,FIf this ceasefire lasts, it will take
OL,7,Fa lot of heat out of this troubled
OL,8,Fregion.
OL,10,FHowever, I fear the chances of things
OL,11,Fworking out are no better than 50 to
OL,12,F50.
OL,14,FThat's because, for several weeks
OL,15,Fduring the first phase, a lot of
OL,16,FIsraeli soldiers will remain in the
OL,17,FGaza Strip cheek by jowl with Hamas
OL,18,Fand the potential for volatility, for
OL,19,Fexchanges to flare up, is obvious.
