OL,7,FResearchers have developed the first-

OL,9,Fmyalgic encephalomyelitis, also known
OL,10,Fas chronic fatigue syndrome.
OL,12,FThere is no current test for the
OL,13,Fcondition, which is characterised by
OL,14,Fsufferers struggling with extreme
OL,15,Ftiredness. It is also known as ME or
OL,16,FCFS, and its exact cause is unknown.
