OL,4,CNHS and social care
OL,6,FThe leader of the Liberal Democrats,
OL,7,FSir Ed Davey, has promised to scrap a
OL,8,FUK-US pharmaceutical deal in an effort
OL,9,Fto eliminate NHS waiting lists and
OL,10,Fimprove the ongoing "corridor-care"
OL,11,Fcrisis.
OL,13,FDavey claimed scrapping the deal would
OL,14,Fsee the UK retain upwards of #3
OL,15,Fbillion, which could then be used to
OL,16,Ffund social care, with a view to
OL,17,Falleviating pressure in A&E.
