OL,8,Fmay have left you wondering how common
OL,9,Fseismic events are in the UK.
OL,11,FThe tremor struck shortly after

OL,13,Fand the southern Lake District,
OL,14,Fincluding the towns of Kendal and
OL,15,FUlverston, within 12 miles of the
OL,16,Fepicentre.
OL,18,FData suggests the quake occurred just

OL,20,FLancashire, at a depth of 1.86 miles.
