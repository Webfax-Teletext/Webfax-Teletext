OL,6,FSince becoming Labour's leader in the
OL,7,Fspring of 2020, Sir Keir Starmer has
OL,8,Fbeen focused, ruthless and lucky.
OL,10,FHe purged antisemitism, shifted Labour
OL,11,Fto a more electorally credible
OL,12,Fcentrist position by marginalising the
OL,13,Fleft of the party - which included the
OL,14,Fsymbolic expulsion of his predecessor
OL,15,FJeremy Corbyn - and revelled in the
OL,16,FTory government's splits, incompetence
OL,17,Fand ethical failures.
