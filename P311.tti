OL,6,FKeir Starmer has set himself quite the
OL,7,Fchallenge at this the most important
OL,8,FLabour conference of his political
OL,9,Fcareer, a conference that is all about
OL,10,Fconvincing his party that he is still
OL,11,Fa winner.
OL,13,FHe is turning on Farage and Reform
OL,14,Fwith a new found passion and
OL,15,Fcharacterising its anti-immigration
OL,16,Fpolicies as immoral and racist, while
OL,17,Ftrying nonetheless to build bridges
OL,18,Fwith Reform's supporters.

OL,6,FThen he morphed to saying immigration

OL,9,Fpractice they were seen as a "lite"

OL,13,FStarmer and his centrist colleagues
OL,14,Fwere heard as endorsing the populists
OL,15,Fand they therefore reinforced the
