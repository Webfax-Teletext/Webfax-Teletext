OL,7,F"For example, there is going to be a
OL,8,Fbig focus on childcare. Although, to
OL,9,Fbe fair to the Conservatives, they had
OL,10,Ftaken us quite a long way on that
OL,11,Fchildcare journey - but I know that's
OL,12,Fsomething that Reeves really cares
OL,13,Fabout. Her experience definitely
OL,14,Finfluences how she behaves and what
OL,15,Fshe cares about, which is why the
OL,16,Fbreakfast policy, childcare and the
OL,17,Fgender pay gap are so important to
OL,18,Fher. It was not a small decision to
OL,19,Fsign up to a #4 billion childcare

OL,21,Finactivity and mothers in work.
