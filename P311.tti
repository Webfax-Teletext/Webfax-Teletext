OL,7,Fshown on ITV on Thursday, December 18,
OL,8,FBackshall also completed a dive under
OL,9,Fthe sea ice, just as the 26-year-old
OL,10,Fprince did 50 years earlier.
OL,12,FAs they watched the footage of a young
OL,13,FCharles in a big red diving suit from
OL,14,F1975, the King joked: "Thank God I was
OL,15,Fyounger in those days. I could never
OL,16,Fhave survived now!"
OL,18,FThe two men were discussing exploring
OL,19,Fhow much has changed in the region as
OL,20,Fa result of changes in climate and
OL,21,Fwarming seas.

OL,13,F"If it carries on like this,"
