OL,7,Fbeing cared for by costumed keepers
OL,8,Fand a giant stuffed teddy bear, to

OL,13,Falone in Southern California's Los

OL,16,FBiologists hoped that the baby's
OL,17,Fmother would return, but she didn't,
OL,18,Fand the cub could not fend for himself.

OL,6,FA giant stuffed teddy bear, nicknamed

OL,8,Fthe cubs enclosure. The cub can be

OL,11,Fteddy bear for a nap.
OL,13,FThe tactics have been working, with

OL,6,FThe hope is that the cub will be able

OL,9,Frequire such as finding food, seeking

OL,12,FThe youngster has recently learned to
