OL,7,FYoung people in England are studying a
OL,8,F"narrower range" of subjects in post-
OL,9,F16 education than two decades ago, a
OL,10,Freport has suggested.
OL,12,FStudents are increasingly choosing all
OL,13,Fof their A-levels from a single
OL,14,Fsubject group, according to the
OL,15,FNational Foundation for Educational
OL,16,FResearch (NFER).
OL,18,FThe findings have been published as
OL,19,Fstudents across England, Wales and
OL,20,FNorthern Ireland are due to receive
OL,21,Ftheir A-level results on Thursday.
