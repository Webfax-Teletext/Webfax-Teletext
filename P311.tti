OL,3,CStorm Goretti: Have we seen the worst
OL,4,Cof it?
OL,6,FStorm Goretti has delivered a spell of
OL,7,Fnotably disruptive weather across the
OL,8,FUK over the past 24 hours, bringing
OL,9,Fdamaging winds, heavy snow, and
OL,10,Fwidespread disruption to transport and
OL,11,Fpower supplies.
OL,13,FHowever, conditions will gradually
OL,14,Fease throughout the day, although
OL,15,Ffurther spells of rain and gusty winds
OL,16,Fwill continue to affect eastern areas
OL,17,Fbefore the storm fully clears tomorrow.
OL,19,FFor many, Saturday should bring a
OL,20,Fcalmer interlude, as the UK briefly
OL,21,Fsits between weather systems.

OL,6,FHowever, this quieter spell is
OL,7,Fexpected to be short-lived, with
OL,8,Fanother area of low pressure moving in
OL,9,Flater on Saturday and into Sunday.
OL,11,FA yellow weather warning for snow and
OL,12,Fice is in place for Scotland, the
OL,13,FNortheast and Yorkshire on Saturday.
OL,15,FYellow ice warnings are also in place
OL,16,Ffor most parts of Wales, the West

OL,18,FEngland and the south coast.

OL,6,FAt this stage, the next system is not
OL,7,Fexpected to be named and is forecast
OL,8,Fto be less intense than Storm Goretti.
OL,10,FNevertheless, some disruption remains
OL,11,Fpossible. Rain will push eastwards
OL,12,Fand, as it meets colder air, could
OL,13,Ffall as snow, particularly across
OL,14,FScotland and parts of northern England.
OL,16,FSome parts of the UK on higher ground
OL,17,Fcould see 10-20cm of snow.

OL,13,FAs the system clears, milder air will

OL,16,FCombined with additional rainfall,
OL,17,Fthis raises the risk of localised
