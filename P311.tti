OL,6,FIn a nutshell, the stark temperature
OL,7,Fcontrast north to south across the USA
OL,8,Fsupercharges the jet stream, which has
OL,9,Fthe effect of 'bigger weather' here in

OL,11,Fthan it would otherwise be.
OL,13,FAnd this will be the case while the

OL,15,Falthough there will be spells of
OL,16,Fbrighter, drier weather (most likely
