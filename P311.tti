OL,7,Fwill present the Peston show on
OL,8,FWednesday night.
OL,10,FWe're here because this presidential
OL,11,Felection may be the most important
OL,12,Fpolitical event in all our lives for
OL,13,Fat least a generation.
OL,15,FThe reasons it is so consequential are
OL,16,Fglobal and narrowly British.

OL,9,Fare wars in Ukraine and the Middle
OL,10,FEast, growing superpower tension
OL,11,Fbetween China and the US, and the

OL,14,FTo simplify: Kamala Harris represents
OL,15,Fcontinuity America; Trump says (though
OL,16,Fwe've learned that for him words are
OL,17,Fnot always deeds) that he wants a
OL,18,Fmassive increase in tariffs, that he
OL,19,Fwould expel millions of undocumented
OL,20,Fimmigrants, and that he would end the
OL,21,FUkraine war pronto.
