OL,7,FThe mainstream parties shunned this
OL,8,Fcampaign. Labour ditched their early
OL,9,Fon. As did the Green Party. The
OL,10,FConservatives barely campaigned and
OL,11,Fthe Liberal Democrats had very little
OL,12,Fpresence. As a result, it's difficult
OL,13,Fto read too much into the results and

OL,16,FBut the chaotic - and at times
