OL,6,FGovernor of the Bank of England,
OL,7,FAndrew Bailey, said: "We've passed the

OL,9,Fcontinued to fall, so we have cut

OL,11,F3.75%, today. We still think rates are
OL,12,Fon a gradual path downward. But with
OL,13,Fevery cut we make, how much further we
OL,14,Fgo becomes a closer call."
OL,16,FSince August last year, interest rates
OL,17,Fhave fallen at their fastest pace
OL,18,Fsince the 2008 financial crisis.
