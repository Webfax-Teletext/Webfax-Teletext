OL,15,FOne of its most important pieces of

OL,9,Fwhat is in her Budget.
OL,11,FBut this year, it - and as a result,
OL,12,Fthe contents of the chancellor's
OL,13,Fspeech - was available before Rachel
OL,14,FReeves even stepped up to the dispatch
OL,15,Fbox to deliver her speech in the House
OL,16,Fof Commons.
