OL,6,FHome Secretary Yvette Cooper has
OL,7,Flabelled Palestine Action more than "a
OL,8,Fregular protest group" as she defended
OL,9,Fthe group's proscription as a
OL,10,Fterrorist organisation.
OL,12,FShe said protest and free speech
OL,13,Fremain "an important part of our
OL,14,Fdemocracy" which will "always be
OL,15,Fprotected", but argued Palestine
OL,16,FAction has carried out "an escalating
OL,17,Fcampaign".

OL,7,F"Some may think it is a regular

OL,6,F"Protecting public safety and national

OL,19,F"That is why the proscription of this
