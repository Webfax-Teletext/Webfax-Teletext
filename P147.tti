OL,6,GIt really is time for ITV to take a
OL,7,Gproper look at the remnants of UTV
OL,8,Gchannel branding.
OL,10,FIt's now three years since network
OL,11,Ftrails and continuity were introduced
OL,12,F` a pandemic measure which became
OL,13,Fpermanent.
OL,15,FThen last November ITV 1 branding was
OL,16,Fintroduced on local trails as part of
OL,17,Fa national revamp. Or at least ITV 1
OL,18,Fvisual branding was introduced. The
OL,19,Fvoice-overs still refer to local
OL,20,Fprogrammes as being "on UTV".

OL,6,FIt goes against one of the most basic
OL,7,Frules of branding and marketing `
OL,8,Ftake one brand name and go big with
OL,9,Fit.
OL,11,FThis last remnant of UTV as a channel
OL,12,Fname is confusing and needs to be put
OL,13,Fto rest.
OL,15,FDoes anyone at ITV honestly think
OL,16,Fthere will be protests? I tend to
OL,17,Fthink this is down to lethargy, undue
OL,18,Fcaution or indifference rather than a
OL,19,Fpositive decision to hold on to the
OL,20,Fname.

OL,6,FThe same goes for the channel name on
OL,7,Fthe EPG. It should be updated to ITV
OL,8,F1 or ITV 1 ` UTV.
OL,10,FOtherwise it's simply confusing and
OL,11,Fcontradictory. Sky and Freesat
OL,12,Fviewers do not, by the way, receive
OL,13,FUTV + 1 but get ITV 1 + 1 after a
OL,14,Fround of rationalisation. Again this

OL,6,FI'm totally relaxed about holding on
OL,7,Fto the UTV name within programmes
OL,8,Funder the ITV and ITV 1 masterbrands.
OL,9,FIt's no more foolish than holding on
OL,10,Fto the legacies of Meridian and
OL,11,FGranada.
OL,13,FI'm still sure explicit ITV News
OL,14,Fbranding to match other regions is
OL,15,Fonly a matter of time. Similarly a
OL,16,FUTV hallmark on other local
OL,17,Fprogrammes is no bad thing.
OL,19,FBut the name of the channel itself is
OL,20,Fnow very clearly ITV 1.
