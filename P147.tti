OL,6,GRemember the good old days of the

OL,8,Gfor millions. Maybe a trip to the

OL,11,FThese days bank holidays are very
OL,12,Fdifferent.
OL,14,FWhile some companies still give their
OL,15,Fstaff the day off, many businesses
OL,16,Fopen as usual. On a typical high

OL,6,FThat is, of course, if you still have

OL,9,Fclosed, causing very real worries for
OL,10,Fthose who prefer traditional banking
OL,11,Fand those with broader concerns about

OL,14,FSome bank holidays are not observed in
