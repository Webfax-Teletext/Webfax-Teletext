OL,16,FIt is possible they will reject STV's

OL,6,FRealistically they'll either say yes
OL,7,For broker some compromise. Perhaps pre-
OL,8,Frecorded localised bulletins at 1.55pm
OL,9,Fand 10.30pm plus a pre-recorded sub-
OL,10,Fopt within the 6pm programme. (At the
OL,11,Fweekend both regions get a joint
OL,12,Fbulletin from Glasgow.)
OL,14,FBut I cannot see Ofcom insisting that
OL,15,Fany remaining programme for the north
OL,16,Fneeds to be presented from Aberdeen.
OL,18,FThey cannot be inconsistent with what

OL,21,FWestcountry from Bristol, the East
OL,22,FMidlands from Birmingham.

OL,10,FSTV North does show some Scottish

OL,15,FBut a 10-minute recorded section

OL,18,Fmight be undesirable. Big stories or
