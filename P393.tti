OL,6,FWhen she first joined the school as a
OL,7,Fsupply teacher in January 2019, her
OL,8,Fpartner was already in prison. The
OL,9,Fpanel was told that although the 12-
OL,10,Fyear relationship hadn't formally
OL,11,Fended, Till was "distancing herself"
OL,12,Fafter his 2018 conviction.
OL,14,FShe eventually ended the relationship
OL,15,Fin August 2020, describing it as
OL,16,F"controlling and difficult".
OL,18,FAsked if Person A posed a risk to
OL,19,Fchildren, Till responded: "Probably,
OL,20,Fif he was in a position with children
OL,21,Falone."

OL,10,Frelationship)."
OL,12,FThe panel said there may not have been

OL,14,Fbut described her silence as a
OL,15,F"serious omission" and a failure in

OL,18,FIt was also suggested that her former
