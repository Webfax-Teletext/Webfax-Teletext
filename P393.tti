OL,7,FCoastal erosion has left one man's
OL,8,Fproperty on a cliff edge on the Isle
OL,9,Fof Man.
OL,11,FIt is an issue that has been affecting
OL,12,Fthe northern coast of the island for
OL,13,Fthousands of years, with climate
OL,14,Fchange accelerating the problem.
OL,16,FChris Kelly bought land on the side of
OL,17,Fthe cliff 13 years ago, and since then
OL,18,Fhe has watch it is disappear beneath
OL,19,Fhis feet - a problem he says is
OL,20,Fsolvable.

OL,20,Fwould then protect an investment in a

OL,7,FWhile the Isle of Man Government say

OL,9,Fthe minister for infrastructure

OL,13,FDr Michelle Haywood, said: "At the

OL,16,Fthat we put in there, once the sea

OL,20,Fcreates swirls, and it will wash
