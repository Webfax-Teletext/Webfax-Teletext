OL,6,FKay Headford is haunted by what she
OL,7,Fwitnessed on her early morning walk
OL,8,Fdown a towpath. A deer was struggling
OL,9,Fin the Bridgewater Canal. Despite her
OL,10,Fbest efforts to save it, the animal
OL,11,Fdrowned in front of her.
OL,13,F"It was an awful spectacle - the
OL,14,Fdeer's distress, and the awful noises
OL,15,Fit was making as it tried to stay
OL,16,Fafloat." she said. "It was
OL,17,Fheartbreaking."

OL,6,FSadly, the incident is a regular
OL,7,Foccurrence. Kay said "I go walking my
OL,8,Fdogs at 4.30am every day before going
OL,9,Fto work. I am seeing deer stranded in
OL,10,Fthe canal several times a week. They
OL,11,Fare alive and trying to get out.
OL,13,F"On one occasion I stripped down to my
OL,14,Fpants and bra and got in the water to
OL,15,Ftry and rescue one deer, but could not
OL,16,Freach it. Somebody had to pull me out

OL,6,FThe 42-year-old was galvanised to act
OL,7,Fafter seeing stricken deer in the

OL,14,F"The area in which I have seen the

OL,6,FKay is campaigning for a scheme
OL,7,Fsimilar to one in Doncaster where
OL,8,Framps were installed in 2020 after
OL,9,Fdeer were getting into difficulty in
OL,10,Fthe Stainforth and Keadby Canal.
OL,11,FMounds of stone were used on the edge
OL,12,Fof the canal to allow animals to climb
OL,13,Fout and on to the bank. That
OL,14,Finitiative was back by former Labour
OL,15,Fleader and local MP, Ed Milliband.
OL,17,FUnlike that canal, which is managed by
OL,18,Fthe Canal and River Trust, the
OL,19,FBridgewater Canal is owned by private
OL,20,Fcompany Peel Group.

OL,8,FWildlife matters and I think the
