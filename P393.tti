OL,7,FThe RSPCA Stapeley Grange Wildlife
OL,8,FCentre in Cheshire say they're trying
OL,9,Fto dispel old superstitions about
OL,10,Fblack cats to rehome animals in their
OL,11,Fcare.
OL,13,FThe charity says that black, and black
OL,14,Fand white cats, are far more difficult
OL,15,Fto find new homes for in part due to
OL,16,Ftheir 'spooky' reputation and that
OL,17,Fthey are nearly three times more
OL,18,Flikely to come into care than tabby
OL,19,Ffelines, and that they take three
OL,20,Ftimes longer to find homes than tabby
OL,21,Fcats.

OL,8,Fexpert, said: "There are

OL,10,Fand white cats in our care than any
OL,11,Fother coat colour - and they also take
OL,12,Fmuch longer to rehome, which sadly
OL,13,Fmeans they are staying in rescue

OL,15,Fonly is this sad for the cats who are
OL,16,Fpatiently waiting for their second

OL,18,Fthat there are limited spaces to help

OL,20,Fof black cats which sadly no one wants
