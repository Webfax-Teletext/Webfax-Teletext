OL,6,FAs the Golden Lion was the only pub in
OL,7,Fthe village, campaigners received a
OL,8,Fgovernment grant from the Levelling Up
OL,9,Ffund - but still needed to raise
OL,10,Falmost #400,000.
OL,12,FThey then used an initiative where
OL,13,Fpeople could buy shares in the pub,
OL,14,Fwith the landlord agreeing to sell.
OL,16,FAfter purchasing and fully
OL,17,Frefurbishing the premises, the
OL,18,Fcommunity group behind the project has
OL,19,Fbeen enjoying the first pints pulled
OL,20,Fthere in more than a decade, after a
OL,21,Fspecial red-ribbon opening.
