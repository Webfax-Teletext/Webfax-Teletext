OL,6,FJulie, from Crosby, says she was told
OL,7,Fthere were hundreds of patients in A&E
OL,8,Fwhen she arrived, but she was
OL,9,Finitially seen really quickly and she
OL,10,F"couldn't fault" the staff.
OL,12,F"They were so busy. They had no beds,"
OL,13,Fshe said. "They were putting patients
OL,14,Fonto wards, onto corridors on every
OL,15,Fward on every floor so they can keep

OL,20,FA&E which was pretty horrendous.
