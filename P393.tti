OL,6,FWhat is choriocarcinoma?
OL,8,FChoriocarcinoma is a rare, fast-
OL,9,Fgrowing, and aggressive cancer that
OL,10,Fcan occur in the uterus, ovaries, or
OL,11,Ftestes. It's a type of gestational
OL,12,Ftrophoblastic disease that can develop
OL,13,Fafter a pregnancy.
OL,15,FIt is more common after a molar
OL,16,Fpregnancy but can also happen after a
OL,17,Ffull term pregnancy, miscarriage,
OL,18,Fectopic pregnancy or abortion,
OL,19,Faccording to Cancer Research.

OL,6,FChoriocarcinoma only happens in about
OL,7,F1 in every 50,000 pregnancies and can
OL,8,Fdevelop some months or even years
OL,9,Fafter pregnancy. It can be difficult
OL,10,Fto diagnose because it is so rare.
OL,12,FIt can spread to other parts of the
OL,13,Fbody, but is usually cured by
OL,14,Fchemotherapy treatment or surgery.
OL,16,FBecause Victoria has undergone four
OL,17,Frounds of immunotherapy treatment, she
OL,18,Fis not eligible for a fifth round of
OL,19,Fimmunotherapy on the NHS, sparking her
OL,20,Ffamily's decision to raise money for
OL,21,Fpotentially lifesaving treatment.
