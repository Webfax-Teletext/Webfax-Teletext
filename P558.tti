OL,5,
OL,6,FA couple of weeks ago I reflected on
OL,7,Fwhether the last parts of UTV's
OL,8,Fdistinct visual identity may disappear
OL,9,Fby stealth.
OL,11,FUTV's main news programmes and weather
OL,12,Fdo not carry explicit ITV branding
OL,13,Falthough in every other respect they
OL,14,Flook identical to the news and weather
OL,15,Fin other regions.
OL,17,FThen, sure enough, another change by
OL,18,Fstealth happened.

OL,8,Finstance on the regional pages on

OL,11,FThe change itself is no big deal. It
OL,12,Fwas simply time to freshen up the
OL,13,Fimages. Perhaps presenters have changed
OL,14,Fin some areas or, dare I say it, some
OL,15,Fmay now look a little older.
OL,17,FBut in UTV land the innocuous change is

OL,11,FIt is worth noting too that the online
