OL,6,FParents whose children attend a

OL,8,Fare "heartbroken" at its proposed
OL,9,Fclosure.
OL,11,FBradbury House at the Royal School for
OL,12,Fthe Blind in Wavertree provides
OL,13,Fresidential stays for children with
OL,14,Fcomplex needs.
OL,16,FBut from next Summer, the school says
OL,17,Fit will no longer offer respite stays
OL,18,Fbecause of funding pressures.

OL,6,FThe proposed closure comes just weeks
OL,7,Fafter children's hospice Zoe's Place
OL,8,Fwas saved.
OL,10,FSeveral mums have said they are
OL,11,Fdevastated and their children have
OL,12,Fnowhere else to go, including Alison
OL,13,FMooney and her son Alex, who has
OL,14,Fcerebral palsy.
OL,16,FAlison said: "It is genuinely
OL,17,Fheartbreaking. It's been a home away
OL,18,Ffrom home for Alex when he has needed
OL,19,Fit the most."
