OL,6,FThe under-11s boys side, from
OL,7,FMorecambe, had yet to notch up a win
OL,8,Fin their entire existence. But a
OL,9,Fthumping scoreline of 6-0 on Sunday,
OL,10,F14 April, saw the heroic bunch of lads
OL,11,Fshake up the form book in style.
OL,13,FAnd with top performances from the
OL,14,Fwhole squad, manager Sophia
OL,15,FKolodziejska was elated. Victory
OL,16,Ftasted sweet.

OL,20,FSophia told LancsLive. Her pride for
OL,21,Fher team was tangible.
