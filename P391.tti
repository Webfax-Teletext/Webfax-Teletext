OL,6,FAt the end of a four-day jury inquest
OL,7,Fon Friday 4 April, the jury ruled that
OL,8,FHailey died of natural causes, but
OL,9,Fthat there was a 'missed opportunity'
OL,10,Fto review Hailey's care at 'primary
OL,11,Fcare level'.
OL,13,FCoroner Michael Pemberton has written
OL,14,Fto SSP Health, which runs Ashton
OL,15,FMedical Centre where Hailey was a
OL,16,Fpatient, to say there is a 'risk that
OL,17,Ffuture deaths could occur unless
