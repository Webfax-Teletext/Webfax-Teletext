OL,9,Fwas a remarkable man. It would be easy
OL,10,Fto say he was one of life's characters
OL,11,Fbut he was a product of what he'd
OL,12,Flived through at an impressionable age
OL,13,Fand it forged him into the unique
OL,14,Fperson he was - indefatigable! We are
OL,15,Fall proud to have known him."

OL,6,FHis friend Terry Cook said: "I visited
OL,7,FErnest just a few days before he
OL,8,Fpassed away and he was in good
OL,9,Fspirits, although he knew his time was
OL,10,Fcoming to an end. He was a remarkable
OL,11,Findividual and we understand he was
OL,12,Fthe oldest surviving male veteran from
OL,13,Fthat generation. He's had a wonderful
OL,14,Flife, an amazing career and remarkable
OL,15,Flongevity. It is a very sad occasion,
OL,16,Fof course, but also an opportunity to
OL,17,Fcelebrate a very special individual."
