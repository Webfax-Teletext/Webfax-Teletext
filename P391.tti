OL,6,FWhat began as a "massive adventure",
OL,7,Fhe says, quickly turned into a five-
OL,8,Fyear campaign of sexual abuse by the
OL,9,Fclub's owner, Patrick Lowe.
OL,11,F"When I started, it was a massive

OL,14,F"Some older friends who my dad had
OL,15,Fstarted boxing with years earlier went
OL,16,Fto the club, and it was exciting to be

OL,19,F"But one night out of the blue, I was

OL,21,Fwhen it first started.

OL,10,FIt was only then, after 30 years of
