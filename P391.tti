OL,7,FResidents living close to a pub say
OL,8,Fits large outdoor teepee has turned
OL,9,Ftheir lives into a 'nightmare'.
OL,11,FAimee Burgess, who lives opposite the
OL,12,Fpub in Ramsbottom, claims the
OL,13,F'constant noise' of people doing
OL,14,Fkaraoke outside the pub at 1am woke
OL,15,Fher up.
OL,17,FShe said: "It's ridiculous... it's
OL,18,Flike having a festival outside the
OL,19,Fhouse with the amount of music, people
OL,20,Fwooing and cheering, and bottles
OL,21,Fsmashing. It's constant."
