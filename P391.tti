OL,6,FChief Constable Mark Roberts, said:
OL,7,F"While the nature of policing
OL,8,Finevitably requires officers to deal
OL,9,Fwith violent and challenging
OL,10,Fsituations, that does not mean that
OL,11,Four officers can be used as punchbags.
OL,13,F"Nobody should have to come to work
OL,14,Fand expect that they will be verbally
OL,15,For physically assaulted.
OL,17,F"Sadly, over the last weekend alone
OL,18,Fwe've seen ten police officers and
OL,19,FPCSOs assaulted while simply trying to
OL,20,Fdo their job, and unfortunately this
OL,21,Ffigure is not unusual.
