OL,6,FBut, refusing the let the heart of the
OL,7,Fvillage disappear, residents and
OL,8,Fformer regulars joined forces to buy
OL,9,Fshares in the pub, and began raising
OL,10,Fmoney.
OL,12,FAfter a decade the community is now
OL,13,Fproudly the owner of the pub once

OL,17,F"We've had 11 years of trials and

OL,19,Fhere," said Hugo Deymen, chairman of
OL,20,Fthe community benefit society that
OL,21,Fbought the pub.

OL,13,FAs the Golden Lion was the only pub in
