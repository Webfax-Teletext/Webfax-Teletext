OL,7,FHome Office pathologist Dr Richard
OL,8,FShepherd told the inquest: "There were
OL,9,Fextensive changes due to
OL,10,Fdecomposition. There were changes due
OL,11,Fto the period of time he was lying in
OL,12,Fa hot environment - changes I would
OL,13,Fexpect to see in that period of 28

OL,16,FThe pathologist says Jay suffered
OL,17,Fseveral injuries but "that to the head
OL,18,Fis by far the most important one in
OL,19,Funderstanding why Jay died".

OL,7,FDr Shepherd explained that this

OL,9,Fconsiderable force", adding: "The
OL,10,Fpattern of injuries is entirely
OL,11,Fconsistent with a heavy fall from
OL,12,Fheight."
OL,14,FThe head injury which Jay suffered
OL,15,F"would have had an immediate and
OL,16,Fdevastating effect", Dr Shepherd says.
OL,17,F"The injury is so severe that I have

OL,19,Fbeen rendered immediately unconscious."
