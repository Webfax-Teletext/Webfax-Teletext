OL,6,F"It saved my life" and "I wouldn't be

OL,8,Fof domestic abuse who say a charity
OL,9,Fhelped them rebuild their lives.
OL,11,FMy Cheshire Without Abuse or My CWA
OL,12,Fhas been helping families fleeing
OL,13,Fdomestic violence for nearly 50 years.
OL,14,FBut it's facing an uncertain future
OL,15,Fafter council funding cuts.
OL,17,FMy CWA is the only independent
OL,18,Fdomestic abuse charity in the Cheshire
OL,19,FEast area, but it needs to raise half
OL,20,F#500,000 to keep its services like its
OL,21,F24/7 emergency helpline, going.
