OL,5,GWhat happens when two brands which are
OL,6,Gcompletely unconnected share a similar
OL,7,Gname and logo?
OL,9,FIt's rare but there are examples: in
OL,10,FScotland take a look at Bank of
OL,11,FScotland and Royal Bank of Scotland.
OL,13,FTheir logos are not dissimilar and on
OL,14,Foccasion they have been confused by
OL,15,Fcareless journalists and people moving
OL,16,Fto Scotland.
OL,18,FAs of today, there are two unconnected
OL,19,FTV networks which use the letter "U".

OL,5,FIt is the new masterbrand for UKTV's
OL,6,Ffree-to-air channels. And it is the
OL,7,Fname of the ITV region covering
OL,8,FNorthern Ireland.
OL,10,FIt is highly unlikely that UKTV or the
OL,11,Fbranding team which came up with the
OL,12,Fidentity were too concerned about the
OL,13,Fsituation in Northern Ireland.
OL,15,FThe legacies of the old UTV brand
OL,16,Fstill linger: the logo is seen on the
OL,17,Fnews programme UTV Live, the weather,
OL,18,Flocal trails and the magazine show UTV
OL,19,FLife. It also appears in the title
OL,20,Fsequences of many local programmes.

OL,3,CBrand similarity: UTV and U
OL,5,FI have argued before that there is no
OL,6,Fharm in keeping UTV as a local sub-
OL,7,Fbrand. It is no "worse" than the
OL,8,Fremaining use of Granada or Meridian.
OL,10,FBut it is time to ditch some of the
OL,11,Fremaining visual uses of the name.
OL,12,FOtherwise there could be a false
OL,13,Fassociation between UTV and the UKTV
OL,14,Fchannels. If you don't live in design
OL,15,Fworld, you might even think the U
OL,16,Flogos are similar although they are
OL,17,Fquite distinct.
OL,19,FThe EPG name needs to become iTV 1 or
OL,20,FITV 1 ` UTV.
