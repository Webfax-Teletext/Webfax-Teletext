OL,12,Ffor linear advertising.
OL,14,FBut last week was a bleak week for
OL,15,Finvestors in the Scottish broadcaster

OL,13,FSTV, of course, provides the Channel 3

OL,3,CSTV is vulnerable: but is anyone

OL,6,FSTV was never taken over by one of the
OL,7,F"big boys" during C3's consolidation
OL,8,Fin the nineties and noughties. Instead
OL,9,Fit grew as a company, buying Grampian,
OL,10,FVirgin Radio and Scottish newspapers.
OL,12,FThe company later came close to
OL,13,Fcollapse because of debt so sold most
OL,14,Fof the assets unconnected to the core
OL,15,FTV business.
OL,17,FPolitically, the possibility of
OL,18,FScottish independence in 2014 might
OL,19,Fhave deterred ITV from mounting a
OL,20,Ftakeover back then. Independence is
OL,21,Fnow highly unlikely in the foreseeable

OL,13,FThere is, however, no suggestion that

OL,16,FThe chief executive of any company has
