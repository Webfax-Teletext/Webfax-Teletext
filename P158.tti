OL,10,Fbroadcast on weeknights on BBC Two.
OL,11,F The BBC News at One will move to

OL,14,F Meanwhile, BBC Breakfast will be
OL,15,Fextended by 15 minutes ` that's less
OL,16,Fthan the 45-minute extension to 10am
OL,17,Fthat had once been mooted.
OL,18,F Over on the BBC's News Channel,

OL,21,Fwith more weekend airtime to be filled
OL,22,Fwith something else.

OL,6,FThe BBC says it will reinvest some
OL,7,Fmoney into online services, such as
OL,8,Flive blogs and streaming via the
OL,9,FiPlayer. In addition to helping the
OL,10,FBBC save #500 million, BBC News says
OL,11,Fit is responding to a fall in linear
OL,12,Faudiences, which it says has fallen
OL,13,F11% in the last five years.
OL,15,FHowever, it's known that news
OL,16,Faudiences actually rose in 2020 and
OL,17,F2021 due to the pandemic, so the drop
OL,18,Fquoted may be exaggerated by events
OL,19,Fthat took place in recent years.

OL,12,Fhow the BBC News Channel had lost 1

OL,15,FA fall in audiences can thus be used

OL,6,FThat a shift online does not

OL,9,Fgrowth of streaming-only news

OL,11,FUS channels originally designed as an
OL,12,Fonline-only service, although in the
OL,13,FUK NBC News Now does also have
OL,14,Fconventional broadcast outlets.
OL,16,FThe live nature of the news means
OL,17,Fviewers do want to dip in and out of
OL,18,Fnews coverage, even with set times for
OL,19,Fheadlines, but not necessarily on a
