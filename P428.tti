OL,11,FMs Ellerton adopted Whiskas in 2007
OL,12,Fafter finding her abandoned in a hedge
OL,13,Fas a kitten. She disappeared from the

OL,6,F"When I saw the RSPCA Facebook post it
OL,7,Fmentioned the DH4 postal area where
OL,8,Fwe'd lived and I thought it can't

OL,11,Fthought the photos looked like her,
OL,12,Fbut it had been so long and we'd never
OL,13,Fthought we'd see her again.
OL,15,F"We microchipped Whiskas when we lived
OL,16,Fin Gateshead after we rescued her and
OL,17,Fanother cat as kittens. They both went
OL,18,Fon to have litters with most of the
OL,19,Fcats having since been rehomed.
