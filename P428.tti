OL,15,FTariq Mahmood from the local residents

OL,6,FSir Keir replied: "Anti-social
OL,7,Fbehaviour affects so many people,
OL,8,Fsometimes it's described to me as low
OL,9,Flevel, it isn't in the impact it has
OL,10,Fparticularly when it comes to off-road
OL,11,Fbikes and that's why we're
OL,12,Fimplementing tough new respect orders,
OL,13,Fwhich will give powers to the police,
OL,14,Fincluding powers to seize off-road
OL,15,Fbikes, but crucially adds a power of
OL,16,Farrest for breach of the orders."
