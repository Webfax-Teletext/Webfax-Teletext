OL,11,FHe said it was no fault of his that
OL,12,Fthe 14-year-old somehow collided with
OL,13,Fa kitchen knife that he had
OL,14,Faccidentally swiped to the very edge

OL,14,FDr Bolton's findings were two-fold.
OL,15,FFirstly, that the 11cm wound that
OL,16,Fpierced Scarlett's lung and heart was
OL,17,Ffar too deep to have been cause by a
