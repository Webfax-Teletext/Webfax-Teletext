OL,3,CThe golf course facing 'existential'
OL,4,Cthreat from coastal erosion
OL,6,FSteve Lockley, from the club, told ITV
OL,7,FTyne Tees it was "existential" for the
OL,8,Fcourse which has already lost land to
OL,9,Fthe sea.
OL,11,FHe said: "It's taken away, basically
OL,12,Fhalf of our fifth tee green. So we're
OL,13,Fliterally a metre away from losing
OL,14,Fthat entire green if we got another
OL,15,Fwind and flood of that level again,
OL,16,Fintensity.
OL,18,F"So it's pretty existential for a golf
OL,19,Fcourse. Because we're a nine hole golf
OL,20,Fcourse, we don't want to be an eight
OL,21,Fhole golf course."
