OL,6,FMcNulty, who comes from County Durham,
OL,7,Fwas awarded an MBE in the King's
OL,8,FBirthday Honours list last month for
OL,9,Fhis services to swimming giving him
OL,10,Fhis time in the limelight.
OL,12,F"My job's usually to make sure the
OL,13,Fswimmers become either world champions
OL,14,For Olympic Champions, and they get
OL,15,Fthem," McNulty said. "I think we got
OL,16,Fthree of my swimmers at the last
OL,17,FOlympics got MBEs and I just got it
OL,18,Fand thought, wow, that's actually
OL,19,Fsomething that I've done for me."

OL,6,FOne of the athletes McNulty has
OL,7,Fcoached directly is Tom Dean. The 24-
OL,8,Fyear-old made Olympic history in Tokyo
OL,9,Fby becoming the first British male
OL,10,Fswimmer to win two gold medals at the
OL,11,Fsame games.
OL,13,F"Without bigging him up to much, of
OL,14,Fcourse I owe all my success to Dave,"
OL,15,FDean said. "The work I've done with
OL,16,FDave has been instrumental in allowing
OL,17,Fme to hit that senior performance
OL,18,Flevel. Win Olympic gold medals, world
OL,19,Fchampionship golds, commonwealth golds
