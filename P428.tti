OL,10,FIt is just after eight in the evening

OL,14,FThe cameraman suggests we film the

OL,18,F"It'll give us cover," he says. Cover

OL,8,FThe anticipation releases a burst of

OL,12,FWill he be with other gang members?
OL,13,FWill he be tooled up? Will he take

OL,16,FHe appears from the shadows of an
