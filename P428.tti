OL,6,FA jar of cooking sauce which went out
OL,7,Fof date nearly 26 years ago has been
OL,8,Fdonated to a food bank.
OL,10,FVolunteers at Sunderland and County

OL,13,FBen's Gratins Dauphinoise Cheese &
OL,14,FOnion Sauce for Potatoes among the
OL,15,Fdonations which they had received in
OL,16,FChester-le-Street.
OL,18,FThe glass jar, label and lid remained
OL,19,Fin good condition but the sauce -
OL,20,Fwhich had a best-before date of 9 June
OL,21,F1998 - had turned grey.

OL,6,F"This is the oldest and most random
OL,7,Fthing we have ever had," said
OL,8,Fwarehouse manager Jonathan Conlon. "We
OL,9,Fhave got some volunteers who are
OL,10,Fyounger than this jar of cooking
OL,11,Fsauce, which is crazy.

OL,6,F"It wasn't even born in 1998, it was
OL,7,Fborn before that. It would have been
OL,8,Fout of date on the 9 June 1998. This
OL,9,Fwas probably bought or packaged 27
OL,10,Fyears ago. I googled it and nothing
OL,11,Fcame up online.
OL,13,F"If you don't look at the contents of
OL,14,Fthe jar it looks in good nick. The
OL,15,Fcontents look really grey and pasty.
OL,16,FThe label is still really clear and

OL,6,F"It appears it's been lovingly stored

OL,9,Fthe date.
OL,11,FFortunately, the mistake was spotted
OL,12,Fbefore the sauce could reach anyone's

OL,14,Fhave seen the funny side but have
OL,15,Furged those considering donating to

OL,18,F"If people are able to donate and
