OL,6,FJamie, 11, has struggled to attend
OL,7,Fschool since the Covid pandemic and
OL,8,Flives with anxiety.
OL,10,FHe told ITV News Tyne Tees: "It's
OL,11,Fquite difficult going to school, but
OL,12,Fhere it's just a place where I can
OL,13,Frelax, you know, have fun, do some
OL,14,Fgardening. It's helped me because I
OL,15,Ftend to be more calm at school, once
OL,16,FI've been to the gardening, every
OL,17,FWednesday."

OL,8,Fsince attending the allotment: "He is
OL,9,Fstarting to engage better at school.
OL,10,FThe family worker said to us that he
OL,11,Fwas smiling and he was happy in one of
OL,12,Fhis lessons yesterday, you know, and
OL,13,Fit was really nice to hear that. You
OL,14,Fknow, and I feel that this has been a

OL,19,FEngland at 2.32%, with children
