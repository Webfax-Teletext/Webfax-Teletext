OL,12,F"He's just been lying there on the sea

OL,14,Fthink he will be heading off once the

OL,6,F"The customers have been delighted to
OL,7,Fsee him, as have the ferry crew. We
OL,8,Foften spot seals in the river, down
OL,9,Fnear the North Shields landing, when
OL,10,Ftheir heads pop up for a few seconds,
OL,11,Fbut we've never seen one right out of
OL,12,Fthe water before.
OL,14,F"You can tell he's a juvenile seal.
OL,15,FHe's still got some fur and he's got a
OL,16,Flot of personality. It's a wonderful
OL,17,Fsight and we are keeping a close eye
OL,18,Fon him to ensure that he's not in any
OL,19,Fdistress."
