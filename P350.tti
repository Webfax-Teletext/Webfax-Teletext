OL,13,FLast November, the BBC announced plans

OL,15,FBBC Radio Foyle, as well as hourly news
OL,16,Fbulletins and the 30-minute lunchtime
OL,17,Fnews programme. Eight journalist

OL,13,Facross the North West region, we have
OL,14,Fsucceeded in securing hourly radio

OL,16,Fof a breakfast news programme on the
