OL,6,GThere was a little surprise for
OL,7,Gviewers during BBC Breakfast this
OL,8,Gmorning.  The regional news bulletin
OL,9,Gat 7.55am has been reinstated without
OL,10,Gmuch of a fanfare.
OL,12,FAlthough this bulletin is shorter
OL,13,Fthan the others, it effectively means
OL,14,Fthat the regional news provision
OL,15,Fduring the programme is now back to
OL,16,Fwhere it was before the pandemic.
OL,18,FThe early morning regional news
OL,19,Fservice has had something of a bumpy
OL,20,Fride over the past three years.

OL,6,FIn the dark days of March 2020 it was
OL,7,Fdropped completely. Opts in the
OL,8,Fnations resumed as restrictions eased
OL,9,Fbefore early morning bulletins
OL,10,Freturned to the English regions `
OL,11,Fthough there were later occasions
OL,12,Fwhen English opts had to be dropped

OL,15,FIn the English regions there have
OL,16,Falso been a number of occasions when
OL,17,Fneighbouring services have been
OL,18,Fmerged ` often though not always as a
OL,19,Fresult of Covid-related absences.

OL,6,FBut with life now normal again, it
OL,7,Fseems right to be offering a full
OL,8,Fservice.
OL,10,FThere is an important question though
OL,11,Fabout the amount of repetition within
OL,12,Fthe bulletins. Each half-hourly
OL,13,Fbulletin can seem very similar in the
OL,14,Fabsence of a developing story.
OL,16,FIt might seem a chore to see the same
OL,17,Fthing twice. The onus should be on
OL,18,Fthe presenter and journalist
OL,19,Foutputting the opts to freshen up
OL,20,Fscripts as the morning progresses.

OL,6,FIt's thought a typical Breakfast
OL,7,Fviewer sees between 30 and 40 minutes
OL,8,Fof the programme so there was a logic
OL,9,Fin dropping one of the bulletins.
OL,11,FBut on the other hand the programme's
OL,12,Faudience peaks around 8am. The loss
OL,13,Fof the 7.55am bulletin was
OL,14,Fsignificant to the nations and
OL,15,Fregions.  Hopefully the new pattern
OL,16,Fis an acceptable compromise.
OL,18,FThe regional news, weather and travel
OL,19,Fservice during Breakfast is one of

OL,6,FThe service is much more

OL,8,F` three hourly bulletins of

OL,10,Fplus a short local weather forecast
OL,11,Fwhich would appear to be recorded the
