OL,6,GIreland's free-to-air television
OL,7,Gplatform Saorview looks set to grow
OL,8,Gfurther following a technical
OL,9,Greconfiguration earlier this month.
OL,11,FExtra capacity has been added after
OL,12,Fencoder changes on the platform's
OL,13,Fsecond multiplex.
OL,15,FThis has allowed Saorview to
OL,16,Freinstate its information channel.
OL,17,FBut it also means there's now
OL,18,Fsufficient capacity for up to 3 new
OL,19,Fstandard definition channels or 1 new
OL,20,FHD channel.

OL,6,FThe mux 2 encoder upgrade means 2rn,
OL,7,Fthe operator of Saorview, can now
OL,8,Fcompress some of its channels without
OL,9,Freducing picture quality.
OL,11,FThis extra compression means services
OL,12,Fwhich used to fill up the entire
OL,13,Fbandwidth of multiplex 2 (24Mbps)
OL,14,Fcan now do so in 19.2 Mbps, freeing
OL,15,Fup 4.8 Mbps for new services.

OL,6,FOf course, some longtime Saorview
OL,7,Fviewers may wish that the extra
OL,8,Fcapacity could be used to boost HD
OL,9,Fresolution of its channels from 1440
OL,10,Fx 1080 to 1920 x 1080, or that VM 1
OL,11,Fmight eventually also go HD on the
OL,12,Fplatform.
OL,14,FBoth options might constitute
OL,15,Ffanciful thinking. Virgin Media and
OL,16,Fbefore that TV 3, have not always
OL,17,Fbeen complimentary of Saorview and
OL,18,Fthe cost of broadcasting on that
OL,19,Fplatform. And RTE has not signalled

OL,6,FFreeview of course went through this
OL,7,Fprocess in the 2000s when commercial
OL,8,Fdemand incentivised multiplex

OL,13,FThere is of course only so much
