OL,10,Fwhether there was a case to change the

OL,12,FChannel 5.

OL,6,FCelebrity, you'll be aware of the kind
OL,7,Fof archaic compromises ITV has to make
OL,8,Fto stay within the rules.
OL,10,FITV is allowed 40 minutes of
OL,11,Fadvertising between 6pm and 11pm with
OL,12,Fno more than 12 minutes in each hour.
OL,14,FOn a typical weeknight, there are 4
OL,15,Fminutes of ads before 7pm with the
OL,16,Fremaining 36 minutes shared out between
OL,17,F7pm and the start of News at Ten.

OL,5,FIt is important to look properly at
OL,6,Fwhether there are genuine economic
OL,7,Fbenefits to advertisers and
OL,8,Fbroadcasters from allowing more
OL,9,Fadvertising. It is possible they may
OL,10,Fconclude that the same amount of
OL,11,Fadvertising spending could simply be
OL,12,Fspread more thinly.
OL,14,FIt should also be clear that
OL,15,Fbroadcasters do not need to use their
OL,16,Fwhole allocation if they conclude that
OL,17,F"less is more"  could rationed
