OL,6,GOn Tuesday I discussed the creative
OL,7,Gand scheduling implications of ITV's
OL,8,Gdecision to cut the amount of
OL,9,GEmmerdale and Coronation Street.
OL,11,FThe move does have potential benefits
OL,12,Ffor viewers.
OL,14,FBut it is also important to
OL,15,Facknowledge the implications of the
OL,16,Fdecision for production staff.
OL,18,FStatements have been issued by the
OL,19,Fbroadcasting union Bectu and

OL,6,FIt is to be hoped that compulsory
OL,7,Fredundancies can be avoided.
OL,9,FIt is also to be hoped that the
OL,10,Fdecision to produce less of Emmerdale
OL,11,Fand Coronation Street frees up
OL,12,Fresources and airtime for other well-
OL,13,Fresourced programmes of quality.
OL,15,FWe still don't know what ITV plans to
OL,16,Fdo earlier in the evening.
OL,18,FMight the 7.30pm slot accommodate a
OL,19,Frange of worthwhile programmes such as
OL,20,FTonight and the Martin Lewis Money

OL,9,FFor the sake of argument, might ITV 1
OL,10,Fmove The Chase to 5.30pm and run the

OL,14,FThe "extra" time in the afternoon
