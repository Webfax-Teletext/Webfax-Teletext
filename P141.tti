OL,5,
OL,6,FIt was interesting to read a claim on a
OL,7,Fforum that it was a surprise that
OL,8,FBritish TV still had announcers.
OL,10,FIt is never a bad thing to question
OL,11,Fconventions. Sometimes things are
OL,12,Fsimply done through habit or tradition.
OL,14,FThis week ITV 1 reintroduced idents
OL,15,Fbefore their key morning programmes.
OL,16,FHowever the idents are voiced by

OL,5,
OL,6,FMost TV channels in the UK and Ireland
OL,7,Ffollow the same convention ` an ident
OL,8,Fwith a voiceover (either live or
OL,9,Frecorded) precedes virtually all
OL,10,Fprogrammes.
OL,12,FOf course, this is a relatively new
OL,13,Fconvention which was an evolution of
OL,14,Fthe standard BBC practice in the 60s
OL,15,Fand 70s.
OL,17,FIt was not unusual on ITV back then to

OL,5,

OL,13,FFor the same reason, some ITV regions

OL,16,Fwithdrawn in 1988.
OL,18,FSoon most regions realised how this
