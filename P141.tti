OL,6,GOn Friday Channel 4's daytime magazine
OL,7,Gshow Steph's Pack Lunch bowed out.
OL,9,FIt had modest ratings, despite a loyal
OL,10,Faudience, so it was perhaps an
OL,11,Finevitable decision. Even in the best
OL,12,Fof times, decisions are taken to move
OL,13,Fresources about.
OL,15,FCorporately though, it was a
OL,16,Fsignificant part of Channel 4's
OL,17,Findustry strategy. It helped to
OL,18,Frebuild the capacity for live daily
OL,19,Fproduction in Leeds.
