OL,6,FIt was minded to allow the three
OL,7,Fchannels to run as much advertising
OL,8,Fas the other commercial channels but
OL,9,Fplanned to keep the rules which place
OL,10,Ftighter limits on the number of
OL,11,Finternal breaks they can show.
OL,13,FIn particular, one break would still
OL,14,Fbe the maximum allowed in a programme
OL,15,Fscheduled for a 30 minute slot.
OL,17,FSome of the responses to this are now

OL,6,FThe views of ITV and Channel 4 are
OL,7,Fparticularly interesting, given that
OL,8,Fthe aim of the changes is to help
OL,9,Fpublic service broadcasters.
OL,11,FBoth favour increasing the total
OL,12,Fnumber of minutes of advertising
OL,13,Fwhich they can run. In practice this
OL,14,Fwould mean 12 minutes of ads all
OL,15,Fthrough the daytime and evening.
OL,17,FBoth also agree the limits on the
OL,18,Flength of internal breaks of 3
OL,19,Fminutes and 30 seconds worth of ads
OL,20,Fshould go

OL,6,FITV argued the rules should be eased
OL,7,Fto give the three channels the option
OL,8,Fto run two breaks within a half hour
OL,9,Fprogramme. It stresses it does not
OL,10,Fplan to do this even if the rules
OL,11,Fchange so this seems to be about the
OL,12,Fprinciple.
OL,14,FChannel 4 though thinks the right to
OL,15,Fshow extra internal breaks risks the
OL,16,Fviewing experience so wants the
OL,17,Fcurrent limits on internal breaks
OL,18,Fkept.

OL,6,FIn particular, the rules on the
OL,7,Flength of internal breaks could be
OL,8,Flifted immediately ` this could mean
OL,9,Flonger breaks within programmes but
OL,10,Fno ads during junctions.
OL,12,FIt's hard to see any reason for
OL,13,Fdelaying this change if Ofcom agrees
OL,14,Fto make it. It would simply give
