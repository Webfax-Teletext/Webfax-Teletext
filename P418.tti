OL,7,Flong career at ITV. An expert in his

OL,10,Finterviewed, and loved by his
OL,11,Fcolleagues.
OL,13,FIt's not always been politics. His
OL,14,Fjournalism career saw him cover
OL,15,Ftransport, crime, human interest and
OL,16,Fon one occasion - even lion-taming.
OL,18,FBut, every subject he tackled, he was
OL,19,Fknown for his superb command of
OL,20,Fjournalism and telling stories with
OL,21,Fhis knowledge and witty nature.
