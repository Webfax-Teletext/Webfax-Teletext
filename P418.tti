OL,8,Fsong, but King George IV's piano made
OL,9,Fa triumphant return to his palace in
OL,10,FBrighton today.
OL,12,FThe grand piano, given to him more
OL,13,Fthan two hundred years ago, will take
OL,14,Fpride of place in the Royal Pavilion -
OL,15,Fhis palace by the sea.
OL,17,FIt's been re-enamelled, re-varnished,
OL,18,Fand today re-tuned.
OL,20,FIt's now worth in excess of the #230
OL,21,Fthat the King paid for it in the 1820s.
