OL,6,FThree rare breed chickens were killed
OL,7,Fby foxes and a pygmy goat was

OL,11,Fchicken houses.
OL,13,FGuy Reed, General Manager at the farm,
OL,14,Fsaid "whilst they (the intruders)
OL,15,Fdon't feel they are doing any harm,
OL,16,Fthey are allowing predators to come in
OL,17,Fand take the chickens."
OL,19,FFoxes will go through the whole house
OL,20,Fif they "find out there is an open
OL,21,Fchicken house", believes Reed.
