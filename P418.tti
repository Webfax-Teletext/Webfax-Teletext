OL,7,FJustice Holgate dismissed the
OL,8,Fcampaigners' bid to overturn that
OL,9,Fdecision, finding most parts of their
OL,10,Fcase "unarguable".
OL,12,FSSWHS are now bringing an appeal
OL,13,Fagainst this decision at the Court of
OL,14,FAppeal in London.
OL,16,FIn written submissions for the group,
OL,17,FDavid Wolfe KC said the approval for
OL,18,Fthe development in July 2023 by Huw
OL,19,FMerriman, then Minister of State for
OL,20,FRail and HS2, breached a duty to act
