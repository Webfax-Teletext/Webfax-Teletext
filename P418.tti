OL,6,FThe idea for the scheme came from a
OL,7,Fmember of the Queen's Nursing
OL,8,FInstitute in 1926. Elsie Wagg
OL,9,Fsuggested raising money through the
OL,10,Fnation's obsession with gardening. A
OL,11,Fyear later the National Garden Scheme
OL,12,Fwas founded and garden owners were
OL,13,Fasked to open their gardens for 'a
OL,14,Fshilling a head'. 609 gardens opened
OL,15,Fand raised a total of #8,191.
