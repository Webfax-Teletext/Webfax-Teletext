OL,6,F"Then when the dawn came and broke, we
OL,7,Fapproached inland quite a bit. You
OL,8,Fcould see the ships and finally we got
OL,9,Fsome bangs and some gunfire and that.
OL,11,F"Then they landed on the beaches.
OL,13,F"We were flat bottomed and we went up
OL,14,Fand the chaps said 'Can't you get any
OL,15,Fcloser?' I said 'Mate if those paddles
OL,16,Fwere wheels we could take you all the
OL,17,Fway up.
OL,19,F"They got on alright they did.

OL,6,F"They had to drop off from the side,

OL,11,F"Some were staggering, some had got

OL,13,Fto clear the beaches and get on with
