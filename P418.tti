OL,13,FAccording to the simulations used for

OL,19,FThese were essential for the creation
OL,20,Fof heavy elements such as oxygen which

OL,6,FDr Whalen explained that the team,
OL,7,Fwhich included scientists from the
OL,8,FUnited Arab Emirates University,
OL,9,Fexamined two types of supernovae.
OL,11,FThese were core-collapse supernovae,
OL,12,Fwhich produce a modest amount of heavy

OL,14,FIII supernovae, which eject tens of

OL,17,FThe study found that both types of
OL,18,Fsupernovae formed dense clumps of gas
OL,19,Fenriched with water.
