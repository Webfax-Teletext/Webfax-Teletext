OL,7,F4am to 8am and when I looked through
OL,8,Fthe embarkation space I could see we
OL,9,Fwere anchored and all I could see were
OL,10,Fa mass of ships and houses and trees.
OL,12,F"I thought 'What?' No-one told us what
OL,13,Fwas happening those days. And then one
OL,14,Fof the bunting tossers came down and
OL,15,Fsaid 'I have seen The Needles, we are
OL,16,Foff the Isle of Wight' and that's the
OL,17,Fonly time I knew. And the whole sea
OL,18,Fwas covered with ships.

OL,6,F"As night fell on 5 June everything
OL,7,Fhappened. I was on an escort ship, a
OL,8,Fconverted merchant ship. We had
OL,9,FSwordfish and Wildcats (aircraft) on
OL,10,Fboard and overnight all our planes had
OL,11,Fbeen painted with white stripes to
OL,12,Fshow they were friendly planes.
OL,14,F"And then in the early hours of 6 June
OL,15,Fall hell broke loose. I was 27 feet
OL,16,Fdown beneath the waterline and the
OL,17,Fonly communication I had with the
OL,18,Fbridge was a telephone.
