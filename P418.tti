OL,5,FKen Cooke, Age 98, The Green Howards
OL,7,FInterviewed 22 September 2023
OL,9,FJust 18 when he waded ashore on D-Day,
OL,10,FKen Cooke was an infantryman with 7th
OL,11,FBattalion The Green Howards which
OL,12,Fcrossed the English Channel from
OL,13,FSouthampton.
OL,15,F"When we got to Southampton Harbour
OL,16,Fyou couldn't see the harbour for
OL,17,Fships," he said.
OL,19,F"The same at Portsmouth. They said you
OL,20,Fcould walk across the harbour without
OL,21,Fgetting your feet wet.

OL,5,F"We boarded a ship at Southampton, got
OL,6,Finto our bunks and played cards or had
OL,7,Fa chat. We were called up onto the
OL,8,Fdeck and an officer explained what was
OL,9,Fgoing to happen.
OL,11,F"We had rifle, ammunition and
OL,12,Feverything all ready. Then we were
OL,13,Fcalled on deck and we could hear this
OL,14,Fnoise far away and you could see the
OL,15,Fflashes of explosions.
OL,17,F"At a certain time they said 'right
OL,18,Flads over the side to the scrambling
OL,19,Fnets.'

OL,5,F"We only had one experience of using
OL,6,Fthose nets in Aldershot at an assault
OL,7,Fcourse. That's the only time we knew
OL,8,Fabout those is when we went over the
OL,9,Fside in the Channel.
OL,11,F"It was very dodgy because the large
OL,12,Fship we were on was slowing down and
OL,13,Fthe landing craft was going quicker so
OL,14,Fyou had to be careful."
OL,16,FKen set off towards the beach as
OL,17,Fexplosions and the battleships were
OL,18,Ffiring rockets.

OL,5,FHe saw the crosspieces on the beaches

OL,9,FHe said: "On that coast there was a
OL,10,Fstrong current and over the years it
OL,11,Fhad built the sand up under the water
OL,12,Finto heaps of sand and a landing craft
OL,13,Fcoming in hit one of these lumps of
OL,14,Fsand, thought they had hit the beach
OL,15,Fand they dropped the ramp.
OL,17,F"The lads stepped off into about ten
OL,18,For fifteen feet of water with all the
OL,19,Fgear on. No chance.

OL,5,F"We were very lucky because the chap
OL,6,Fdriving our landing craft got us to
OL,7,Fthe beach and I stepped off into about
OL,8,Fsix inches of water. I wasn't worried
OL,9,Fabout the bullets or the shells or
OL,10,Fwhatever. All I was worried about was
OL,11,Fmy wet socks. I cannot explain that. I
OL,12,Fhave tried but I can't explain it.
OL,14,F"We had been told to get off the beach
OL,15,Fas quick as possible so we just
OL,16,Ffocused on getting off the beach.
OL,18,F"Some people say they saw bodies
OL,19,Ffloating in the water but I didn't

OL,5,F"You are having your breakfast," he

OL,7,Fsaying 'Where's Billy? Where's Harry?'
OL,9,F"And someone says 'Remember that tank
