OL,6,FBen Fitzcosta said: "There were
OL,7,Factually two foxes in the woodland,
OL,8,Fsomeone called the RSPCA to report
OL,9,Fthat one of them was injured. I set up
OL,10,Fmy phone to film and as I was
OL,11,Fpreparing to catch the fox with food
OL,12,Fand a grasper he ran up, sniffed the
OL,13,Fphone and ran off with it!
OL,15,F"It did make my day to be honest, the
OL,16,Fvideo is very funny. I'm glad I got my
OL,17,Fphone back - I had to jog to catch up
OL,18,Fwith him as I knew he'd dump it in a
OL,19,Fbush somewhere!
