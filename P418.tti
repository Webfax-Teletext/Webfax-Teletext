OL,7,FResidents in Sussex say they have been
OL,8,Fterrorised by foxes chewing through
OL,9,Fcables underneath their cars and
OL,10,Fcausing, in some cases, thousands of
OL,11,Fpounds worth of damage.
OL,13,FSome vehicle owners in Worthing have
OL,14,Fresorted to covering the bottoms of
OL,15,Ftheir cars with blue tarpaulin after
OL,16,Ftheir wiring came under attack.
OL,18,FMotoring groups say the animals might
OL,19,Fbe attracted to the insulation around
OL,20,Fthe wires which is made up of soy or
OL,21,Fpeanut oil.

OL,7,FOne resident, Dayan Maharaj, has had
OL,8,Fwhat she believes to be a fox try chew
OL,9,Fthrough her brake cables on three
OL,10,Fseparate occasions.
OL,12,FShe has spent #2,000 on repairs to her
OL,13,Fcar, with one dealer alone asking for
OL,14,Fthousands of pounds to fix the problem.
OL,16,FShe said: "I got into my car to go to
OL,17,Fwork, as normal, pressed the button to
OL,18,Fstart and then all of a sudden
OL,19,Feverything just pinged and the car
OL,20,Fwouldn't move."

OL,12,FAnother resident Chris Middleton said:

OL,7,FJack Cousens from the AA said: "Within
OL,8,Fcars themselves and the wires within
OL,9,Fthem, they have a soy-based covering
OL,10,Fover the wires.
OL,12,F"It's not just foxes that are
OL,13,Fattracted to them. It's any sort of
OL,14,Frodent that just has a natural chewing
OL,15,Fnature to it - so mice are equally
OL,16,Fattracted to the wires.
OL,18,F"But it's just the fact that that
OL,19,Fthey're looking for something to chew
OL,20,Fon, it's within easy reach and they
OL,21,Fjust gnaw away."
