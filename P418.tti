OL,5,FMr Randall had trained in Scotland to
OL,6,Fconstruct airfields before crossing
OL,7,Ffrom Portsmouth at the end of June and
OL,8,Flanding on Juno beach.
OL,10,FHe said: "We came over on one of those
OL,11,FYankee ships, the bigger one because
OL,12,Fof our equipment. We had to have time
OL,13,Fto get the land, it wasn't just a
OL,14,Fhundred yards long.
OL,16,F"We couldn't get to our job because
OL,17,Fthe land hadn't been taken.
OL,19,F"What we did within in a couple of
OL,20,Fhours of being there we had to go into
OL,21,Fthese woods.

OL,5,F"Because our infantry when they are on
OL,6,Fthe move any troops in the woods they
OL,7,Fwere left there, they didn't bother
OL,8,Fwith that. And that was our first job,
OL,9,Fto clear that one.
OL,11,F"It was not a big hero job but there
OL,12,Fwere a few bullets flying around. It
OL,13,Fwasn't that bad. They gave in and that
OL,14,Fwas it."
OL,16,FAfter this skirmish the squadron
OL,17,Fmembers found the designated site,
OL,18,Flevelled the land, laid track and made
OL,19,Fthe site operational in about eight

OL,5,FAdvanced landing grounds were often
OL,6,Fconstructed using tarred canvas,
OL,7,Fmatting and metal mesh and sometimes
OL,8,Fthe dust proved a problem for many

OL,11,F"It was really hard work" he said.
OL,13,F"We had to dig in every night to get
OL,14,Fout of sight. We had one blanket. If
OL,15,Fit rained that was hard luck. You got
OL,16,Fup in the morning and you never took

OL,20,Faccepted it more than the other chaps.

OL,7,Fwhich was just over the road. We saw
