OL,6,FMr Sheppard said: "We left from London
OL,7,Fdocks on an American liberty ship and
OL,8,Fjoined a convoy through the Straits of
OL,9,FDover.
OL,11,F"It was tough. We were being shelled
OL,12,Ffrom both sides and the boat behind us
OL,13,Fgot a direct hit from German artillery
OL,14,Fand they lost a lot of men."

OL,6,FAt that time some vessels were strafed
OL,7,Fby German fighters. On 6 June they
OL,8,Fmade the journey to the French coast.
OL,10,F"We had all the battleships firing
OL,11,Fover our heads and the Germans
OL,12,Freturning the fire," he said.
OL,14,F"We couldn't get right up to the beach
OL,15,Fand the first car off was a staff car
OL,16,Fwith an officer and a driver and it
OL,17,Fcompletely sank - the two of them got

OL,6,F"I was in a scout car - just me and

OL,8,Fturret just in case. He hit the water
OL,9,Fand we got soaking wet. The beach was
OL,10,Fcovered with Canadian dead.
OL,12,F"The most important thing was to get
OL,13,Foff the beach as quickly as possible
OL,14,Fbecause they were hitting the beach
OL,15,Fwith fire.
OL,17,F"We made our way towards the

OL,8,Fand the Germans dive bombed us. I got
OL,9,Fwounded with shrapnel in the leg. We
OL,10,Fhad morphine to stab in for the pain.
OL,12,F"And we were hiding under a half track
