OL,6,FMale goats are usually sold for meat
OL,7,Fbut Sue decided to put him to work
OL,8,Finstead.
OL,10,FSue said: "I started researching pack

OL,12,Fhim a saddle'.
OL,14,F"I'd already started an egg round and

OL,16,Fyou can carry them for me so I don't

OL,19,FOnce a week, Alan and Sue make the two-

OL,21,Ffreshly laid eggs.

OL,13,FA recent injury has taken its toll on
OL,14,FAlan and so Sue is hoping that Boris,
OL,15,Fone of her younger goats, can take up
OL,16,Fthe saddle.
