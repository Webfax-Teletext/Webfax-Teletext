OL,7,FFormer Top Gear presenter Jeremy
OL,8,FClarkson has said he is "not enjoying
OL,9,Ffarming" at the moment, amid a week
OL,10,Fthat has seen bovine tuberculosis
OL,11,Ffound on his Diddly Squat Farm.
OL,13,FThe TV star, 65, said he is also
OL,14,Fdealing with "a very sickly calf", and
OL,15,Fdiscovered that one of his puppies had
OL,16,Fdied on Friday morning.
OL,18,FOn Thursday, he wrote on X, formerly
OL,19,FTwitter, that a pregnant cow had
OL,20,Fcontracted the disease on his farm
OL,21,Fnear Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

OL,11,Fblase, it's a hypothetical threat.
OL,13,F"And then the vet looks up, as he did

OL,17,F"So that means we're now locked down
