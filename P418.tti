OL,7,FA GP surgery in Southampton has
OL,8,Freached "crisis point" after an eight
OL,9,Fyear dispute over rent could see it
OL,10,Fforced to close.
OL,12,FThe partners at St Peter's Surgery in
OL,13,FWoolston, fear that if the
OL,14,Fdisagreement isn't resolved, it could
OL,15,Fmean more than 6,700 patients will be
OL,16,Fforced to find alternative healthcare.
OL,18,FThe GP tenants have been paying rent
OL,19,Fto a landlord, on a figure that was
OL,20,Fbased on their passing 2011 rent.
