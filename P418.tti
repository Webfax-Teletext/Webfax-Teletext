OL,7,Fsaid: "We use these ice lollies to
OL,8,Fkeep the animals cool in the heat
OL,9,Fbecause animals do not sweat in the
OL,10,Fsame way humans do.
OL,12,F"The animals just want to get their
OL,13,Fpaws on the rewards hidden in the
OL,14,Flollies, but as they grab, lick,
OL,15,Fnibble and break them down, their
OL,16,Fmouths and paws are cooled.

OL,6,F"The food inside is carefully measured

OL,8,Fallowance so although it's lots of fun
OL,9,Fto see them with ice lollies, they
OL,10,Fstill sit within their monitored diets.
OL,12,F"Ice lollies are a great way to keep
OL,13,Fthe animals cool, but they also serve

OL,16,F"Making the animals work for their
OL,17,Ffood in creative ways, helps to
OL,18,Fstimulate them mentally and physically
OL,19,Fand forces them to use their instincts
OL,20,Fto look for food as they would in the
