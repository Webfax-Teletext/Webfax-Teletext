OL,7,FSussex Wildlife Trust has called on
OL,8,FSouthern Water to stop the use of bio-
OL,9,Fbeads in treatment water, after
OL,10,Fmillions of them were released into
OL,11,Fthe sea.
OL,13,FThe Trust's Chief Executive Chris
OL,14,FCorrigan had a private meeting with
OL,15,Fhis Southern Water counterpart where
OL,16,Fhe asked them why the spill happened,
OL,17,Fwhat the water company intend to do
OL,18,Fabout it and how they intend to
OL,19,Fprevent any future incidents.

OL,7,FThe meeting comes after the plastic

OL,9,Fwastewater - spilled into the sea when
OL,10,Ffilters failed at Southern Water's
OL,11,Fwastewater treatment works in
OL,12,FEastbourne almost a month ago.
OL,14,FThe tiny black beads have now been
OL,15,Ffound along a 50 mile stretch of
OL,16,Fcoastline - from Eastbourne, across
OL,17,Fthe beaches of Camber and along St
OL,18,FMary's Bay in Kent. Cleanup work is
OL,19,Fongoing at the site.

OL,7,FAfter the meeting, Corrigan said he
OL,8,Fwas encouraged the water firm was
OL,9,Ftaking responsibility for the incident.
OL,11,FHe said: "In terms of the clean up,
OL,12,Fthey (Southern Water) were very clear
OL,13,Fthat they've taken full responsibility
OL,14,Ffor the incident and they will pay in
