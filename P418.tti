OL,6,FA birthday cake in Oxford has left
OL,7,Fpartygoers 'bemused' after it looked
OL,8,Falmost identical to the pet dog it was
OL,9,Fbased on.
OL,11,FAnna Railton and Chris Smowton thought
OL,12,Fgetting a life-size replica of their
OL,13,Fdog, Arthur, made for their joint
OL,14,Fparty would be a good idea, but upon
OL,15,Fseeing it were shocked at how
OL,16,Frealistic it was.
OL,18,FThe cake, made by a local business in
OL,19,FOxford's Covered Market, looked almost
OL,20,Fidentical and left the couple
OL,21,F'reasonably horrified'.

OL,6,FAnna told ITV Meridian that the idea
OL,7,Fto get the cake made to look exactly
OL,8,Ftheir pet probably 'wasn't the best
OL,9,Fidea'.
OL,11,F"Arthur is eight years old," she told
OL,12,Fus. "And I thought it would be good
OL,13,Fidea to get a cake made in the shape
OL,14,Fof my dog.
OL,16,F"It's turned out that it wasn't the
OL,17,Fbest idea after all.
OL,19,F"When it turned up we were both
OL,20,Freasonably horrified actually, both of
OL,21,Fits size and its... realism."

OL,6,FSpeaking about The Cake Shop, who
OL,7,Fcreated the masterpiece, Anna said
OL,8,Fthey were 'fantastic'.
OL,10,F"They will basically make, I think,
OL,11,Fmore or less anything and always do a
OL,12,Fvery good job of it.
OL,14,F"In this case I think they did maybe
OL,15,Ftoo good a job, it was too fantastic.
OL,17,F"When we brought it out people did a
OL,18,Fdouble take, it was too realistic. So
OL,19,Fyeah, it's very much one of those
OL,20,Fthings where just because you can
OL,21,Fdoesn't mean that you should, right?"
