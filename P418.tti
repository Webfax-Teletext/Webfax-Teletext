OL,5,F"There were so many wireless sets in
OL,6,Fthat small area. We had an officer
OL,7,Fthere and we had to keep the
OL,8,Fcommunication open. We had a set
OL,9,Fprocedure. You didn't give names or
OL,10,Funits. We had to teach the officers
OL,11,Fand I remember teaching a doctor and
OL,12,Fwhen he first used it he switched it
OL,13,Fon and froze.
OL,15,F"He said 'I can do an operation but
