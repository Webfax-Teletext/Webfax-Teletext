OL,6,FA mother from Andover says none of her
OL,7,Feight children have seen an NHS
OL,8,Fdentist for two years - because
OL,9,Fthere's a shortage in the town.
OL,11,FSophie Darmanin says she's worried how
OL,12,Fit will impact their health and it's
OL,13,Fhard to see an end in sight given the
OL,14,Flength of NHS waiting lists.
OL,16,F"Nobody at the moment is taking on NHS
OL,17,Fpatients," she said. "(My kids) are on
OL,18,Fa waiting list at the moment, but that
OL,19,Fcould take however many months maybe a
OL,20,Fyear for them to be seen."
