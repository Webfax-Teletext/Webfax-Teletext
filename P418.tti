OL,5,FMr Hendrey said: "After a while it
OL,6,Fsettles down, what he said settles
OL,7,Fdown and your nerves disappear. It
OL,8,Fdoes take a moment when you're being
OL,9,Ftold you're going into action and a
OL,10,Fmajor action at that. One minute and
OL,11,Fit's settled down and it's like you're
OL,12,Fgoing into training again.
OL,14,F"If you look at the destroyer, there's
OL,15,Ffour guns on it, two before the bridge
OL,16,Fand two in the quarter deck. And that
OL,17,Fwas the main armament.

OL,5,F"Well I was on the one just underneath

OL,7,Fand I was a cordite loader and that
OL,8,Fwas supplied from the ammunition
OL,9,Flockers.
OL,11,F"And I would load the cordite after
OL,12,Fthe shell had gone and the captain of

OL,15,FUlster stopped about half a mile off
OL,16,Fthe French shore and began firing.

OL,5,FMr Hendrey added: "We were escorting

OL,7,Fthem in. The boats they were on had no
OL,8,Farmament. So the destroyer would be
OL,9,Ftheir armament. We didn't land of
OL,10,Fcourse the Royal Navy. We just had
OL,11,Fspecial areas to blast.
OL,13,F"There was no willy nilly firing. Each
OL,14,Fship had a section and our section was
OL,15,FKing section, and that was where we
OL,16,Fhad a blast off.

OL,5,F"And that was the only time I ever
OL,6,Fknew the gun to blister, because we
OL,7,Fwere firing nonstop for about 15
OL,8,Fminutes. And the barrel gets hot. They
OL,9,Fwill only stand so much heat.
OL,11,F"The landing craft were on the way
OL,12,Fbefore we finished firing. It was very
OL,13,Fwell organised.
OL,15,F"In point of fact we didn't really

OL,18,Fhit it. When we fired a shell we
