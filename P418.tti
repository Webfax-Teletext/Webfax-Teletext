OL,7,Frecollection is 68 American soldiers -
OL,8,Fwonderful chaps they were.
OL,10,F"All around my age - 19,20,21, and the
OL,11,FDutch crew all spoke English.
OL,13,F"The Americans were on the ship for at
OL,14,Fleast three days and as you can
OL,15,Fimagine their accommodation wasn't
OL,16,Fgreat. It was in the hold."

OL,11,F"There were so many ships and people

OL,6,FMr Gravells said: "All the ships were
OL,7,Ffiring at it but it was a bit out of

OL,9,Fin my range I opened fire on it.
OL,11,F"As it was right over the top of us it
OL,12,Fburst into flames.
OL,14,F"The pilot would have had no chance at
OL,15,Fall, and it spiralled out of control

OL,6,F"The real fighting had been on the
OL,7,Fbeach. There were bodies floating
OL,8,Fabout in the sea when we arrived. We
OL,9,Fcouldn't get that close but we could
OL,10,Fsee. It was quiet. To the best of my
OL,11,Fknowledge, and no-one ever told us and
