OL,9,FMajor changes that could see
OL,10,FWinchester lose its Accident and
OL,11,FEmergency department, and much of its
OL,12,Fmaternity provision, are being
OL,13,Fconsidered by health bosses.
OL,15,FUnder proposals being put forward by
OL,16,Fthe NHS, those services would be
OL,17,Fprovided instead at a new acute
OL,18,Fhospital 'hub' around 20 miles away.
OL,19,FIt would be sited just off the M3
