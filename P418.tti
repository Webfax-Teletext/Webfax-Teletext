OL,6,FThe result, they say, is that many get

OL,10,FShe said: "The trouble is that it

OL,12,Flot of care and a lot of time that
OL,13,Fgoes into these animals and the

OL,16,F"Come the New Year, we get a large
OL,17,Finflux of animals needing to come into

OL,21,F"It is really heart-breaking."

OL,6,FKeki's Rescue currently looks after

OL,8,FGuinea pigs are originally from the

OL,12,F"They're very very friendly animals,"
OL,13,FKeki explained, adding that the rescue

OL,15,Ftherapy.
OL,17,F"We do use some of my personal guinea

OL,6,FIn the lead up to Christmas, the
OL,7,Frescue centre is now asking people to
OL,8,Fresearch the long-term costs of owning
OL,9,Fa guinea pig and wait until after the
OL,10,Fholidays to decide whether they want
OL,11,Fto buy one.
OL,13,FShe said: "You just need to stop and
OL,14,Fthink, because you could go to
OL,15,Fsomewhere and get a pair of guinea
OL,16,Fpigs that really don't like being held
OL,17,F(...) and they could end up biting you.
OL,19,F"We're not doing any adoptions now.
OL,20,FWe'll start up again on the 2nd
OL,21,FJanuary."
