OL,5,F"We took off. Didn't know, a mystery.
OL,6,FWe just dropped wondering what was
OL,7,Fgoing to happen. It's three seconds
OL,8,Ffrom when you leave the plane to when
OL,9,Fyou hit the ground.
OL,11,F"You haven't got time to think.
OL,13,F"You've got too much to do.
OL,15,F"The job, with a rifle strapped to
OL,16,Fyour leg. You have to lower that and
OL,17,Fthen you have to orient your position
OL,18,Fwhere you're going to land. Everything
OL,19,Ffalls into place. When you jump it's
OL,20,Fthe biggest shambles ever but you soon
OL,21,Fsort yourself out.

OL,5,F"What we used was coloured smoke for
OL,6,Fdifferent companies and different
OL,7,Fbattalions."
OL,9,FMr Trewin took part in the battle for
OL,10,FCaen - a key strategic target for the
OL,11,FAllies. It took them until the first
OL,12,Fweek of August to take control of the
OL,13,Fcity and vicinity.
OL,15,FHe said: "You automatically become
OL,16,Finvolved in the fighting and then you
OL,17,Fhave patrols to do and different
OL,18,Fthings. You shut your mind to it. You
OL,19,Fhave to.

OL,5,F"A piece of shrapnel (hit my
OL,6,Fforehead). We were marching along the
OL,7,Froad and they were firing 20mm cannons
OL,8,Fdown the road like machine guns - and
OL,9,Fbursting shells. It's still there.
OL,10,FThere was no way to get any help.
OL,12,F"The worst thing I saw was a mortar
OL,13,Fbomb dropped amongst three officers
OL,14,Fand two of them had their legs blown
OL,15,Foff. I was here and they were.... And

OL,5,F"The thing I remember most was all the
OL,6,Fmarching. Because being a parachute
OL,7,Fbattalion, we had no transport. Well,
OL,8,Fthe only transport was feet."
OL,10,FThe battalion returned to England
OL,11,Fbefore later being sent to the
OL,12,FArdennes in north eastern France.
OL,14,F"It's something that had to be done
