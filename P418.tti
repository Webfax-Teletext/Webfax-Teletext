OL,6,FThe decline of the nightclub scene is
OL,7,Fhelping to boost demand for music
OL,8,Ffestivals, the founder of an award-
OL,9,Fwinning event has said.
OL,11,FJames Ralls helped launch the
OL,12,FVictorious Festival in Portsmouth in
OL,13,F2012 when it was a modestly sized
OL,14,Fevent held at the Hampshire city's
OL,15,Fhistoric dockyard.
OL,17,FThe event moved to Southsea Common two
OL,18,Fyears later, where it has expanded in
OL,19,Fsize and ambition, with headline acts
OL,20,Fincluding Ian Brown, Sam Fender,
OL,21,FMumford and Sons and Jamiroquai.
