OL,6,FHe said a dike which funnels rainwater
OL,7,Finto underground pipes is not fit for
OL,8,Fpurpose, and has not been addressed
OL,9,Fdespite his complaints in recent
OL,10,Fmonths.JMr Stephenson said: "The

OL,12,Fjust turn a blind eye to it. We all
OL,13,Fpay our taxes, we expect to get things
OL,14,Flike this done, especially when
OL,15,Fthere's no street lighting."JEast

OL,17,Fto fix the issue.JA spokesperson said:
OL,18,F"Despite the drainage being privately
OL,19,Fowned, the council recently carried
OL,20,Fout improvement works... The council
OL,21,Fintends to carry out further drainage
