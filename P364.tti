OL,9,Fto the "negligence and poor care" of
OL,10,Fhis father, Matthew, who pleaded

OL,12,Fbeen dealt with by the courts.
OL,14,FMr Smith said: "This case is a tragic
OL,15,Fone.
OL,17,F"It involved the death of a 12-year-
OL,18,Fold boy called Callum Rycroft who,
OL,19,Fbecause of the negligence and poor
OL,20,Fcare of his father, found himself
OL,21,Fcrossing the M62 on 5 August 2023."
