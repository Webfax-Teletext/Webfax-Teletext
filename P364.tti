OL,7,Fwouldn't have been especially
OL,8,Fconcerned about telling you the detail
OL,9,Fof the previous incident but it
OL,10,Fobviously becomes relevant when she
OL,11,Fseeks to portray herself as a battered
OL,12,Fwife.
OL,14,F"When she says she had no sense of
OL,15,Fself, and he dominated her thoughts
OL,16,Fand physically. When she seeks to show
OL,17,Fherself in that way it becomes
OL,18,Fnecessary to show the whole side of
OL,19,Fthe story."
