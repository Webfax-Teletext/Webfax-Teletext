OL,10,Fwith 250 enquiries within 24 hours of

OL,13,FBut the couple are having to campaign
OL,14,Fto keep the pool open after being told
OL,15,Fthey need commercial planning approval.
OL,17,FTheir planning application has

OL,6,FMr Gardiner said there was huge demand
OL,7,Ffor their facility.
OL,9,F"Local pools such as Ossett Academy,
OL,10,Fwhere swimming lessons were held up to
OL,11,Ftwo years ago, that has since shut,
OL,12,Fand they closed Dewsbury swimming
OL,13,Fbaths, which is about three and a half
OL,14,Fmiles from here," he said.
OL,16,F"So the demand was phenomenal, I
OL,17,Fcouldn't believe how many people
OL,18,Fwanted to hire the pool in my back

OL,14,FThe couple received planning consent
