OL,3,CCouncil: 'too dangerous' to move dead
OL,4,Cwhale washed up on beach
OL,6,FHead of Harbours and Coastal
OL,7,FInfrastructure, Chris Bourne, said:
OL,8,F"We always look to remove animal
OL,9,Fremains when they wash up on our
OL,10,Fshore. However, on this occasion the
OL,11,Farea is inaccessible and would prove
OL,12,Ftoo dangerous for our team and their
OL,13,Fequipment.
OL,15,F"Having been in touch with the RSPCA,
OL,16,Fthe body is so badly decomposed,
OL,17,Fmoving it is not an option."
OL,19,FIt is thought the animal, which is
OL,20,Faround 5m long, is a minke whale.
