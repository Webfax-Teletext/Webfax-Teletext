OL,6,FKing Richard III has been given a
OL,7,FYorkshire accent after a project to
OL,8,Fbring him back to life in digital form.
OL,10,FAn avatar of the last King of the
OL,11,FHouse of York addressed an audience at
OL,12,Fthe city's Theatre Royal, in his first
OL,13,Fpublic speech in over 500 years.
OL,15,FIt followed a decade-long research
OL,16,Fproject to establish the voice and
OL,17,Fappearance likely to bear the closest
OL,18,Fpossible resemblance to the 15th
OL,19,Fcentury king.

OL,6,FThe actor who voiced the avatar,
OL,7,FThomas Dennis, said: "We definitely
OL,8,Fagreed on there being a northern
OL,9,Finfluence, because he spent a lot of
OL,10,Fhis time in the north, in Yorkshire,
OL,11,Fand it was very special to him, so we
OL,12,Freally have tried to give it a little
OL,13,Fbit of that flavour.
OL,15,F"It's not completely northern and it's
OL,16,Fnot a northern sound necessarily but
OL,17,Fis has influences that you should be
OL,18,Fable to hear in it because it's likely
OL,19,Fhe would've had that sound."

OL,6,FRichard III was king of England from

OL,10,FHis remains were found under a council
