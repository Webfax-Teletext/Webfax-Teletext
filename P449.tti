OL,6,FPointing out Smyth opted not to give
OL,7,Fevidence at his trial, Mr Murphy said
OL,8,Fthe defendant's involvement in a
OL,9,Fmurder just months prior to the
OL,10,Fmurders of Mr Convie and Mr Fox
OL,11,Findicated he was "a man who was well
OL,12,Fwilling and was able to obtain a gun
OL,13,Fand with little or no qualms ... to
OL,14,Fkill Catholics."
OL,16,FThe prosecutor said Smyth's failure to
OL,17,Ftake the stand meant he could not be
OL,18,Fquestioned about this bad character,
OL,19,Fhis DNA on the jacket or any other
OL,20,Fallegations about his involvement in
OL,21,Fthe murders in January and May 1994.

OL,6,FMr Murphy concluded by telling Mr

OL,17,FNext to address the trial judge was
