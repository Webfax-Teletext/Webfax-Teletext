OL,8,FRegulator chief has said.
OL,10,FThe company that runs the region's

OL,14,FLast month a report by the Audit

OL,10,FThe Assembly earlier this week debated

OL,14,FThen, Infrastructure Minister John

OL,8,Fwhen it comes to NI Water.
OL,10,F"Nobody wants to be in this position.
OL,11,FThis has been going on for a long
OL,12,Ftime," he told the committee.
OL,14,F"If you look back at the reports back
OL,15,Fin 2007, the Water Service was

OL,18,F"Essentially the capital spending is
