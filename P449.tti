OL,6,FIn November 2017, the couple brought
OL,7,Fthe "very young child" to the GP
OL,8,Fsurgery because the child would not

OL,11,FIt emerged the child was unresponsive,
OL,12,Fbrain damaged, blind, had 27 rib
OL,13,Ffractures, shin and wrist fractures,
OL,14,Fand lacerations to the liver.
OL,16,FThe jury found Christopher Fulton
OL,17,Funanimously guilty of inflicting
OL,18,Fgrievous bodily harm with intent and
OL,19,Ftwo charges of child cruelty by
OL,20,Fwilfully neglecting the young victim.
