OL,8,Fhas warned that he is "looking down
OL,9,Fthe barrel of an inadequate budget"
OL,10,Fwhile also facing growing need.JHe
OL,11,Fwarned that the "risks of service
OL,12,Fbreakdown are real and growing in a
OL,13,Frange of areas", and said his
OL,14,Fdepartment needs an addition billion
OL,15,Fpounds for 2024/25 based on what it
OL,16,Freceived last year.JMr Swann described
OL,17,Fan "insidious position" of just two
OL,18,Fweeks before the end of the financial
OL,19,Fyear "with a budget process that
OL,20,Fhasn't started" following the
OL,21,Fresurrection of devolved government at
OL,22,Fthe end of January.

OL,21,Fthe "double whammy of budgetary
