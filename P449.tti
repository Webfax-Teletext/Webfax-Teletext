OL,10,Fthe aftermath of his sudden death.
OL,12,FHospital worker Brian McCusker took
OL,13,Fhis own life 10 months ago in west
OL,14,FBelfast.
OL,16,FHis sisters say they were given three
OL,17,Fchoices by police to see Brian
OL,18,Ffollowing the tragedy. Either at the
OL,19,Fscene, outside his mother's house,
OL,20,Fwhich they ruled out, or a third
OL,21,Foption.

OL,14,F"They pulled Brian out of the back of
OL,15,Fthe van I would say to shoulder level.
OL,16,FThey pulled a white sheet down ` and
