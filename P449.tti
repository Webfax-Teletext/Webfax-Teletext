OL,9,FNorthern Ireland, as a new 10-year

OL,13,FSpeaking to UTV, Gary Lightbody
OL,14,Freflected on the band's beginning over
OL,15,F30 years ago and the struggle to 'make
OL,16,Fit' with little to no support.
OL,18,FThe "Chasing Cars" singer says he
OL,19,Fdoesn't want artists now to have the
OL,20,Fsame beginning.

OL,7,F"Over the last five or ten years, the
OL,8,Ffunding for the arts has diminished
OL,9,Feach year, and it seems to be going
OL,10,Fback backwards to a place where
OL,11,Feventually it'll get back to that
OL,12,Fplace where there is no investment at
OL,13,Fall and you have to stop the rot at
OL,14,Fsome point," he said.
OL,16,F"You have to sort of speak up and say
OL,17,Fthis is not good enough."

OL,7,FGary Lightbody continued: "We lose so
OL,8,Fmany artists every year in Northern
OL,9,FIreland... people that just can't
OL,10,Fcontinue because they don't have any
OL,11,Fsupport. And it's those artists, the
OL,12,Fones that have no support, that need
OL,13,Fit.
OL,15,F"Music and art will always endure. But
OL,16,Fwhat I worry about is all the artists
OL,17,Fthat can't endure because they're not
OL,18,Fgetting support. You know, people well
OL,19,Fmay think that art isn't important,
OL,20,Fbut think about your life without it.
