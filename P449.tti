OL,7,Fsaid he will be recommending that
OL,8,Fpensioners in Northern Ireland have
OL,9,Ftheir winter fuel payment restored
OL,10,Ffollowing a U-turn by the UK

OL,13,FMr Lyons said the details of

OL,15,Fwere still to be worked out, but added
OL,16,Fthat the "most simple and

OL,18,Fto replicate the same approach in
