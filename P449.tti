OL,6,FNorthern Ireland's First Minister
OL,7,FMichelle O'Neill has welcomed the
OL,8,Fpassing of a vote to establish a

OL,11,FThe DUP opposed the motion at the

OL,13,Fof the role, estimated to be #1
OL,14,Fmillion a year, could not be justified
OL,15,Fin the current financial climate.
OL,17,FHowever, the draft Northern Ireland

OL,19,Fwere passed by 51 votes to 19.

OL,6,FSpeaking to reporters in the Great

OL,9,FDUP had voted against the plans.
OL,11,FShe said: "I think that the public can
OL,12,Ftake some comfort that the majority of
OL,13,FMLAs elected here understand that
OL,14,Fclimate is a real emergency,
