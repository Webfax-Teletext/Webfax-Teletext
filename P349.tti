OL,6,GEvery so often the past throws up
OL,7,Glittle mysteries. Sometimes they are
OL,8,Gvery trivial in themselves but can
OL,9,Gstill be a fascinating insight into a
OL,10,Gbygone era.
OL,12,FOne of these mysteries concerns the
OL,13,F5.35pm junction on BBC One on a handful
OL,14,Fof occasions between 1985 and 1988.
OL,16,FAs all Pres fans of a certain age will
OL,17,Fremember, this junction was not voiced
OL,18,Fby the regular announcer. Instead
OL,19,FPhillip Schofield, Andy Crane and the
OL,20,Fother CBBC presenters would do the
OL,21,Flink.

OL,6,FClearly this was an editorial decision
OL,7,F` not just an operational necessity
OL,8,Fbecause they were in the broom
OL,9,Fcupboard.
OL,11,FIt would have been easy enough for the
OL,12,Fregular announcer to record a link or
OL,13,Fuse the lip mic which was apparently
OL,14,Flocated in the main NC1 control room
OL,15,Ffor emergencies. (This happened
OL,16,Fregularly during the link before CBBC
OL,17,Fat 3.50pm after the start of the new
OL,18,Fdaytime schedule in 1986 when the
OL,19,Fregional news stopped providing a
OL,20,Fbuffer.)

OL,6,FCreatively, it was always a little
OL,7,Fawkward having the CBBC presenter link
OL,8,Finto the 5.35pm programme. In those
OL,9,Fdays, the voice behind the globe really
OL,10,Fdid help to establish the authority of
OL,11,Fthe BBC.
OL,13,FBut when the link was simply into The
OL,14,FFlintstones, Cartoon Time or the
OL,15,Fschools quiz First Class it hardly
OL,16,Fmattered in practice.
OL,18,FIt was maybe more of an issue when the
OL,19,F5.35pm programme was not particularly
OL,20,Fchild friendly ` say Masterteam.

OL,6,FBut what about the occasions when a
OL,7,Fsignificant or important programme was
OL,8,Fbeing shown at 5.35pm?
OL,10,FDuring the 1986 Mexico World Cup,
OL,11,FPhillip was allowed to link into the
OL,12,Fregular highlights programme shown
OL,13,Fbetween CBBC and the Six o'Clock News.
OL,15,FOuch.
OL,17,FYou can begin to see why some in
OL,18,FPresentation were apparently less than
OL,19,Fkeen on having someone who wasn't an
OL,20,Fannouncer in the continuity suite.

OL,6,FBut here's an even bigger question.
OL,8,FThere were a few occasions between 1985
OL,9,Fand 1987 when the regional news moved
OL,10,Fto 5.35pm to accommodate extended
OL,11,Feditions of the Six o'Clock News or
OL,12,Fother special output.
OL,14,FOutside London and the South East, of
OL,15,Fcourse, there would have been a
OL,16,Fstandard opt-out link.
OL,18,FBut what was happening in NC1 Con? Were
OL,19,FPhillip and Andy really linking into
OL,20,FLondon Plus?

OL,9,FAn announcement before the news by
OL,10,Fsomeone who didn't represent the
