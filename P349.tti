OL,7,Frotation of ITV Creates idents. This
OL,8,Fweek, Neequaye Dreph Dsane's idents get
OL,9,Fanother airing on the channel. They
OL,10,Fwere first used on ITV in October 2020
OL,11,Fto mark Black History Month.
OL,13,FITV: "Neequaye's work attempts to
OL,14,Fpresent an alternative narrative and a
OL,15,Freflection of the contemporary black
OL,16,FBritish experience."
OL,18,FTonight's edition of BBC London was not
OL,19,Fbroadcast from Studio B as planned. Due
OL,20,Fto technical issues, the programme had
OL,21,Fto decamp to Studio D.
