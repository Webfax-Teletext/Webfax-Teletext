OL,6,GThe merger of the BBC News Channel and
OL,7,GBBC World News is expected to have a
OL,8,Gsoft launch on 6th March.
OL,10,FBut regular viewers will by now be used
OL,11,Fto seeing programmes in the evenings
OL,12,Fand weekends which are designed for
OL,13,Fviewers around the globe as well as
OL,14,Fthose at home.
OL,16,FIt poses huge editorial dilemmas.
OL,17,FStories of vital importance and
OL,18,Frelevance to UK viewers may be of
OL,19,Flittle interest or significance abroad.
OL,20,FStories of global importance may seem
OL,21,Fdetached from the lives of most people
OL,22,Fin the UK.

OL,6,FSaturday's combined output gave a good
OL,7,Fexample. The Nigerian election led the
OL,8,Fafternoon output.
OL,10,FObviously the main BBC One bulletin
OL,11,Fincluded a piece from Nigeria but well
OL,12,Fdown the running order. A good example
OL,13,Fof how to bring this kind of foreign
OL,14,Fstory to a mainstream audience.
OL,16,FIt is the kind of story a domestic BBC
OL,17,Foutlet might cover to demonstrate the
OL,18,Fwidth of its international coverage and
OL,19,Fbecause it is worthy of highlighting `
OL,20,Fnot because of its importance or direct

OL,6,FIt is important for a public service

OL,9,Fare concerns that Africa is reported
OL,10,Fall too rarely except in the context of

OL,13,FBut a lead story? It is not a foreign

OL,6,FPerhaps though there is a niche for a
OL,7,Fchannel focused on solid foreign
OL,8,Freporting. Nobody who cares about
OL,9,Fserious international journalism or
OL,10,Fworld affairs would say these stories
OL,11,Fshould not be covered.
OL,13,FThe context in which they appear
OL,14,Fmatters though. Imagine the risk of

OL,6,FIt is unfair to judge the new News

OL,8,Finternational news matters and not just
