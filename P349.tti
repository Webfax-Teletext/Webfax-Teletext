OL,5,GTwelve hours into ITV's rebrand,
OL,6,Gthere's a mystery in UTV Land. No
OL,7,Gpromos for local programmes were
OL,8,Gscreened today up until 6pm so far as
OL,9,Gwe can see.
OL,11,FSo we still don't know what's happening
OL,12,Fto UTV as a channel brand.
OL,14,FThe last vestiges of UTV channel
OL,15,Fbranding were in local promotions `
OL,16,Falthough the name is also used during
OL,17,Fthe regional news, weather and some
OL,18,Flocal programmes.

OL,5,FUTV promos used the endboard introduced

OL,10,FThis design was not updated when
OL,11,Fnetwork trails were refreshed in July
OL,12,F2020.
OL,14,FSo is there a new package for UTV
OL,15,Ftrails? Will local trails include ITV 1
OL,16,Fbranding? Or will local trails avoid
OL,17,Fexplicit branding?

OL,5,FThe possibility of the old design being
OL,6,Fretained for now should not be
OL,7,Fcompletely excluded ` ridiculous as it
OL,8,Fmay sound.
OL,10,FInterestingly EPGs still refer to UTV
OL,11,Falthough the entry in other regions has
OL,12,Fbeen updated now to ITV 1. However this
OL,13,Fcould be oversight as the name did not
OL,14,Factively need changed.
OL,16,FThe lack of any local trails so far
OL,17,Ftoday is surprising as UTV has an

OL,5,FThe first UTV trail appeared during I'm

OL,8,FIf this trail for Secrets of the Comedy
