OL,6,FThe Conservative Party is confused -
OL,7,Fabout how to rehabilitate and about
OL,8,Fwho should lead it.
OL,10,FThere have been races where the winner
OL,11,Fwas blindingly obvious - you could
OL,12,Fsmell the result in the air - even
OL,13,Fbefore the formal contest had begun.
OL,15,FThat was true for Tony Blair in 1994
OL,16,Fand Boris Johnson in 2019.
OL,18,FThere is no such pong at the Tory

OL,6,FJust walking through lobbies and
OL,7,Fhalls, I've asked countless Tory
OL,8,Fmembers and MPs who they are
OL,9,Fsupporting and who they think will win.
OL,11,FEvery one of the four candidates -
OL,12,FBadenoch, Cleverly, Jenrick and
OL,13,FTugendhat - has their supporters.
OL,15,FAnd although the names Jenrick and
OL,16,FBadenoch are mentioned more frequently
OL,17,Fthan others as the eventual victor,
OL,18,Fthere is not the faintest sense that
OL,19,Fthe party has made up its mind.
