OL,6,FSo I pointed out that under the now
OL,7,Fabolished cap system - which limited
OL,8,Fmaximum bonuses to 200% of salary -
OL,9,Fbankers earning #1 million would be
OL,10,Feligible for a bonus of #2 million.
OL,12,FWhy on earth would a banker need more
OL,13,Fthan that #3 million pay package? And
OL,14,Fwhy would a want to enable my
OL,15,Ffictional banker - let's call him
OL,16,FPiers Starmer-Lover - to earn even
OL,17,Fmore, ay #5 million, or #6 million or
OL,18,F#10 million?

OL,6,FFirst, Keir Starmer's Labour, like

OL,8,Fhas worked out that the UK doesn't

OL,13,FGiven Starmer's "mission" priority to
