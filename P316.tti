OL,6,F"Yes, I did help prepare the conkers
OL,7,Fbefore the tournament. But this isn't
OL,8,Fcheating or a fix, and I didn't mark
OL,9,Fthe strings. I just tried to hit hard,
OL,10,Fand somehow, I finally won," he added.
OL,12,FThe first of the event's ten
OL,13,Fparticipation rules states that: "All
OL,14,Fconkers and laces are supplied by the
OL,15,FWorld Conker Championships. Laces must
OL,16,Fnot be knotted further or tampered
OL,17,Fwith. Conkers are drawn 'blind' from a
OL,18,Fbag, and players may reject up to
OL,19,Fthree selected conkers."
