OL,7,FStorm Eowyn has brought record-
OL,8,Fbreaking winds as it batters parts of
OL,9,Fthe UK on Friday.
OL,11,FIn Ireland, winds measuring 114mph
OL,12,Fwere recorded at Mace Head, Co Galway,
OL,13,Fwhich is provisionally the strongest
OL,14,Fgust ever recorded in Ireland,
OL,15,Faccording to the Met Office.
OL,17,FThese winds could have been caused by
OL,18,Fa dangerous weather phenomenon known
OL,19,Fas a sting jet as satellite imagery
OL,20,Fsuggests this developed over Ireland
OL,21,Fon Friday morning.
