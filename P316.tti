OL,6,FIn November's vote, 14 members of the
OL,7,Fcommittee voted for the bill and nine
OL,8,Fagainst.
OL,10,FThe split of 11 backbenchers who voted
OL,11,Ffor and nine against (55% to 45%) on
OL,12,Fthe committee is almost exactly the
OL,13,Fsame ratio of how members voted in
OL,14,FNovember, which was 54% in favour to
OL,15,F46% against.
OL,17,FHowever, the way in which MPs
OL,18,Fpreviously voted does not necessarily
OL,19,Fmean that they will continue to
OL,20,Fsupport the bill through all stages.
