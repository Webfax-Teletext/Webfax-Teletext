OL,6,FThe consultancy had previously
OL,7,Fpredicted a 1% fall, but said this was
OL,8,Fnow no longer the case. The predicted
OL,9,Fhike comes after energy prices rose by

OL,12,FCornwall Insight said: "Given the
OL,13,Fprice cap rise in October, many will
OL,14,Fhave been hoping to see a fall in the
OL,15,Fcap for January. Unfortunately,
OL,16,Fforecasts show that prices will be
