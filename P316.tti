OL,7,FA fingertip device that can mimic

OL,10,Fscientists say.
OL,12,FResearchers at University College
OL,13,FLondon (UCL) developed new technology
OL,14,Fwhich "can simulate touch as natural
OL,15,Fas real-life sensations".
OL,17,FThe device, called the BAMH
OL,18,F(innovative bioinspired haptic
OL,19,Fsystem), stimulates nerve cells which
OL,20,Frespond to touch using vibrations.
