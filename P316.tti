OL,6,FThe UK, most of Europe, Japan and
OL,7,FCanada are in America's sphere of
OL,8,Finfluence, whether they like it or
OL,9,Fnot, because the alternatives -
OL,10,FChina's or Russia's - are unthinkable.
OL,12,FThat is a pragmatic fact, because the
OL,13,FUS has the military hardware and tech.
OL,14,FBut it is not permanently inevitable,
OL,15,Feven if breaking free would require
OL,16,Fmomentous investment and unusual trust
OL,17,Fand cooperation between competitor

OL,10,Fand Russia, British military support
OL,11,Ffor the US seizure of a Russian-

OL,14,FBut the creation of a coherent rival
OL,15,Fsphere of influence by nations with

OL,17,Fprovide the UK with more of a choice
