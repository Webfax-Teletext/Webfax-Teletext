OL,9,Fcampaign tactics.
OL,11,FSir Ed Davey got the final week of his
OL,12,Felection campaign off to a flying
OL,13,Fstart on Monday morning, quite
OL,14,Fliterally.
OL,16,FHe screamed, "do something you've
OL,17,Fnever done before! Vote Liberal
OL,18,FDemocrat!", as he did something he had
OL,19,Fnever done before - a bungee jump.

OL,8,Fwhich has bounced back and forth
OL,9,Fbetween Liberal Democrat and
OL,10,FConservative MPs for the past 14
OL,11,Fyears. In 2019 it went blue and, this
OL,12,Ftime, the Lib Dems are hopeful they
OL,13,Fcan take it back.
OL,15,FThe stunts are all part of the party's

OL,17,Fa couple of days to go, how well is it
OL,18,Fworking?

OL,12,FWhenever I post about them online,
OL,13,Fthere is a mixed reaction. Some people
OL,14,Fsay they think it's great that he
