OL,6,FQueen legend Sir Brian May has
OL,7,Fresigned as the RSPCA's vice president
OL,8,Fover what he called "appalling" animal
OL,9,Fwelfare standards at farms certified

OL,12,FSir Brian, who has long campaigned on
OL,13,Fanimal welfare rights, said he was
OL,14,F"heartbroken" to be withdrawing his
OL,15,Fsupport for the charity.
OL,17,FHe said that "damning evidence" has
OL,18,Fcome to light following allegations of
OL,19,Fovercrowding, poor hygiene, and in
OL,20,Fsome cases, physical abuse of
OL,21,Flivestock by farm workers.
