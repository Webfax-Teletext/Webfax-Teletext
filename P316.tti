OL,6,FWith two weeks remaining before the
OL,7,FGeneral Election, Rishi Sunak will
OL,8,Fstick with two campaigning themes
OL,9,Fwhich do not appear as yet to have had
OL,10,Fany impact on a tide that has turned
OL,11,Fagainst the Tories.
OL,13,FThe first is to point to all those
OL,14,Fpolls that signal Labour winning by a
OL,15,Fhistoric landslide, and argue that it
OL,16,Fwould be "dangerous" in a largely
OL,17,Funspecified way for Labour to become
OL,18,Fan "elected dictatorship" with a
OL,19,Fmajority of 100 or even more than 200.

OL,3,CWhy Rishi Sunak believes all hope is

OL,6,FSunak's second argument is that the
OL,7,FTories would cut taxes and Labour
OL,8,Fwould raise them - which has the
OL,9,Fadvantage of being a simple message,
OL,10,Fthough too many voters seemingly
OL,11,Feither don't believe it or don't care.
OL,12,FI won't dwell on it here.
OL,14,FSo are the Tories flogging a totally

OL,17,FThat is plausible. But here are a few

OL,3,CWhy Rishi Sunak believes all hope is
OL,4,Cnot lost
OL,6,FThe first is the mathematical
OL,7,Fcuriosity that the polls - YouGov's
OL,8,FMRP in particular - show that Labour
OL,9,Fcould win by a historically huge
OL,10,Fmargin of victory with a potential
OL,11,Fshare of the vote, perhaps 38%, which
OL,12,Fwould be less than Corbyn's Labour
OL,13,Fmore than 40% polled in 2017 when it
OL,14,Fwas nowhere near forming a government.
OL,16,FThat paradox - or eccentric
OL,17,Fconsequence of our first-past-the-post
OL,18,Fsystem - is because Reform and the Lib
OL,19,FDems seem to be picking up many more
OL,20,Fvotes than they did in 2017, most of
OL,21,Fthem from the Tories.

OL,3,CWhy Rishi Sunak believes all hope is
OL,4,Cnot lost
OL,6,FSo, there is logic to Sunak asking new
OL,7,FLib Dem and Reform voters whether they
OL,8,Fare happy at the idea they are voting
OL,9,Ffor Farage and Davey to get Starmer.
OL,11,FMany may well say they are. But it's
OL,12,Frational for Sunak to ask.
OL,14,FSecond, both Labour and Tory
OL,15,Fcampaigners believe something like 12%
OL,16,Fof voters are undecided about their
OL,17,Fvote and another 12% say their current
OL,18,Fparty preference is only mild and
OL,19,Fcould change.

OL,3,CWhy Rishi Sunak believes all hope is
OL,4,Cnot lost
OL,6,FSo, that is about a quarter of voters
OL,7,Fwho are sort of up for grabs. And that
OL,8,Fis enough to give Sunak the hope that
OL,9,Fa potential Labour landslide could -
OL,10,Fcould - be cut back to a much smaller
OL,11,Fand more conventional majority.
OL,13,FReinforcing that limited optimism - is
OL,14,Fthat well over 100 seats are also seen
OL,15,Fby both parties as too close to call.
OL,17,FThat slim margin between Tory
OL,18,Fhumiliation and respectable defeat is
OL,19,Fwhy Labour is continuing to throw
OL,20,Fresources at more seats than it had
OL,21,Fhoped to be doing so close to July 4.
