OL,6,FPresident Trump's first week has been
OL,7,Fas tumultuous as some anticipated.
OL,9,FAfter the last-minute changes to the
OL,10,Finauguration plans, forced by the cold
OL,11,Fweather, President Trump embarked on a
OL,12,Ffrenzy of executive orders, ranging
OL,13,Ffrom pulling out of the Paris Climate
OL,14,FDeal, to declaring an emergency on
OL,15,FAmerica's southern border and
OL,16,Fpardoning those convicted of offences
OL,17,Frelated to January 6.
