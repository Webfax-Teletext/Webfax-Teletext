OL,7,FA Soviet-era spacecraft is due to
OL,8,Fcrash back to Earth this week after it
OL,9,Ffailed to reach Venus more than 50
OL,10,Fyears ago.
OL,12,FThe space debris, known as Kosmos 482,
OL,13,Fis expected to re-enter Earth's
OL,14,Fatmosphere sometime around May 10,
OL,15,Fhowever, not much is known about the
OL,16,Fspacecraft, including its size and
OL,17,Fshape.

OL,15,Fthe entry capsule would be equipped
