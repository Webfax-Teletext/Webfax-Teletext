OL,7,FIn the programme, Gordon Smart takes
OL,8,Fpart in a guided breathwork and ice
OL,9,Fbath session. Studies have found that
OL,10,Fdeep breathing exercises can create
OL,11,Fshifts in our body's nervous system
OL,12,Fand reduce levels of cortisol, the
OL,13,Fstress hormone. There isn't a huge
OL,14,Famount of evidence or research into
OL,15,Fthe effects of ice baths, but it's
OL,16,Fthought they can trigger the release
OL,17,Fof endorphins which can enhance your
OL,18,Fmood and reduce stress.
