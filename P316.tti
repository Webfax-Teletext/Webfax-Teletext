OL,6,FIt plainly matters that MPs have voted
OL,7,Fin favour of the principle that the
OL,8,Fterminally ill could be helped to
OL,9,Faccelerate their deaths.
OL,11,FBut as I said on News at Ten on
OL,12,FWednesday, this is the beginning of
OL,13,Fthe important debate: it is by no
OL,14,Fmeans certain assisted dying will

OL,17,FWhat the House of Commons did this

OL,3,CWhat are the political repercussions

OL,6,FThis is important. Because in
OL,7,Fsanctioning the idea of doctors
OL,8,Fhelping the sick to die, and in a
OL,9,Fcountry with an established Church, a
OL,10,FRubicon has been crossed.
OL,12,FBut even though MP after MP said that
OL,13,Fthe compassionate decision was to help
OL,14,Fthose in unbearable pain for whom
OL,15,Fmedicine could neither offer recovery
OL,16,For respite, many of them weren't yet
OL,17,Fpersuaded that there would be adequate
OL,18,Fsafeguards or protections for the
OL,19,Fvulnerable.

OL,8,Fthe bill through revisions in the

OL,11,FAnd if they fail, they said, they
