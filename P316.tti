OL,3,C'World first': Surgeon removes apple
OL,4,Csized brain tumours through eyebrows
OL,6,FA Scottish surgeon has found a way to
OL,7,Fremove brain tumours the size of
OL,8,Fapples through patients' eyebrows, in
OL,9,Fwhat is believed to be a world-first.
OL,11,FConsultant neurosurgeon Anastasios
OL,12,FGiamouriadis of NHS Grampian, has
OL,13,Fadapted an existing technique of
OL,14,Fkeyhole surgery to remove much larger
OL,15,Ftumours from the front of the brain
OL,16,Fthan was previously the case.

OL,6,FThe new method takes far less time to
OL,7,Fcomplete than a conventional
OL,8,Fcraniotomy, which involves removing a
OL,9,Flarge part of the skull and can take
OL,10,Fup to eight hours to complete.
OL,12,FMr Giamouriadis said his keyhole
OL,13,Fmethod takes half that time and some
OL,14,Fpatients are even able to leave the
OL,15,Fhospital the next day.

OL,6,F"I have modified and developed the

OL,8,Foperating on very large brain tumours
OL,9,Fin the front of the brain and as far
OL,10,Fback as the middle of the brain," he
OL,11,Fexplained.
OL,13,F"By doing this through the keyhole

OL,16,Ftakes probably half the time ` if not
