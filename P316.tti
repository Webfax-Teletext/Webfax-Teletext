OL,7,Fproduced PFAs (Perfluoroalkyl and
OL,8,FPolyfluoroalkyl Substances), so-called
OL,9,Fforever chemicals, since 1950. They're
OL,10,Fcomplex compounds found in things like
OL,11,Fnonstick pans which are great at being
OL,12,Fwaterproof and lubricating, but last
OL,13,Fthousands of years and some can damage
OL,14,Four health.
OL,16,FOne of them, called PFOA, was rated
OL,17,Flast year as a group 1 carcinogen - or
OL,18,Fin other words, it causes cancer in
OL,19,Fhumans. It's now banned in the UK.
