OL,12,Farrived in one of the poorer

OL,14,Frelying on water rations.
OL,16,FIt was already 32C when the water

OL,18,Fcommotion as men, women and children
OL,19,Frushed towards the pipes, which
OL,20,Fsuddenly sprouted from all sides of

OL,10,FIt was a far cry from the orderly

OL,6,FOn the final weekend, while India
OL,7,FPrime Minister was enjoying his post-
OL,8,Felection meditation in a cool coastal
OL,9,Ftemple, more than 50 people -
OL,10,Fincluding 33 election workers - died
OL,11,Fdue to heatstroke.
OL,13,FAlthough the heat is thought to have
OL,14,Fcontributed to a lower turnout in some
OL,15,Fconstituencies, more than half a
OL,16,Fbillion people have still had their
OL,17,Fsay. That's just over half of the 970

OL,6,FExit polls suggest Mr Modi and his

OL,11,FThese polls have proved inaccurate in
