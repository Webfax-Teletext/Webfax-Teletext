OL,4,Cfinds 'oasis' of pure sulfur crystals
OL,6,FNASA's Curiosity rover has discovered
OL,7,Frocks made of pure sulfur on the
OL,8,Fsurface of Mars for the first time.
OL,10,FScientists were stunned when the 1-
OL,11,Ftonne rover drover over a rock,
OL,12,Fcracked it open and revealed yellowish-
OL,13,Fgreen crystals never seen before on
OL,14,Fthe red planet.
OL,16,F"I think it's the strangest find of
OL,17,Fthe whole mission and the most
OL,18,Funexpected," said Dr Ashwin Vasavada,
OL,19,FCuriosity project scientist at NASA's
OL,20,FJet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
OL,21,FCalifornia.

OL,10,FDr Vasavada added: "Finding a field of

OL,12,Ffinding an oasis in the desert.
OL,14,F"It shouldn't be there, so now we have

OL,6,FThe Curiosity team was eager for the

OL,8,Fchannel, a winding groove that appears
OL,9,Fto have been created 3 billion years

OL,6,FWhite stones had been visible in the

OL,8,Fwanted a closer look. Rover drivers at
OL,9,Fthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who

OL,16,FOn the morning of May 30, Dr Vasavada
OL,17,Fand his team looked at Curiosity's
