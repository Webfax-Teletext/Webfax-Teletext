OL,7,Fthis week has turned the 2024 election

OL,6,FIn Pennsylvania, this week we spoke
OL,7,Fwith a cross-section of voters and
OL,8,Fwhat was clear is how much work will
OL,9,Fhave to be done in that time.
OL,11,FSomehow, Kamala Harris is going to
OL,12,Fhave to build a profile and a message
OL,13,Fthat resonates with America's 24
OL,14,Fmillion undecided voters, because that
OL,15,Frelatively small group has the power
OL,16,Fto change the future direction of this

OL,19,FWhat's more, she cannot lose any
OL,20,Fvotes. That is potentially a problem.

OL,6,FIn our conversations, the most re-

OL,8,Ffemale, predominantly black, Democrat

OL,10,Ftheir votes would have been secure,
OL,11,Fbut they would have felt less

OL,14,FHowever, in other discussions, there
OL,15,Fwas less positivity and a sense that
