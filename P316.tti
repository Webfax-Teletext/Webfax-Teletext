OL,8,Fher family home when she rented it on
OL,9,Fmoving to Downing Street, lowers the

OL,13,FI am not certain all her shadow

OL,16,FThe point is that there is a clear

OL,6,FIn the case of Rayner, there was the
OL,7,Fpotential for very large personal
OL,8,Fmaterial gain. Her dismissal was
OL,9,Finevitable.
OL,11,FIn Reeves's case, it's theoretically
OL,12,Fpossible that her local council would
OL,13,Fhave imposed conditions on her when
OL,14,Frenting. And it is embarrassing for
OL,15,Fher that she had previously welcomed a
