OL,6,FA European satellite is expected to
OL,7,Ffall to Earth on Wednesday after
OL,8,Fnearly 30 years in space.
OL,10,FThe ERS-2 satellite was launched in
OL,11,F1995, following on from its sister
OL,12,Fsatellite, ERS-1, which had been
OL,13,Flaunched four years earlier.
OL,15,FAt their time of launch, the two ERS
OL,16,Fsatellites were the most sophisticated
OL,17,FEarth observation satellites ever
OL,18,Fdeveloped.
OL,20,FIn 2011, the ESA retired ERS-2 and
OL,21,Fbegan the process of deorbiting.
