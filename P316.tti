OL,6,FDisputes over the border have been a
OL,7,Flong-standing issue that has caused

OL,10,Fshare more than 800 kilometres (500

OL,13,FThe contesting claims stem largely
OL,14,Ffrom a 1907 map drawn under French
OL,15,Fcolonial rule that was used to
OL,16,Fseparate Cambodia from Thailand.
OL,18,FCambodia has been using the map as a

OL,6,FThe most prominent and violent

OL,10,FIn 1962, the International Court of

OL,15,FCambodia went back to the court in

OL,17,Fbetween its army and Thai forces,
OL,18,Fwhich killed about 20 and displaced
OL,19,Fthousands of people. The court
OL,20,Freaffirmed the ruling in 2013, a
