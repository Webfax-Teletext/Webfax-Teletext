OL,6,FThe Bank of England has cut interest
OL,7,Frates for the first time in four
OL,8,Fyears, as ITV News' Economics Editor
OL,9,FJoel Hills reports
OL,11,FIt's a cut, but a cautious one.
OL,13,FTwelve months after the last interest
OL,14,Frate rise, the cost of borrowing is
OL,15,Fheading south again.
OL,17,FThe Governor of the Bank of England,
OL,18,FAndrew Bailey, proposed to reduce Bank
OL,19,FRate from 5.25% to 5%, and the
OL,20,FMonetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted
OL,21,F5-4 for a change.
