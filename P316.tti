OL,7,FThe Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has
OL,8,Frowed back on its decision to prevent
OL,9,FAvanti's weekday 7am service from
OL,10,FManchester Piccadilly to London Euston
OL,11,Ffrom carrying passengers.
OL,13,FThe rail regulator previously said
OL,14,Fallowing Avanti West Coast to run the
OL,15,Fservice would "harm the overall
OL,16,Fperformance for all passengers" due to
OL,17,Fthe potential for congestion on the
OL,18,FWest Coast Main Line.

OL,7,FThis meant that if Avanti's 7am
