OL,6,FTwo decades ago, researchers
OL,7,Fdiscovered fossils in an Indonesian
OL,8,Fcave of an early human species who
OL,9,Fwere one metre tall, earning them the
OL,10,Fnickname 'hobbits'.
OL,12,FHowever, a new study has revealed
OL,13,Fearlier relatives that were six
OL,14,Fcentimetres shorter - and existed
OL,15,F700,000 years ago.
OL,17,FThe original hobbit fossils, named by
OL,18,Fthe discoverers after characters in
OL,19,FThe Lord of the Rings, date back to
OL,20,Fbetween 60,000 and 100,000 years ago.

OL,6,FThe new fossils were excavated at a
OL,7,Fsite called Mata Menge, about 72km

OL,11,FThe findings were published on Tuesday

OL,6,FIn 2016, researchers suspected the
OL,7,Fearlier relatives could be shorter
OL,8,Fthan the hobbits after studying a
OL,9,Fjawbone and teeth collected from the
OL,10,Fnew site. They confirmed this theory
OL,11,Fthrough further analysis of a tiny arm
OL,12,Fbone fragment and teeth.
OL,14,FResearchers have debated how the
OL,15,Fhobbits - named Homo floresiensis
OL,16,Fafter the remote Indonesian island of
OL,17,FFlores - evolved to be so small and
OL,18,Fwhere they fall in the human
OL,19,Fevolutionary story. They're thought to
OL,20,Fbe among the last early human species
OL,21,Fto become extinct.
