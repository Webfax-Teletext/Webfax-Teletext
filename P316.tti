OL,6,FMars Wrigley, the company that makes
OL,7,FTwix chocolate, argued the ad "had a
OL,8,Fcinematic presentation and was set in
OL,9,Fa separate world that was absurd,
OL,10,Ffantastical and removed from reality."
OL,12,FThey also emphasised the scenario was
OL,13,F"clearly exaggerated" and "not
OL,14,Fpossible in reality" as demonstrated
OL,15,Fby "scenes of two hands operating a
OL,16,Fgear shift, a hand brake turn that was
OL,17,Fnot possible in real life and the man
OL,18,Fshown calmly driving off a cliff."

OL,6,FThis notwithstanding, the ASA said
OL,7,Fthey, "considered the emphasis on a
OL,8,Fchase, and the speed inherent to that,
OL,9,Fand the driving manoeuvres featured

OL,14,FIn its ruling, the ASA said the ad
OL,15,Fcould not be broadcast in the UK in
OL,16,Fits current form and that it told Mars
OL,17,FWrigley Confectionery UK Ltd not to
OL,18,Fcondone or encourage irresponsible
