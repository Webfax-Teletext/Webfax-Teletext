OL,6,FEllie Glaisyer, a meteorologist at the

OL,8,Ftemperatures experienced in April were
OL,9,F"nothing exceptional" and are expected
OL,10,Fto move closer to their seasonal
OL,11,Faverages over the weekend and into the
OL,12,Fstart of next week.
OL,14,FShe said that on Wednesday and
OL,15,FThursday night "there will be some
OL,16,Ffrost in places", adding: "The reason
OL,17,Ffor (the low temperatures) is that
OL,18,Fwe've got an area of high pressure out
OL,19,Ftowards the west of the UK and that
OL,20,Fgives us a northerly wind across the
OL,21,FUK.
