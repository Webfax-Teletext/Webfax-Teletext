OL,7,FThe family of Alice Webb, who was the
OL,8,Ffirst woman in the UK to die from a
OL,9,Ffiller Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), has
OL,10,Fcalled for a "blanket ban" on the
OL,11,Fprocedures and is urging the
OL,12,Fgovernment to do more to protect
OL,13,Fpeople from botched surgery.
OL,15,FWebb, 33, died after having a non-
OL,16,Fsurgical BBL in September 2024, when
OL,17,Fit was legal for people with no
OL,18,Fmedical experience to carry out the
OL,19,Ffiller procedure.
