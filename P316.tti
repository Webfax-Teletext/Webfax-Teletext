OL,10,F"Yes, it's me," he quipped, no doubt
OL,11,Fwith some delight at all the attention
OL,12,Fhe's received.
OL,14,FHis name, and that of his party, have
OL,15,Fbeen present in almost every speech at
OL,16,Fthe Labour Party conference.
OL,18,FIt began with the prime minister's
OL,19,Faccusation that Reform's immigration
OL,20,Fpolicy was outright racist.
