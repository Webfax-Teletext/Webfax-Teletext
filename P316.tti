OL,10,FMr Maclaren explained how she was able
OL,11,Fto look so realistic, saying: "The eye

OL,13,Fbehind the eyes, actually in the eyes
OL,14,Fthemselves.
OL,16,F"The eyes are handpainted so that they
OL,17,Flook as real as possible. The facial
OL,18,Fexpressions are done through lots of
OL,19,Flittle motors underneath a silicon
OL,20,Fbased skin that will stretch and move
OL,21,Fto basically mimic the human face."
